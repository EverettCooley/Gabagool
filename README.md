## Starting out
First, after you download repo, you will need to go to the WebScraper folder and unzip the pages file. Next you will need to run the HW4.py Script to get your indexes for searching with whoosh and they will be stored in a directory called 'myIndex' (the file was too large to upload even compressed). Then you will need to move that directory out of WebScraper.

## Running the project

#### Run in a virtual environment in main directory
``` . venv/bin/activate ```

#### Tell flask where app is
