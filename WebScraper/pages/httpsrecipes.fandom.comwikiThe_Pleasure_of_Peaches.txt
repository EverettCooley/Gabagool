A peach is an all-in-one marvel. The scent is light and sweet, the skin is fuzzy and smooth, and the taste - oh, the juice with each bite just drizzles down and the natural flavor penetrates each slice. It is a favorite just plain, cool and succulent - but have a napkin nearby to catch the essence of peach that drips down your chin. The color is the hue of a sunlit morning and the sound of your teeth cutting through the flesh just gets your taste buds ready for an authentic taste of summer. If you want something a bit more fanciful than a plain peach - try some of these:
 
 Fresh Peach Torte 
 Peach Sauce 
 Baked Peaches 
 Try peach ice cream or ice milk, stewed peaches or add peaches, first dipped in lemon juice to prevent darkening in your favorite fruit salad. Place peeled fresh peach slices on cottage cheese or with watercress and drizzle with French dressing. Use fresh peaches on ham or even in scrambled eggs. Fresh peaches are a summertime treat - use your imagination and give them a try. ENJOY! Â©Arleen M. Kaptur 2002
