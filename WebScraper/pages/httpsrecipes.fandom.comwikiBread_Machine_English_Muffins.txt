File:Placeholder 
 Prep Time: 
 Cook time: 
 Serves: 8 muffins 
 
 Description : 
 These freeze well and can be reheated in the microwave or toasted.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup water 
 3 tablespoons  butter 
 1  egg 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 3¼ cups  all-purpose flour  (or more) 
 1½ teaspoons  dry yeast 
 corn meal  (not  corn starch ) 
 Directions : 
 Put ingredients in the machine in the order listed. 
 Start the dough cycle. 
 When the cycle is finished (the dough should be soft but not sticky). 
 Sprinkle corn meal over your work area. 
 Use your hands to pat the dough into a ½ inch thick rectangle. 
 Turn the dough so that each side gets lightly coated with cornmeal. 
 Cut into 8 rounds (a large scone cutter or a large can works well) 
 When you run out of dough gather up the trimmings and cut more rounds. Place the rounds on a baking sheet, cover and let rise for 20- 30 minutes--until not quite double. 
 Heat a dry cast iron skillet or griddle over a low flame (can use some non stick spay). 
 Cook the muffins about 5 to 7 minutes on each side. 
 They should be golden brown when you turn them. 
 Split the muffins with a fork or serrated knife and serve warm. 
 Notes : 
 Instead of using cutter divide it into eight equal pieces and pat each piece into a ½" thick round. Then, turn each round in dish of corn meal.
