      Whey     
 The watery liquid that separates from the solids (curds) in  cheese  making. Whey is sometimes further processed into  whey cheese . It can be separated another step, with butter being made from the fattier share. Whey is also used in processed foods such as crackers. Primarily, however, whey is more often used as livestock feed than it is in the human diet.
