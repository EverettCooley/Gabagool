       Blue Cheese Chips     
 Ingredients : 
 ½ lb (8 ounces)  blue cheese , broken into small pieces 
 8 tbsp (1 stick)  butter  or  margarine , softened 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour  or  rice flour 
 ¼ cup  buckwheat groats  or chopped toasted  nuts  of your choice 
 ¼ tsp  pepper 
 ¼ cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Cream the  butter  and  cheese  together 
 Stir together the flour,  buckwheat groats  or  nuts  and  pepper . 
 Add the  flour  mixture to the butter- cheese  mixture and blend well. 
 Blend in the  milk , little by little, to form a dough that will hold together in a ball. 
 The dough should be quite stiff. 
 Divide it into 2 equal portions for rolling. 
 On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to about 3/16 inch thick. 
 Cut into 1½-inch circles and place on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure the edges do not touch. 
 Prick each cracker in 1 or 2 places with the tines of a fork. 
 Bake for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until medium brown.
