Ingredients : 
 3 oz of unsweetened (Baker's)  chocolate , lightly chopped 
 1½ cups semi-sweet vegan  chocolate chips , halved 
 1 cup  unbleached white flour 
 ½ tsp  baking soda 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 4 tbsp  soy milk  whipped with 2 tbsp  corn  or  potato starch 
 2 cups  brown sugar 
 ⅔ cup  soy milk 
 ½ cup melted  margarine 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 In a double boiler (or, a small pot supported by some stacked silverware inside a large water-filled skillet, like me) melt the unsweetened chocolate and the first half of the chocolate chips together until smooth. 
 Remove from heat and let cool slightly. 
 Melt the margarine in a small pan and let cool slightly. 
 In a large bowl mix the flour, baking soda and salt thoroughly. 
 Make a well in the centre of these ingredients and set aside. 
 Preheat your oven to 350°F. 
 In a second bowl, whip 4 tbsp of soy milk with the starch. 
 Add the brown sugar, the rest of the soy milk, the melted chocolate, the melted margarine and the vanilla, and beat on a medium speed until it is all thoroughly combined. 
 Pour this into the well in the dry ingredients and mix lightly and quickly until just moistened. 
 Fold in the remaining half of the chocolate chips. 
 Fill prepared muffin tins (either oiled or lined with paper cups) ⅔rds full, and bake 25 – 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of one comes up clean.
