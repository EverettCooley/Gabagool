Ingredients : 
 2 large eggs 
 1 oz. water 
 Â¼ tsp. baking powder 
 1 Tbsp. butter (or olive oil) 
 Directions : 
 Crack eggs into a bowl and add the water and baking powder. 
 With a whisk, vigorously whip the eggs until frothy. 
 Use a Teflon coated omelet pan. Heat pan with 1 Tbsp. butter (or olive oil) until it is very hot, but not smoking. 
 Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Spread the mixture around quickly and then lift off the heat to avoid burning. The omelet should bubble up, then thicken slightly and brown on the bottom. 
 Flip the omelet (trying to keep it in one piece) and lightly brown the other side. Remove to a serving dish while folding into quarters.
