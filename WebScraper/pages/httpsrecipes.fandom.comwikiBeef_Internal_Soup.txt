 Description : 
 Check dried  codfish  for saltiness. If very salty it may need to be soaked overnight, in which case eliminate  salt  from recipe.
 Liberian soups are unlike most soup dishes and are often a combination of meats, fish, and vegetables ultimately combined in one pot. With less  water  they may be served as main dishes. Other vegetables such as  okra  and  string beans  may be added.
