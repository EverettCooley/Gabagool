 Original recipe 
 Serves 4 – 6 
 Ingredients : 
 2  shallots , thinly sliced 
 2 tablespoons  red wine vinegar 
 1 cup cubed  mozzarella 
 2 tablespoons fresh chopped herbs ( basil ,  tarragon ,  oregano , and  parsley ) 
 ¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 pound  fresh beans  any kind or a combination of green and  yellow types 
 1 cup halved  cherry tomatoes 
 Directions : 
 In a medium-size bowl, toss the shallots with vinegar. 
 Add cubed mozzarella, herbs and oil. 
 Toss well to coat, season with salt and pepper and marinate for a few hours or overnight to let flavors blend. 
 Bring a medium-size pot of water to a boil and add ½ teaspoon salt. 
 Drop in the beans and cook until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes for small young beans and up to 6 minutes for larger beans. 
 Drain. 
 Toss the hot beans with the olive oil, shallots, tarragon, ½ teaspoon salt and pepper. 
 The beans will soak up the flavors as they cool to room temperature. 
 Toss in the cherry tomatoes. 
 Season and drizzle with additional oil and vinegar if desired.
