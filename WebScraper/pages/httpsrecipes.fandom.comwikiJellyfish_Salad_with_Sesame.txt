 How to Make Cold Jellyfish Salad on eHow.com 
 Ingredients : 
 Â½ lb  jellyfish , shredded 
 3 tbsp  sesame oil 
 3 tbsp toasted white  sesame seeds 
 2 tsp  soy sauce 
 2 tsp white  rice vinegar 
 2 tsp  sugar 
 Directions : 
 The jellyfish comes dried so you need to rinse jellyfish well in cold running water, then drain to get rid of excess salt and to make sure it is clean. 
 Then put it in a large heat resistant bowl and cover with boiling water. 
 Leave your jellyfish in the water until tender (about fifteen or twenty minutes). 
 Once tender, drain the hot water and again rinse the jellyfish in cold water, six or seven more times. 
 Drain and pat dry with paper towels. 
 Now, in a large bowl mix the 3 tbsp sesame oil, 2 tsp of soy sauce, 2 tsp white rice vinegar and 2 tsp of sugar in a small bowl. 
 Put the jellyfish in the bowl with the other ingredients and ensure that it is well covered with the mixture. 
 Let set for at least thirty minutes before serving. 
 To serve garnish with the toasted sesame seeds. 
 Serves 2 as a main entree. Enjoy.
