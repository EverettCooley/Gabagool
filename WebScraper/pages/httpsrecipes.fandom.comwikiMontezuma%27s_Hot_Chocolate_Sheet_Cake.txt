 Add the remaining  sweetened condensed milk ; stir in confectioners  Sugar . 
 Spread on the warm cake. 
 Serve warm with  vanilla  icecream. Enjoy! 
 Note: If the icing is too thin for your taste, it's simple to add more  cocoa  or confectioners  Sugar  until you reach the consistancy wanted. 
 Or, if it's too thick just add a bit of  milk . 
 Also, if you decide to do away with the  coffee  (in the cake or the icing), just replace it with  cocoa . :D.
