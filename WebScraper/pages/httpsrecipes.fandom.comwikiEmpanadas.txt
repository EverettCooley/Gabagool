      Empanadas     
 Ingredients : 
 5 cups  flour  (unsifted) 
 1 tablespoon  baking powder 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 1 cup  shortening  (Crisco preferred) 
 1 cup  milk 
 Filling : 
 2 lbs  ground beef 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  onion powder 
 1 teaspoon  garlic powder 
 1 teaspoon  chili powder 
 1 tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce 
 1 to 2 tablespoons  tomato paste 
 hot sauce  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Mix  flour ,  salt , and  baking powder  together in a bowl. 
 Cut in  shortening  until it resembles crumbly meal. 
 Gradually sprinkle in  milk  stirring until dough clings together. 
 Knead 10 times. 
 Let rest ½ hour. 
 Mix ground  beef  with all the ingredients except  tomato paste . 
 Fry slowly in 1 tablespoon  oil  until cooked. 
 Mash around a bit so it's crumbly. 
 Add 1 to 2 tablespoons  tomato  paste (so that it's thick), stir very well. 
 Turn off heat and let filling cool. 
 Add as much hot sauce as you like. 
 On a very well-floured surface, roll dough as thick as you would for pie crust (can divide it into 2 parts if desired). 
 Cut 5" circles (using any container with 5" opening) and place filling on center of each circle. 
 Brush beaten  egg  on lower edge of circles. 
 Fold over and press edges with fork dipped in  flour . 
 Fry in  lard  about 2 minutes on each side until brown. 
 Make sure there is enough  lard  to cover the empanadas — about 3 – 4" deep. 
 Can be frozen unfried. 
 Stack between wax paper, sprinkling plenty of  flour  in between empanadas and wax paper, or they will stick together.
