 About green olives : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Green olives on Wikipedia 
 Green olives are the small fruits of the trees that are native to Mediterranean Europe. Picked in their unripened state and then cured, green olives are generally more sharp tasting than the ripe, black olives. Pitted olives are even occasionally stuffed with the strips of pickled red pimientos. Quality Italian green olives are sold in well-stocked food stores. Green olives are sold by the pound and in bottles or cans.
