 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoon  oil 
 1  Onion 
 1 clove of  garlic  (crushed) 
 1/2 inch piece of  ginger 
 1 teaspoon coriander 
 1 leveled teaspoon  chili powder 
 1 lb  Chicken  legs 
 500 grams tin of  spinach  puree 
 2 teaspoon  milk 
 1 leveled teaspoon  salt 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Heat the cooking  oil  in a pan. Add chopped  Onion  and fry it until golden brown. Now add  ginger , coriander,  chili powder ,  garlic  and  salt . Fry this mixture for 10 minutes and keep it stirring every two minutes. Fry both sides of  Chicken  legs in this  masala  until brown and add the  spinach , cover the pan with a lid and leave it on a gentle heat for 25 minutes. When the  water  has been absorbed, add 2 teaspoon of  milk  and let it cook for further 5 minutes. 
Serve with Boiled  rice  
Tip: I always pour some  water  over the  spinach  to wash the preservatives off before adding it to the  Chicken  legs, and then leave it to drain all the  water  for few minutes. It also gets rid of the extra  salt .
