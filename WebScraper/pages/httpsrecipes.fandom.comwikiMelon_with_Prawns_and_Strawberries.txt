Description : 
 Cook's notes: when  melons  are ripe they should "give" slightly when pressed at the stalk end. wrap up  Melons  well if storing them in the refrigerator as otherwise they will permeate everything around them with their heady scent.
 
 Preparation time: 20 minutes 
 Freezing: not recommended 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ medium-size  avocado 
 ½ tsp  lemon juice 
 1 medium-size, ripe seasonal  melon  (i.e.  ogen ,  cantaloupe  or  honeydew ) 
 1  celery  heart, chopped 
 4 oz  strawberries , hulled and sliced 
 8 oz cooked, peeled  prawns  (thawed if frozen) 
 2 little gem  lettuces , rinsed and torn into pieces 
 Dressing : 
 8 oz  strawberries 
 1 tsp  caster sugar 
 2 tsp  olive oil 
 1 tbsp unsweetened  orange juice 
 2 tsp chopped fresh  parsley 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Peel and chop the  avocado  and place it in a mixing bowl. 
 Sprinkle it with the  lemon juice  to prevent it from discolouring. 
 Halve the  melon , discard the seeds and scoop out the flesh using a melon baller (or cut it into cubes). 
 Gently combine the  melon , chopped  celery ,  strawberries  and prawns with the  avocado  and refrigerate until needed.
