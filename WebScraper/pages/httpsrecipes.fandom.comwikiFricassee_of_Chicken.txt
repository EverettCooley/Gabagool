Description : 
 From  The Evening Sun , August 29, 1990
 
 Makes four servings of 170 calories each. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lbs boneless, skinless  chicken breasts , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 3  plum tomatoes , peeled and chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , thinly sliced 
 ¼ cup minced  leeks 
 2 tbsp  chicken stock 
 3  bay leaves 
 1 tsp  olive oil 
 2 tbsp minced fresh  basil 
 1 tbsp  light cream  or  milk 
 Directions : 
 Place the  chicken  in a 9-inch glass pie dish and cover with vented plastic wrap. 
 Microcook on high until the  chicken  is cooked through, about 4½ to 5 minutes, stopping to stir midway. 
 Remove the  chicken  with a slotted spoon and drain off any liquid. 
 Combine the  tomatoes ,  garlic ,  leeks , stock,  bay leaves , and  oil  in the same dish. 
 Cover with vented plastic wrap and microcook on high for 2 to 2½ minutes, stirring once midway. 
 Immediately stir in the  basil  and  cream  or  milk  and let stand for about 4 minutes. 
 Remove the  bay leaves  and serve hot in shallow bowls. 
 Note: at this time the sauce (everything but the  chicken  and  bay leaves ) can be whirled for a few seconds in a blender before being poured over the  chicken . This isn't necessary, but it does make a more attractive, blended sauce.
