 About Pollack : 
 Pollack is a common name for some species in the Pollachius genus. Some names include the Atlantic pollack, European pollack, pollock and lieu jaune, such as Boston blues, coalfish or coaley, or saithe. These species can grow from 3 ft up to 6, meaning 1.07 m and can have a weight of 21 kg. Being an ocean fish, pollack has a strongly-defined silvery lateral line running down the sides. It has a greenish black colour above the lateral line and white belly. Generally it is found in waters up to 180 m deep over rocks and anywhere in the water column, from North Carolina up to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Pollack are an important part of the North Atlantic and New England fisheries and they spawn in late winter and early spring on Georges Bank, off the New England coast. Other types of Pollack include the Alaska Pollack which is called walleye pollack or Theragra chalcogramma and the Norwegian pollack or Theragra finnmarchica.
 This member of the Cod family is found in the North Atlantic. The low- to moderate-fat flesh is white, firm and has a delicate, slightly sweet flavor. The pollock can reach about 35 pounds but is normally found in markets between 4 and 10 pounds. It's available fresh, frozen and smoked, either whole or in fillets or steaks. Pollock may be prepared in any way suitable for cod. It's often used to make surimi, which is now commonly available.
