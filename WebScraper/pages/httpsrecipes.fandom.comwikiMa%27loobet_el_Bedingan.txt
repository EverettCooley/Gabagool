 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 vegetable oil 
 2  onions  chopped 
 1 pound  Lamb  or  Beef  cubes 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon  allspice 
 2 pounds  Eggplant , sliced into 1/3" thick slices 
 2 cups long  grain   rice 
 1/2 cup toasted  pine nuts  for garnish (optional) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a large pan or skillet, fry the  onions  in 3 tablespoons of the  oil  over low heat, with the lid on, until softened and golden in color. Add the meat and brown it all over. Cover with  water , add the  salt ,  pepper ,  cinnamon ,  allspice  and cook until tender, for about one hour. Be sure to add  water  as necessary to keep the meat covered. 
 While the meat is cooking, arrange the  Eggplant  slices on a baking sheet, brushing both sides generously with  oil  and lightly seasoning with  salt . Broil under a pre-heated broiler, turning once, until the slices are lightly browned on both sides.. 
 Remove the pan with the meat from the heat and add a layer of  Eggplant  slices on top. Pour half of the  rice  evenly over those layers, and season with  salt . Add a second layer of  Eggplant  slices, then cover with the remaining  rice . Sprinkle with a little  salt  ( if desired) and add just enough  water  to cover the  rice . Do Not Stir. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil, then simmer on the lowest possible heat for about 20 minutes or until the  rice  is tender. Add  water  if the casserole becomes too dry. Let rest, but keep warm for 20 minutes before serving.
