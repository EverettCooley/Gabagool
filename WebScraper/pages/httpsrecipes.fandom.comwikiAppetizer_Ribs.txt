Appetizer Ribs
 3 to 4 lbs. spareribs, cut into individual ribs (if possible, ask the butcher to cut each rib in half, crosswise, so they will be a more convenient size to handle as an appetizer)
Salt and pepper
2 cups water
Garlic salt
1 bottle Russian salad dressing (8 oz)
1 can pineapple juice (6 oz)
 Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper. Place in slow cooker; pour water over them. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 7 hours or until tender. Drain. arrange ribs on broiler pan; sprinkle with garlic salt. Make sauce by combining salad dressing and pineapple juice. Brush ribs with half the sauce. Broil until brown; turn, brush other side and brown. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.
