 Wikipedia Article  About Limburger on Wikipedia 
 Limburger is an aged cheese made from cows' milk. It has a rind that is usually somewhat mottled in appearance, the color ranging from white and yellow to brown, and a paler, softer interior. It has a strong odor and is often eaten with other strong flavored food and drink. The taste can vary from pungent to mild.
 Limburger cheese originated in Limburg, Belgium It is also made in the United States and Germany.
 It is illegal to manufacture this cheese in Wisconsin without a master cheesemaker's certification. Currently only one factory, Chalet cheese factory in Monroe, Wisconsin, produces Limburger in the US.
 Undoubtedly the stinkiest of the strong-smelling cheeses, Limburger has a rind that ranges in color from yellow to reddish-brown and a yellow, pasty interior. This strong, pungently flavored cheese is made from cow's milk and is soft ripened for about 3 months. Though it originated in Belgium and is now also made in the United States, most Limburger comes from Germany. The imports continue to ripen during transit, however, and often arrive devastatingly odorous. Though it's definitely categorized among those foods that are an acquired taste, Limburger has legions of fans. It's best served with full-flavored food and drink such as onions, dark breads and dark beer.
