Chocolate Raspberry Icebox Cake
 
 ====Ingredients=== : 
 1/3 cup chilled heavy cream 
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
 1/8 teaspoon vanilla 
 5 chocolate wafers such as Nabisco Famous 
 1/3 cup fresh raspberries 
 Garnish: grated bittersweet chocolate (not 
 unsweetened) 
 
 === Directions ==== : 
 Beat cream with sugar and vanilla in a small deep bowl
with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff
peaks.
 Spread 1 heaping teaspoon cream onto each of 4 wafers.
Arrange enough raspberries side by side (as close
together as possible) on 1 cream-topped wafer to form
an even layer. Stack 2 cream-topped wafers on a plate
(cream sides up) and top with berry wafer, then
carefully spread another teaspoon cream over berries.
Top with last cream wafer and cover cream with
remaining plain wafer. Frost top and sides of cake
with remaining cream. Cover with an inverted bowl and
chill at least 4 hours.
 Serve cake with remaining berries. 
 Yield: 1 servings
