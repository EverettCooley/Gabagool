Description : 
 After an OVERLY hearty, boring, rich, oily meat and  potatoes  kind of meal everyone only wants one thing; something that's not overly hearty, boring, rich, or oily! That is why I made dessert salad that is also a great snack, bunch, and even a full lunch sometimes.8 servings, 30 minutes preparation
