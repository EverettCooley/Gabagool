Description : 
 The secret of tender pot roasts lies in keeping the heat below the boil. Violent boiling toughens meat fibers. Cooking ahead allows you to chill the meat and remove the fat on the surface; chilled meat is also easy to slice.

 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  flour 
 1½ tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp freshly ground  pepper 
 4 – 5 lbs boneless  chuck  or  rump  roast 
 3 tbsp  shortening  or  vegetable oil 
 1  onion , sliced 
 2 tsp  thyme , crumbled 
 1 cup  tomato juice 
 ¼ – ½ tsp  tabasco 
 Directions : 
 Combine the flour, salt, and pepper. 
 Rub it all over the roast. 
 Melt the shortening in a heavy casserole with a lid or in a dutch oven. 
 When the shortening is hot, add the roast and brown it to a deep rich color on all sides. 
 Lower the heat and add the onion, thyme, tomato juice, and tabasco. 
 Cover and simmer for 3 to 3½ hours, turning once or twice during the cooking. 
 When fork-tender, cool. 
 Remove the fat, slice the meat, and reheat in the degreased sauce, or skim off the fat, reheat, and bring to the table to carve.
