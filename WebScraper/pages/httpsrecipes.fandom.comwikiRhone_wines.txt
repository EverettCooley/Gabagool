The northern part of the region contains many great individual Appellations including Cote, Rotie, Condrieu, Chateau Grillet, Saint-Joseph and Hermitage. The dominant grapes here are Syrah for red wines and Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier for whites. The most famous appellation in the south is Chateauneuf-Du-Pape.

The white grapes used include Bourboulenc, Clairette, Marsanne, Muscardine, Picardan, Roussanne and Piquepoul (or Picpoule).
