 Contributed by  World Recipes Y-Group 
 
 Ingredients : 
 Vegetables : 
 2 quarts shredded  cabbage 
 ½ cup  sweet onions , chopped fine 
 ½ cup chopped  green  or  red bell peppers  (optional) 
 2 tbsp  salt 
 Vinegar-sugar-spice mixture : 
 2 cups  vinegar 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 2 tsp  dry mustard 
 1 tsp  turmeric 
 ½ tsp ground  ginger 
 2 tsp  celery seeds 
 2 tsp  mustard seed 
 Directions : 
 Vegetables : 
 Combine chopped vegetables and sprinkle with salt. 
 Let stand 4 to 6 hours in the refrigerator. 
 Drain well. 
 Combine the following ingredients and simmer 10 minutes. 
 Use a pot large enough to put the vegetable mix in later. 
 Vinegar-sugar-spice mixture : 
 Add vegetables to vinegar-sugar-spice mixture and simmer another 10 minutes. 
 Bring to a boil. 
 Then pack, boiling hot, into clean, heated canning jars, leaving only a ⅛ inch head space. 
 Place canning lids and rings on jars and tighten. 
 I usually turn the jars upside down so that all the heat is on the seals.
