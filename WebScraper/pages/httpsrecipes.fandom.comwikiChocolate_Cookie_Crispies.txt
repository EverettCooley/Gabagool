Description : 
 Another cereal and cake mix recipe from from the Kraft and Post cereal websites. 
 
 21 minutes | 10 minutes prep 
 36 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1 (18.25 ounces) box chocolate  cake mix 
 ½ cup  vegetable oil 
 ¼ cup  water 
 1  egg 
 3 cups Cocoa Pebbles cereal (I bet Cocoa Krispies would also work fine) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Beat cake mix,  oil ,  water  and  egg  in large bowl until well blended. 
 Add cereal; mix well. 
 Drop tablespoonfuls of dough, 2 inches apart, onto ungreased baking sheets. 
 Bake 11 minutes or just until cookies begin to brown (this may be hard to see since the cookies are dark in color, so watch carefully). 
 Cool on wire racks.
