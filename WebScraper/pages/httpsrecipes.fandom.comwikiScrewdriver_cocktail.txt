 About screwdriver cocktail : 
 A mixed drink of  orange juice  and  vodka  served over ice. Its origins are just unknown, but the most popular tale is that it was named in the 1950s by American oil-rig workers stationed in the Middle East who opened and stiffed cans of this mixture with their screwdrivers.
