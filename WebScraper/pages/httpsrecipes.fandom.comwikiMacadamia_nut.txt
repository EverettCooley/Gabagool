 Wikipedia Article  About Macadamia nut on Wikipedia 
 Rich, cream-colored, round nuts now raised primarily in Hawaii. Generally used in baked goods or served, salted, as a snack, they are high in fat and expensive. The macadamia tree is native to Australia and is named for John McAdam, the scientist who first cultivated it.
 A round, hard-shelled nut that has a rich coconut-like flavour and crisp texture. It originated in Queensland, Australia but is also grown in Central America and Hawaii. The nuts can be purchased shelled or unshelled, raw or dry roasted, and salted or unsalted. The macadamia nut's best nutritional value is that it contains no cholesterol and is low in saturated fats and sodium. The monounsaturated fat (the good fat) content is over 80% of the total fat contained in the nut, which is more than that contained in olive oil.
