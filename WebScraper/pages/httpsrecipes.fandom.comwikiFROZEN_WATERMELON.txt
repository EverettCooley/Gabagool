FROZEN WATERMELON
 
 ~*~*~*~*~*~ *~*~*~*~* 
 INGREDIENTS:
3 pints vanilla ice cream, slightly softened
3 pints raspberry sherbet, softened
1/2 cup (3 ounces) miniature semisweet chocolate chips
14 drops green food color
2 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed
 DIRECTIONS:
Line an 8-cup mold or mixing bowl completely with aluminum
foil. Working quickly, spread the vanilla ice cream 1 inch
thick over the bottom and sides of the bowl. (It'll probably
slide down the sides a bit.) Immediately place in the freezer
and freeze for about 1 hour. When the ice cream has become
somewhat hard, but not frozen solid, spread it all the way
up the sides to the top of the bowl; then replace it in the
freezer for about 1 hour, until firm. Place the raspberry
sherbet in a medium-sized bowl and add the chocolate chips;
blend until evenly mixed. Place in the vanilla ice cream-
lined bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight,
or until completely hard. When ready to serve, in a small
bowl, mix the green food color with the whipped topping until
evenly blended. Remove the mold from the freezer, remove the
plastic wrap, and invert onto a platter larger than the mold.
Remove the mold and peel off the foil. Spread the whipped
topping evenly over the ice cream and serve immediately, or
freeze until the topping is firm, then cover and keep frozen
until ready to serve. Cut into wedges, just like fresh
watermelon.
 Yield: 10-12 Servings
