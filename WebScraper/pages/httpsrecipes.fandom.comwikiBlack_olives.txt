 About Black olives : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Black Olives on Wikipedia 
 Black olives are the ripe, small fruits of trees that are native to Mediterranean Europe. Ripe black olives such as French Niçoise, Greek Kalamata, or Italian Gaeta varieties are cured in salt, seasonings, brines, vinegars, and oils and have a pungent flavor. Moroccan olives are ripe fruits that have first been dried in the sun, then packed in oil. Large pitted black olives are available canned. Cured black olives are sold by the pound and in bottles or cans.
