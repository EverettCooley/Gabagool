Description : 
       French Chocolate Almond Cake with strawberries     
 This is something I dug out of my recipe book. After making it I will treat this more of a souffle type dish as you have to make sure it doesn't 'fall' during cooking. Do not open the oven until necessary and no running or undue noise whilst baking. As you can tell from my picture, mine did fall but it tastes heavenly! Mental note: must work on presentation.
