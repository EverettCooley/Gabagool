 Description : 
 This is a recipe that I played around with and perfected in 1982. I had all of these ingredients on hand and wanted to come up with a unique dessert using fresh  peaches  from my overloaded  peach  tree. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 ounces  cream cheese , softened 
 2 teaspoons  peach  preserves 
 8 ounce can  pineapple  tidbits in their own juice, drained 
 6  maraschino cherries , halved 
 1/8 cup fresh  blackberries 
 2 large  peaches , halved, pitted 
 1 tablespoon chopped  pecans 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl combine  cream cheese  and preserves. 
 Blend well. Stir in  pineapple ,  cherries  and  blackberries . 
 Slice a small portion from the base of each  peach  half so that the fruit sits flat. 
 Reserve  peach  slices. 
 Arrange  peach  halves on serving plates. 
 Spoon 1/4 of  pineapple  mixture into each  peach  half and sprinkle with  pecans . 
 Garnish each with reserved  peach  slices and  mint  leaves.
