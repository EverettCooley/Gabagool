Ingredients : 
 1  eggplant  sliced ½" thick 
 1 sliced  tomato 
 basil  to taste 
 low-sodium  tamari  to taste 
 balsamic vinegar  to taste 
 red bell pepper , sliced to taste 
 Directions : 
 Bake  eggplant  on a baking sheet at 400°F for about 8 – 10 minutes. 
 When I turned the slices over and topped them with  basil  and sliced  tomato  like the recipe said, I brushed them with a mixture of low-sodium tamari and  balsamic vinegar . 
 I added some pieces of red pepper at this time, too, and brushed them with the mixture. 
 Eight minutes or so more in the oven, and it was yummy!
