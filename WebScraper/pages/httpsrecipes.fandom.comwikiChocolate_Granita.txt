 Description : 
 This is a refreshing treat, perfect for the Spring and Summer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups  water 
 2/3 cup  Sugar 
 1 cup unsweetened  cocoa 
 Fresh  mint  sprigs, for garnish 
 whipped cream , optional 
 Directions : 
 In a medium saucepan, combine first three ingredients. Cook over medium-low heat just until mixture starts to bubble at edges. Cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, about one minute. Cool.
 
 Freeze as directed below. Spoon into serving dishes, garnish with  mint  and  whipped cream  if desired, and serve immediately.
 
 
 Recommended technique : 
 Classic Granita Method: : 
 Pour the granita mixture into a wide and shallow container, such as a stainless steel baking dish (the shallower the container, the quicker the granita will freeze).
 
 Cover with a lid, foil or plastic wrap. Freeze the mixture 1 to 2 hours, until it is solid around the edges. Take the container out of the freezer and scrape the  ice  with a fork, mixing it from the edges into the center.
 
 Repeat this scraping and mixing process every 30 minutes or so (at least three times) until the entire mixture has turned into small, sequined  ice  flakes. When ready to serve, "rake" with a fork to loosen the granita and spoon into serving dishes.
 
 
 Quick Granita Method: : 
 Note: This method is faster, but the granita will have a different textureâ€”less icy and more slushy.
 
 Pour the granita mixture into  ice  trays, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to freeze solid. Process the cubes in a food processor when you're ready to serve.
