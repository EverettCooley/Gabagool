Description : 
 Literally translated as "peppernuts", these small, crisp, pepper (spice) cookies are a family treat at Christmas. While some recipes call for black or white pepper, this recipe does not. They are better baked a month or two in advance and stored in cans or jars, and can be frozen for long periods of time.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  sugar 
 1 cup  butter   or   shortening 
 2  eggs  well beaten 
 ½ cup  light corn syrup 
 ½ cup  molasses 
 ⅓ cup  water 
 6⅔ cup sifted  flour 
 1 tsp  cinnamon 
 ¼ tsp  allspice 
 ½ tsp  anise seed  (crushed or ground) 
 ¼ tsp  cloves 
 ½ tsp  nutmeg 
 ½ tsp  soda 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, sift all dry ingredients except anise seed together; sprinkle in crushed/ground anise seed and set dry ingredients aside. 
 In a second large bowl, blend sugar and butter until smooth. 
 Add eggs, syrup, molasses and water, blending until thoroughly mixed (it may appear separated, but will come together when dry ingredients are added). 
 Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, about ⅓ at a time, making sure to thoroughly blend after each addition. 
 Roll into several long slender rolls ½ inch in diameter. 
 Chill for about 2 hours, but can be overnight. 
 Cut in ⅓ inch pieces, and bake on ungreased cookie sheets in 400°F oven, about 5 – 7 minutes till just lightly brown. 
 Remove from cookie sheet immediately and cool completely.
