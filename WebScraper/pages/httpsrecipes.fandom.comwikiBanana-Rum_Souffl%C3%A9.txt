 Ingredients : 
 1 teaspoon softened unsalted  butter 
 2 tablespoons granulated  sugar , plus additional for dusting 
 3 large ripe  bananas , peeled and sliced 
 ¼ cup dark  brown sugar 
 Juice of ½  lemon 
 2 tablespoons dark  rum 
 5 large  egg whites 
 Pinch fine  salt 
 Cocoa powder  for dusting, optional 
 Directions : 
 Lightly butter the insides of 4 (1-cup) ramekins, then dust with sugar. Space them evenly on a baking sheet and put in the freezer. 
 Put the bananas, brown sugar, lemon juice, and rum in a medium saucepan. Cook uncovered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the bananas begin to soften, about 7 minutes. 
 Mash the bananas with a potato masher or large fork until mostly smooth; continue cooking to make a thick purée, about 8 more minutes. Cool to room temperature. 
 Position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425 °F. 
 Whip the egg whites and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until foamy. Increase the speed to high, gradually pour in the 2 tablespoons sugar, and whip until the whites hold soft peaks. 
 Fold a quarter of the whites into the banana mixture and then fold in the remaining whites. (Don't dally here; timing is everything with soufflés. Whip, fold, and get the souffle in the oven without missing a beat.) 
 Evenly divide the batter among the prepared ramekins. 
 Bake the soufflés until well puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. 
 Dust with a light sprinkling of cocoa powder, if desired. 
 Serve immediately.
