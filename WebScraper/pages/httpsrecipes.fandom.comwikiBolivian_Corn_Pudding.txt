 Directions : 
 corn  pudding is popular throughout South America, where it is often baked in  corn  husks in the style of a tamale. Here's a simpler version made in a baking dish. For best results, use fresh  corn  kernels. 
 Preheat oven to 400 F. Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray. 
 In food processor or blender, combine 3 cups  corn  and  milk . Puree until smooth. In large bowl, combine  cornmeal , scallions,  raisins , 1 tablespoon  Sugar , 1 teaspoon  paprika , 1 teaspoon  salt ,  baking powder ,  cinnamon ,  anise  seeds, 1/4 teaspoon  pepper , and remaining 1 cup  corn . Stir to mix. Stir in pureed  corn . Taste and add more  Sugar ,  salt  and  pepper  if desired. 
 In another large bowl, combine  egg  whites and  cream of tartar . Beat with electric mixer until firm and glossy but not dry, about 8 minutes. (Begin beating on low speed and gradually increase the speed to medium, then to high). Gently fold  corn  mixture into  egg  whites. Spoon mixture into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with  Muenster  and remaining  paprika . 
 Bake until puffed and golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly.
