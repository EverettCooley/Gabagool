 Description : 
 This special Ramadan dish will remind you of Gyros (Döner) with  yogurt  and is so easy to prepare. You can start making this, 30 minutes before dinner. Use of  garlic  is one the best ways to make you want to drink  water , which restores the liquid in a body from which a fasting person refrains during the day.
