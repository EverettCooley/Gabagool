Description : 
 Homemade bacon is easy enough to make at home: all you need are thin pork belly slices and a couple of pantry staples. It's perfect with  atsara  and heaps of steaming rice! 
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups water, lukewarm or regular only 
 1 cup  white vinegar 
 1 teaspoon ground black pepper]] 
 ½ tablespoon  salt 
 ½ cup minced  garlic 
 1 kilo  Pork belly   or  (2 ½ kilos sliced, boneless pork belly) 
 cooking oil 
 Directions : 
 In a small, fresh bowl, combine water, vinegar, pepper, salt, and garlic. Stir until salt is completely dissolved. Set aside. 
 Arrange pork slices lengthwise in a large plastic storage container and pour the vinegar marinade over them. Just leave in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or overnight. 
 When ready to cook, drain marinade and place pork strips in a colander or sieve to let the rest of the marinade drip off. Pat dry with paper towels to remove more excess liquid. 
 Heat oil in a large frying pan. Fry the pork strips until golden brown and crunchy at the edges. 
 Blot the fried pork strips with paper towels to remove excess oil. Just serve while hot.
