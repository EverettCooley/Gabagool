 About Graham crackers : 
 Graham crackers are crisp, sweet, flat cookies made from coarsely ground whole-wheat flour and usually honey, and named after 19th-century American nutritionist Sylvester Graham who touted them as a health food in the 1830s. They are eaten out of hand or are crumbled or crushed and used to add texture and subtle sweetness to batters, crusts, and toppings. Once opened, packages of crackers should be rewrapped tightly and stored in a cool, dry place.
