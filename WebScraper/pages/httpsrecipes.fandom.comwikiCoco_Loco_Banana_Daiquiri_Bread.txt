 Description : 
 A moist, luscious  banana  bread with a touch of coconutty Malibu  rum  and a sprinkling of shredded  coconut  within! The original recipe is from the  Sugar  In The Raw website, but I changed it to add the Malibu  rum , shredded  coconut  and  allspice . As always, be sure that the  bananas  are REALLY ripe - the skins almost need to be black - and do not overmix the batter.

 1 1/4 cups  Sugar  in the raw raw  Sugar 
 1/4 cup  butter , melted
