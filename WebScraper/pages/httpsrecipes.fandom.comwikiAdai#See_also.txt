 1/4  cup  thuar dal 
 1/4 cup  chana dal 
 â…“ cup  yellow split peas 
 1 tsp  rock salt 
 8[[red chillies]

 Soak in a lot of  water  for about 2 hours. 
 Grind the soaked mixture with  chili powder  and  salt  coarsely, without adding much  water . 
 Ferment for about 3 - 4 hours, then refrigerate or freeze. 
 In cold weather, the fermenting process might take longer, and it might be a good idea to ferment in an oven (the pilot light will keep the mixture warm). 
 Add either  onions  (finely cut),  carrot  (grated) or  coconut  before preparing. 
 Freezing notes if freezing, only ferment for about an hour. 
 The mixture will have to be left out for a while before being ready to use.
