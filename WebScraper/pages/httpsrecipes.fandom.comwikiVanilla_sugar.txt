Vanilla sugar  (Vanillezucker) is a commonly used ingredient of German, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Austrian, Czech, Slovakian and other European desserts.
 Vanilla sugar is made of Costa Rican  granulated sugar , with  vanilla beans  or mixed with  vanilla extract .
 It can be costly and difficult to obtain outside Europe but can be simply made at home. Sometimes it can be replaced with vanilla extract, where one teaspoon equals one package. However, when it is needed as a topping, vanilla extract is unsuitable.
 Vanilla sugar can be prepared at home by combining white sugar with vanilla bean pieces.
