 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 teaspoons  dry yeast 
 1½ tablespoons  Sugar 
 about ¾ cup warm  water  (or more) 
 3 1/3 cups  flour 
 1½ teaspoons  salt 
 1  egg 
 2 tablespoons  Peanut  or  sunflower oil , plus more to grease the dough 
 2 tablespoons  anise seed 
 1  egg   yolk  to glaze bread 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve the  yeast  and ½ teaspoon of the  Sugar  in ½ cup of 
 warm  water . Add about a cup of the  flour  and stir vigorously until smooth. Leave this sponge-batter for 30 minutes until doubled in bulk. Put the remaining  flour  in a large bowl, add the rest of the ingredients except the one  egg   yolk , and mix will. Add the risen sponge. Work it with your hands and add enough warm  water  to make soft dough that holds together as a ball. Knead for 10 minutes until very soft and elastic. Pour ½ tablespoon of  oil  in the bowl and roll the dough around to grease it all over. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 1½ hours or until doubled in bulk. Punch down the dough, divide into 6 balls, and place at a distance form each other on a baking sheet, on parchment paper. Leave covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to allow the dough to rise again. Brush the tops with  egg   yolk  mixed with 1 teaspoon of  water  and bake in a preheated 400 °F oven for 30 – 40 minutes until browned on top. Tap the bottom of a roll. If it sounds hollow, it's done. Cool on rack
