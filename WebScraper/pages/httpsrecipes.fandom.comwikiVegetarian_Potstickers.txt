Description : 
 Serves 4 to 6
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ pound  firm tofu 
 ½ cup finely shredded  carrot 
 ½ cup finely chopped  bok choy 
 ¼ cup finely chopped  water chestnuts 
 ¼ cup finely chopped  bamboo shoots 
 ¼ cup finely chopped  garlic chives 
 2 cloves  garlic , peeled and minced 
 1 tablespoon  dark soy sauce 
 ½ teaspoon  sesame oil 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 1 package potsticker or  gyoza wrappers 
 2 tablespoons  oil  for frying the dumplings 
 Directions : 
 Drain the  tofu , cut into cubes and mash. 
 Wash and prepare the vegetables. 
 Combine the  tofu  with the remainder of the ingredients and seasonings. 
 Lay out one of the gyoza wrappers in front of you. 
 Dip your finger in the  water  and moisten the edges of the wrapper. 
 Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper. 
 Fold the gyoza wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to seal it shut (you may want to use a  cornstarch / water  mixture to make this easier). 
 Heat 2 tablespoons  oil  in a large skillet or wok. 
 When  oil  is ready, carefully add the dumplings and cook on high heat until golden brown (about 1 minute). 
 Without turning the dumplings over, add ½ cup of  water  and cover. 
 Cook for about 1 minute to cook the raw filling and then uncover and continue cooking until most of the liquid is absorbed. 
 Serve the potstickers with the burnt side on top, with potsticker dipping sauce or soy sauce mixed with minced  ginger  for dipping.
