 Egypt is a culinary adventure. The variety of Egyptian recipes is extensive, and utilizes many types of food. Rice and bread form the bulk of Egyptian main courses, which may be served either as lunch or dinner. Egyptian cuisine is known for flavor and its use of fresh ingredients. The staple in every Arab's diet is a bread called aish (means life). For most Egyptians, meat is a luxury used in small amounts, cooked with vegetables and served with or over rice. Fava beans are also important in the diet. An Egyptian course would consist of soup, meat, vegetable stew, bread, salad and rice or pasta. Desserts consist of mostly fruit and sometimes pastry or puddings which can be drenched in honey as well as baklava (filo dough, honey, and nuts).
