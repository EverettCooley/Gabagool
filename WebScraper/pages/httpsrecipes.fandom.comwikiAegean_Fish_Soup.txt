 Description : 
       Aegean Fish Soup     
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 3/4	kg	mixed (below) prepared whole rinsed and drained 
 2	tbl	 olive oil 
 8	sm	 Potatoes  peeled whole 
 6	sm	 Onions  peeled whole 
 2	x	 Carrots  peeled and quartered 
 2	sm	stalks  Celery  including some leaves chopped 
 225	gm	courgettes quartered into 50mm lengths 
 2	x	 Lemon 
 1	x	 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Place the  olive oil  in a very large  saucepan  with 1.4L of  water  bring to the boil and boil rapidly for 45 minutes in order to emulsify the liquid. 
 Sprinkle in some seasoning and add the fish. 
 Bring back to the boil and skim until clear. 
 Cover and cook for about 10 minutes. 
 Then add all the vegetables. 
 They should be half immersed in the broth so add a little hot  water  if necessary but beware of too much liquid as it will result in a tasteless soup. 
 Cook for 20 to 30 minutes for large fish or less for smaller ones making sure the fish does not disintegrate. 
 It midst hold together so that it can be taken out whole without breaking if possible. 
 If the fish are small and cook quicker they should be taken out earlier and kept warm. 
 Add in the juice of 1  lemon  at the end. 
 Carefully take the fish out of the liquid transfer it to a warmed platter and surround it with the vegetables. 
 Serve the  Soup  separately and ask people to help themselves to a piece of and a selection of vegetables; or if they prefer they can have the  Soup  first and fish and vegetables afterwards.
