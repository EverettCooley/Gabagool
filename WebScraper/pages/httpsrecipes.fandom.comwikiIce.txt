Ice  is the solid form of  water ; it is typically available as ice cubes or chips.   Ice is considerably colder than most drinkable liquids, so it is may be used to chill drinks.  It may also be used to create drinks with a thick or slushy consistency.  
 Ice cubes are typically formed by filling small molds with water and setting them to freeze; decorative molds may be used to add interest.  
 Decorative ice sculptures may be made by carving large blocks of ice into a desired shape; these can be used as centerpieces on a table or in a punch bowl.
