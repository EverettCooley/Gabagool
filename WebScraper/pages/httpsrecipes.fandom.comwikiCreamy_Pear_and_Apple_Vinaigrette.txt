 Makes 2½ cups. 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup minced  ginger 
 2 cups diced peeled  pear 
 ½ cup  apple juice 
 ¼ cup  apple cider vinegar 
 ¼ cup  brown rice syrup 
 ¼ cup  walnut oil  or  olive oil 
 1 tablespoon toasted  sesame oil 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 Directions : 
 Place the minced ginger in your hand, firmly squeeze it over a small bowl to catch all of the juices of the ginger, it should yield at least 2 tablespoons of juice, and then discard the minced ginger (or use it in another dish). 
 Transfer the ginger juice to a blender or food processor, add the remaining ingredients, and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy. 
 Transfer the vinaigrette to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. 
 Use the vinaigrette on salads, mixed grains, or in place of soy mayonnaise in recipes.
