 6  bamboo leaves  (or aluminum foil) 
 Directions : 
 Steam or boil mung bean with half a tsp of salt until soft, may take up to 45 minutes depending on how large your steamer is. 
 Smash bean thoroughly. 
 Place 2 leaves in one direction, slightly overlapping, then 2 perpendicular, also overlapping, and the last layer like the first. 
 If use aluminum foil, place them crossing each other. 
 Place half of the rice on the leaves, topped with half of the mung beans. 
 Lay the pork on top of the beans, and then add the last of the beans followed by last of the rice. 
 Fold the leaves/foils over the cake very tightly into a square, use string to secure the cake.
