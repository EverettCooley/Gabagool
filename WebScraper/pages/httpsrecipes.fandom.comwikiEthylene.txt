Ethylene is a chemical compound that some plants produce as a gas. It acts as a hormone for plants, which encourages ripening. Thus Ethylene producing fruits and vegetables will tend to ripen faster if they are not given adequate ventilation. In addition, other plants that are stored in enclosed locations with Ethylene producing plants will tend to ripen faster then they normally would.
