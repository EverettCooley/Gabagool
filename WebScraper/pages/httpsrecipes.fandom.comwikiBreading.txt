About breading : 
 A coating of crumbs. 
 The process of coating food with the  bread  or  cracker crumbs  before it is cooked. The food is then baked, saut√©ed, broiled, or deep-fried in order to create a crispy, crunchy covering. Unless the food is already moist, it is first coated with a liquid such as beaten eggs so that the crumbs will adhere to the food.
