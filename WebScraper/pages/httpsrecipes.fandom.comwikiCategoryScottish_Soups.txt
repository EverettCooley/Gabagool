 Scottish soups may take different forms, depending on the region of Scotland where they are prepared. Scottish tomato and apple soup is another representative dish for the Scottish cuisine, with its wonderful combination of flavors. The soup will result as a cream and it can be served hot garnished with chives or chilled. Scottish broth is another traditional dish made after a classic recipe. Itâ€™s a consistent and tasty dish with loads of ingredients like swede (or turnips as they are called in Scotland), carrots, leeks, barley, split peas and red lentils, parsnips, onions and many more. It can be prepared one day ahead, it will stay fine in the refrigerator and it will be heated before serving. A soup is tastier if it is rich in ingredients and this Scottish traditional dish is in particularly rich in proteins and vitamins.
