 About Grape tomatoes : 
 Grape tomatoes are also called lycopersion esculentum and they belong to the tomato family, as they represent a small kind of oblong tomatoes, which combine the tastes of cherry tomato and plum tomato. The name “grape” comes from their size, as they look like a large grape in a bright red. More specifically, their size varies from 1” long to ¾” wide. The vegetables are original from Taiwan and they are considered difficult to grow, as they produce a low number of varieties. In Taiwan and other parts of Asia, the grape tomatoes are consumed as snacks and they are also introduced in meals.
