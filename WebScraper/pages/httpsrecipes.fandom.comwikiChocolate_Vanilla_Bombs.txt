Description : 
 Involving a divine, sweet combination of real chocolate, butter, and vanilla in a biscuit, this stuffed, biscuit-based dessert is great for the accompaniment to any meal and baked to bold and glorious perfection. Caramel sometimes works for this for dipping, too.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 2 cans of pre-made biscuits (20 pieces) 
 2 bars of chocolate, cut into cubes 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 2 pods vanilla 
 4 tablespoons chocolate syrup 
 1 tablespoon brown sugar 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 375Â° C. 
 Cut each biscuit in half and slightly roll out. Place a chocolate cube in the middle and wrap the biscuit dough around the cube, ensuring the edges are sealed. Roll with your hands to make a ball shape. 
 Slit the vanilla pods with a kitchen knife. 
 Place butter and the contents from the vanilla pod in a small bowl and melt in the microwave about 12 seconds. 
 In a separate bowl, combine chocolate syrup and brown sugar. 
 Dip each rolled biscuit into the butter mixture and then into the chocolate mixture. Place on a parchment-lined pan. 
 Bake 10-15 minutes or just until browned. Serve hot and plain or with other desserts.
