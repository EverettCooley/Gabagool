 The need for some foods that could be served between the main meals determined the development of the snack recipes. As most of the other dishes, the snacks are based on vegetables and fruits. The fruits themselves are sometimes consumed as snacks. In this category are: mangoes, berries, papayas, oranges and many others. The artificial snacks are made from sugar and flour. Jamaicans also combine the artificial snacks with the fruits and the results are dishes such as: Coconut Drops, cornmeal pudding, grapefruit and milk. Many types of breads that also contain fruits are prepared in Jamaica. The beef patties represent one of the Jamaican snacks that became popular all over the world. These are usually consumed between the lunch and the dinner. Each baker seems to have a specific style of preparing these snacks. The quantities of spices differ very much.
