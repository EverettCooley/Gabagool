 Ingredients : 
 vegetable oil  - 1 tbsp, 
 butter  - 25 g (1 oz), 
 Loin of  Pork  - 1 kg (2 lb) rinded, 
 garlic  cloves - 2, 
 Onion  - 1 large chopped,

 juniper berries  - 5, 
 sage  - 4 sprigs, plus extra for garnish. 
 Directions : 
 1. Heat  oil  and  butter  in a large saucepan into which the meat will just fit. Fry the  Pork ,  garlic  and  Onion  for 15 minutes, until the  Pork  is browned on all sides. Add the  milk ,  juniper berries  and  sage .
 2. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 1–2 hours, until the  Pork  is tender and cooked through, turning and basting from time to time.
 3. Transfer the  Pork  to a serving dish. Discard the  garlic ,  juniper berries  and  sage . The milky cooking juices will look curdled, so sieve or liquidise until smooth.
