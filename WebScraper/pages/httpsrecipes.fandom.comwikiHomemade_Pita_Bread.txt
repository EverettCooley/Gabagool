 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 	 	envelope  dry yeast 
 2 	 	teaspoons  salt 
 1 	 	tablespoon  Sugar 
 4 	 	cups white  all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2 	 	cups  water 
 1 	 	tablespoon  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 1. 	Combine the  yeast  and  Sugar  in a small bowl, add 1/2 cup of the warm  water  and let it stand for 10 minutes to proof and ferment it.
 2. 	Dissolve the  salt  in the remaining warm  water .
 3. 	Put the  flour  in a large mixing bowl, making a well in the middle and put the dissolved  yeast  and  salt   water  into it.
 4. 	With your hands, blend it into a dough.
 5. 	You may need a bit more or less  water  depending on your  flour .
 6. 	Knead the dough in the bowl with your fists for 10–15 minutes or until it is smooth.
 7. 	Pour the  oil  over the dough and knead it again until the  oil  is absorbed.
 8. 	Cover the dough in the bowl with a towel and set it in a draft free area to rise to double it's bulk (1–2 hours), then punch it down and knead it again for a few minutes.
 9. 	Preheat your oven to 350 °F.
 10. 	Cut pieces of dough,  egg  size or larger, depending on the size of the pita desired, shape them into balls with your hands and roll them out over a lightly floured board or pastry cloth to 1/4 inch thickness.
 11. 	Set 2 or 3 pitas on a lightly oiled cookies sheet and bake them on the lower rack 2 to 3 minutes each side.
 12. 	Pitas should be white and soft.
 13. 	Wrap the baked pitas in a clean towel until they are cool, then store them in plastic bags to prevent them from drying out.
 14. 	When you are ready to use them, heat a bit of  oil  in a shallow skillet and fry them a minute or so on each side, or until golden brown.
 15. 	Use them immediately, because they get hard when they dry out.
