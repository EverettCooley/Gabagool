Ingredients : 
 1¾ litres  vodka 
 3 cups  honey 
 3 cups  water 
 2½ teaspoon  vanilla 
 ½ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 8  cinnamon  sticks 
 8 whole  cloves 
 peel of one whole  orange 
 Directions : 
 Boil water and honey. Carefully remove the foam. 
 Add all remaining ingredients except Vodka. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 
 Allow mixture to cool slightly. When cooled add the Vodka and stir until well mixed. 
 Add everything including solids to a suitable container, I usually distribute into two containers splitting solids evenly. 
 Store in a cool dark place for one week. The longer this sits the better the flavor will be. 
 Serve room temperature, chilled or even warmed. Just serve it often. 
 For Storage, you just can't beat the green Grolsch beer bottle. I always save mine for this purpose as well as making the flavored Olive oils that everyone enjoys. If you go to the bigger Liquor stores, you can find the 50-ounce Grolsch bottles. This recipe will nearly fill both of them. The 12 ounce bottles also make a great gift for those close friends that you may want to share with.
