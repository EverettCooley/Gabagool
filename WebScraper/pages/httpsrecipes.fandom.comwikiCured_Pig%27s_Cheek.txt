      guancial di maiale     
 Description : 
 Cured pig's cheek or guanciale di maiale (literally translates to cheek of the pig) is hands-down the BEST bacon I have ever eaten - and have yet to find someone who disagrees once they taste it's porky goodness! In Italy it is served at home and commonly found on the menus of rustic traditional osteria's, family run restaurants just like our farmhouse, as an antipasta atop crostini. Pair best with crusty bread to soak up the juices or better yet blow your diet and serve for breakfast with eggs & toast! The recipe below calls for red wine vinegar which perfectly cuts the fat and combined with the sage makes for a rich meaty buttery deliciousness with a kick!
 
 Ingredients : 
 cured pigâ€™s cheek  (guanciale di maiale) 
 fresh  sage  leaves, few handfuls 
 olive oil 
 garlic  cloves 
 red wine vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Slice cured pig's cheek very thinly or ask your butcher. 
 In a frying pan, on medium heat add 2 glugs of olive oil, garlic cloves & sage leaves, add pig's cheek. 
 Cook for approximately 30 seconds - 1 minute on each side, until changes color to a nice golden brown, but not burned. 
 Blot with a paper towel. 
 Lightly sprinkle with red wine vinegar. 
 Serve immediately with the sage.
