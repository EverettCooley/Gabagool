 ½ bunch  cilantro  leaves, chopped 
 1 bunch  chives , chopped 
 3 teaspoons black pepper, optional, for topping 
 3  sweet potatoes , peeled, steamed, and sliced to ¼" pieces 
 Directions : 
 Combine lobster stock and clam juice and reduce by half. 
 In a blender, mix the orange juice, lime juice, dry mustard, mayonnaise, heavy cream, grain mustard, and aji amarillo; then add it to the stock.
