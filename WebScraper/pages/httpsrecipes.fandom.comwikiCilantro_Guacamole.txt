CILANTRO GUACAMOLE 
This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased 
the family collection from the Irwin Estate in Jacksonville, Texas in 
1987.
2 large avocados seeded and peeled
1 small tomato finely chopped
1/2 small red onion finely chopped
1/2 small red pepper finely chopped
1 jalape√±o chili finely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh limejuice
2 cloves garlic minced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro finely chopped 
1/2 teaspoon cumin 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
Mash avocados in a mixing bowl then stir in remaining ingredients and 
cover and chill for 8 hours.
Serve with tortilla chips.
