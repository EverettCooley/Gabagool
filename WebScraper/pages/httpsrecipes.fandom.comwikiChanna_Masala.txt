 Description : 
 This is a wonderful "confort food" dish - which is really very easy to make. Channa  masala  is spicy  masala   Chickpeas  - and can be as mild or as hot as you like it! It is a classic North Indian vegetarian dish - and is either eaten with  rice  or roti (chappati) as a main meal - or is served as a side-dish with a non-veg dish e.g.  Chicken  or  Lamb . When served as a main meal - it is especially delicious when eaten with a kind of bread called "bhatura" - which is a deep-fried bread. It is also served as a mid-afternoon snack in the form of a "chaat" - which is when it is mixed with a couple of spoonfuls of imli ( tamarind ) chutney and poured on top of a broken samosa with some sprinkling of bhel puri or "sev" fried bits. This is spot-on Indian "street-food". Absolutely delicious!
 Some Punjabis may know this dish as "chole" (pronounced "cholay") - and some of you may recall that I made a packet-mix version of this tasty dish
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2 tins of ready-boiled  chickpeas  - rinsed in a colander 
 1 tin of chopped  tomatoes 
 1 large  onion  chopped into long thin strips 
 3 medium  potatoes , peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks 
 chunks of frozen, pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and  green chile 
 spices:  turmeric  (halidi),  garam masala ,  ground coriander ,  salt 
 seeds:  onion  seed and  cumin  ( jeera ) seeds. 
 a large large pot in which to pour 2 or 3 tablespoons of  vegetable oil 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  in the pot until hot. Add the  Onion  and  cumin  seeds and watch them pop and fizzle for around 20 seconds. Then add the chopped  onions  and fry until they are lightly browned. Then add the frozen (and by now thawed) chunks of pulped  ginger ,  garlic  and chillie. Stir fry on medium heat.
 
       Fry the onions after spluttering some onion and cumin seed in oil     
         When onions are slightly browned add the pulped ginger, garlic and cillie     
 Then add the tin of chopped  tomato  and stir-fry for about 5 mins on medium-to-high heat until the  oil  starts to separate from the  Onion / tomato  mixture - and then add the spices:
 
 2 teaspoons of  salt 
 2 teaspoons of ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons of  garam masala 
 1.5 teaspoons of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 Stir it all thoroughly on medium flame.
 
         Add the tined of chopped tomatoe     
         Add the spices     
 Then add the chunks of  Potato  - stir until well coated in spices. Then add around 3 smallish glasses of  water  into the pot - and put the lid on and bring to boil. Let it simmer on a very low flame for around 20 mins with the lid on. This will soften the  Potato .
 
         Add the potato chunks     
         Add 3 small glasses of water and bring to boil     
 After about 20 mins - check to see that the  Potato  chunks are soft - and then add the drained (already-boiled)  Chickpeas . Stir it all up - and add another small glass of  water  to the pot. Bring to a fierce boil and then turn the flame down to simmer the pot for a while - with the lid partially on.
 
         Add the chickpeas     
         Add another glass of water and simmer for a while     
 After about a further 15 mins of simmering - add some freshly chopped (or frozen) fresh  coriander leaf  and stir it all in. Keep it simmering for about 10 mins more. After that - turn off the heat - put the lid on tight - and let it is stand for around 15 mins whilst you make some  basmati rice  - or warm some pitta bread etc. It's then ready to serve!
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
