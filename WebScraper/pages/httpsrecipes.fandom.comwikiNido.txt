NIDO (also written 'Nido') is a powdered milk supplement manufactured by Nestl√©. Although there is no age recommendation, marketing is featured around children over three years of age with the tagline "Nutritious Milk for Growing Kids". Nido boasts a fortified formula that includes calcium and vitamin D, and is said to contribute to over twenty essential ingredients a growing child needs. Because of this, the nutritionally-enriched product has become not just a competitor for other milk-based drinks, but also faces scrutiny from supporters of natural milk consumption, including breastfeeders, and is known to be given to one-year-old infants.
