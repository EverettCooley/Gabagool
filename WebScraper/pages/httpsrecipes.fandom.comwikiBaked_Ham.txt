Baked Ham
 10 lb Ham
1 c Brown sugar
1/4 c Flour
1 t Mustard, dry
1/4 c Maple syrup
3 T Water
1 ea Cloves, whole
 Note: This recipe assumes using an uncooked ham. Omit boiling the ham
altogether if using a pre-cooked ham.
Wash ham and cover with boiling water and let cook on top of stove for
4 hours. Let ham stand in liquid over night. Next day remove the
fatty rind, make gashes across the surface of ham and stick in whole
cloves. Make a paste of the sugar, flour and mustard by adding the
syrup and water. Use water in which ham was cooked if available.
Spread over ham and place in roasting pan. Bake uncovered at 400-F for
45 minutes.
