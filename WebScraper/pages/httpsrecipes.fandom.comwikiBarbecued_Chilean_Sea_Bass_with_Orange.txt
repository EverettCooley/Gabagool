      Barbecued Chilean Sea Bass with Orange     
 Description : 
 If cooking the Chilean sea bass on a charcoal grill, be sure that the fillet pieces are at least 1½ inches thick to ensure that the fish won't fall apart when it is cooked.
 
 This recipe yields 4 servings. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  Chilean sea bass  fillet - (to 1½ lbs) bones removed, cut into serving pieces 
 ¾ cup  orange juice 
 3 tbsp  tomato paste 
 2 tbsp  vegetable oil 
 2 tbsp  vinegar 
 1 tbsp  brown sugar  or  honey 
 2  garlic  cloves minced or pressed 
 1 tsp grated  orange zest 
 1 tsp  ginger  ground 
 ½ tsp dried hot  red pepper flakes 
 Directions : 
 Rinse the Chilean sea bass with cold  water  and pat dry with paper towels. 
 Set the fish in a shallow dish. 
 Stir together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl until well combined, then pour over the fish, turning the fish so that it is evenly coated. 
 Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours. 
 Preheat a charcoal grill or the broiler. 
 Grill or broil the fish about 4 inches from the heat until well browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes; brush with more marinade and cook on the other side until the fish is no longer opaque in the center, about 5 minutes longer.
