 Traditional Scottish cuisine is often adjusted to fit lacto-ovo-vegetarian demands. Although meat plays an important role in most Scottish dishes, it is possible to find excellent Scottish vegetarian cooking. However, in some restaurants you will find some of dishes that rely on a strictly vegetarian regime. The only thing that makes Scottish vegetarian pies different from a regular pie is the main ingredient, the potatoes. The potatoes will be sliced thinly and layers of potatoes and leeks are created. The Scottish vegetarian cuisine is very appreciated especially by those who want to stay fit. You will have a hard time finding strict vegetarian dishes in Scottish households, but you should get the option to choose a vegetarian version of many popular Scottish dishes when having lunch or dinner in a restaurant.
