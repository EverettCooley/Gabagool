Ingredients : 
 ⅛th of a litre (⅔ cup) of  water 
 1 pinch of  salt 
 7.5 grams (¼ oz) of  powdered sugar 
 50 grams (1.75 oz) of  butter 
 62½ grams (2.2 oz) of  flour 
 2  eggs 
 a frying pan or frying appliance with  palm  or  peanut oil  if available. Otherwise, use  vegetable oil . The  oil  temperature should be around 150°C (302°F). 
 2 tablespoons of fine  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Boil the  water  with the  salt , the  sugar  and the  butter . 
 When the  water  begins to boil, throw the  flour  in all at once. 
 Actively knead it with a spatula and let it cook for two minutes while incessantly kneading it, until the dough detaches itself from the bottom of the pot. 
 Remove from flame and let it cool, then add the  eggs  one by one. 
 Work the dough energetically after adding the first  egg , to cause a little air to enter into the dough. 
 Beat the second  egg  and add slowly, until the dough is ready. 
 The dough should not be too soft, or too liquidly. 
 Let it cool. 
 Warm up the frying pan. 
 It should not be very hot at the beginning. 
 Form small balls of dough of about 4–5 cm in diameter. 
 Drop them in the  oil  and let them cook while slowly adding heat to the fryer, in such a way that it is up to 150°C (302°F) when the beignets have been cooked. 
 Pull them out when golden brown and serve hot, dipped in fine  sugar .
