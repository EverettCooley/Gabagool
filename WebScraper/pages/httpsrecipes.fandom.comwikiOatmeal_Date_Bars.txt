 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup of white  flour 
 1 cup of raw  oatmeal 
 2/3 cup of packed  brown sugar  (or 1/2 cup  Regular sugar  plus 1/4 cup of date syrup) 
 1/4 teaspoon  baking soda 
 1/4 teaspoon  baking powder 
 1/2 cup of  butter  or  margarine , softened 
 1 cup of packed, chopped pitted  dates , 1/2 cup of  water , and juice of a  lemon 
 (or 1 cup of date paste and 3 Tablespoons of  butter ) 
 1/3 cup of chopped  nuts  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Make the filling by boiling the  dates  with the  water  for about 5 minutes or until bubbly and soft. 
 Remove from heat and add the  lemon juice  and  nuts . (Alternatively, heat the date paste with the 3 Tablespoons of  margarine  and  nuts .) 
 In a mixing bowl, combine the  flour ,  oatmeal ,  Sugar ,  baking soda , and  baking powder . 
 Cut in the  margarine  until the mixture resembles course crumbs. 
 Press 2/3 of the  flour  mixture in a 9" x 9" baking pan. 
 Spread the filling over it. 
 Sprinkle the remaining  flour  mixture over the top. 
 Very lightly press the top. (You want the top to be flaky, so press only to help the crumbs stick on once cooked.) 
 Bake in a 350 °F oven for about 30–35 minutes or until the top is golden. 
 Cut into squares and serve warm or cool.
