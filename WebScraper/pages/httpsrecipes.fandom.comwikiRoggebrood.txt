Description : 
 This is a very dark, very heavy rye bread. It is baked as a large round bread and will weigh approximately a kilo-and-a-half when done. Traditionally this bread is eaten with  pea soup .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1250 g  rye flour 
 1 tbsp crushed  caraway seed 
 1 sachet  dry yeast 
 ¾ liter boiling  water 
 350 g  sourdough 
 2 tbsp  salt 
 oil  to grease the tin 
 ⅛ liter  water 
 2 tsp  cornflour 
 Directions : 
 Put the  flour  in a large bowl and mix with the  caraway seed  and  yeast . 
 Make a dent in the middle and pour in the boiling  water . 
 Stir while it is cooling down. 
 Add the sourdough to the chunky  flour . 
 Add  salt  and knead thoroughly. 
 Put in a bowl that is dusted with  flour , and leave covered overnight in a warm spot to rise. 
 Knead the dough for about 20 minutes the next day, until it comes away from the bowl. 
 Form a ball of the dough and leave in a covered bowl in a warm spot to rise for about an hour. 
 Knead again and finally leave to rise for another 30 minutes. 
 Pre-heat the oven to 250°C. 
 Shape the dough into a round, high loaf. 
 Put on a greased baking sheet and score the top. 
 Take care, this has to be done quickly to avoid heat loss from the oven: put the sheet in the middle of the oven and pour 1 cup of boiling  water  on the bottom shelf of the oven. 
 Close the oven door and leave closed for 5 minutes. 
 Open the oven door on place another cup of boiling  water  on the bottom shelve and close the door. 
 Reduce the temperature to 200°C after 15 minutes and bake the bread for another hour. 
 Mix the  cornflour  with some cold  water  to make a paste. 
 Boil ⅛ liter of  water  and bind it with the  cornflour  paste. 
 When the bread comes out of the oven, brush the  cornflour  over the bread for a lovely sheen.
