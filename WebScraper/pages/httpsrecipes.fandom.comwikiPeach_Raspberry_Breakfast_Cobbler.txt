 Ingredients : 
 5 cups sliced peeled  peaches 
 1 cup  raspberries 
 3 tbsp  minute tapioca 
 ½ cup  granulated sugar 
 1 tbsp  baking powder 
 2½ cups  flour , including  oat , white,  whole wheat , other 
 4 – 6 tbsp  butter  or  margarine 
 1½ cups  buttermilk , approximately 
 Directions : 
 Grease lasagna pan. 
 Add peaches, sugar, minute tapioca. 
 Bake at 400°F while you prepare the dough. 
 Mix baking powder and flour (I like 1 cup oat flour, ½ cup white flour, ½ cup whole wheat and ½ cup barley, but there are many delicious possibilities). 
 Cut in shortening as for pie crust. 
 Add buttermilk, stirring with fork. 
 You can make a thick biscuit dough and roll it to fit the size of your pan, or you can make a looser dough like a batter. 
 Add raspberries to peaches; return to oven for 5 minutes to heat. 
 Then remove from oven and either place rolled dough on top and slit some air holes in it or else quickly drop spoonfuls of it to cover the fruit. 
 Bake at 400°F or even 450°F for about 20 minutes.
