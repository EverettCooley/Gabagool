Description : 
 The following is an excerpt from  The Book Grill!  by Pippa Cuthbert and Lindsay Cameron Wilson. Decadent! I'll never forget the day I first tasted grilled angel food cake with a dollop of  chocolate  cream. Nothing has really been the same since. Of course you can make your own cake if you prefer, but store-bought is the simple and guaranteed-to-be fluffy option.
