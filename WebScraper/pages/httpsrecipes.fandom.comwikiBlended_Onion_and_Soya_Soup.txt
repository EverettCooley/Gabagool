 Notes 
 A wide range of nourishing vegetarian soups can be made this way. Less soya flour and less cheese can be used. This is more a stew than a soup. A potato can be used instead of one of the onions. I use what I have to hand to make a wide range of easy blended vegetarian soups. People with gluten allergy can leave out the flour but then it is less nice, has to be stirred and is much more likely to curdle. A wide range of spices can substitute for what I used. Oil can be added before blending. Olive oil, linseed oil and repe seed oil are healthy.
