 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup crumbled  blue cheese 
 2 tablespoons  butter , softened and divided 
 ¾ teaspoon dried  thyme 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 2 whole boneless  chicken breasts  with skin (not split) 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 ½ teaspoon  paprika 
 Directions : 
 Prepare the broiler for grilling. Combine blue cheese, 1 tablespoon butter and thyme in a small bowl until blended. 
 Season with salt and pepper. Loosen skin over the breast of chicken by pushing fingers on skin, taking care not to tear skin. 
 Spread blue cheese mixture under skin with a rubber spatula or small spoon. Massage skin to evenly spread cheese mixture. 
 Place chicken skin side down on grid over medium coals. Grill, covered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining butter then mix with lemon juice and paprika. 
 Turn chicken and brush with the lemon juice mixture. Grill 7 minutes more. 
 Transfer chicken to the carving board and cut each breast in half. Serve warm and plain over rice, or with other main dishes, side dishes or appetizers.
