Description : 
 Somehow, the English translation "Cuban  Chicken  with  rice " just doesn't do this exotic dish justice. Serve with salad,  garlic   bread , and wine, and you'll have a feast. Note that  saffron  is often less expensive if you purchase it at an oriental or other ethnic specialty market. You can make this dish a day ahead and reheat it. (If you double or triple the recipe, reduce the amount of  water ).
