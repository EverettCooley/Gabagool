Description : 
 This simple sambol is as basic to the food of Sri Lanka as  salt  and  pepper  are to Western food. Very hot, very acidic and distinctly salty, it is often the only accompaniment to serve with  rice , boiled  yams ,  manioc  or  sweet potato , or any of the starches that are the staple of the native diet.
 
 Ingredients : 
 10  dried chilies 
 1 tablespoon pounded  dried shrimps 
 1 small  onion , chopped 
 lemon juice  and  salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Remove stalks from the chilies and if a less hot result is preferred, shake out the seeds. 
 Pound all together in a mortar and pestle. In Sri Lanka, this would be either pounded or ground on the grinding stone. It can be done in a blender, but a wet result is not desirable. It should be a paste. 
 Serve with  rice  or pittu.
