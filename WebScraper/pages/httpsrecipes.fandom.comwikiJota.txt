 Ingredients : 
 2¼ cups (14 – 16 oz) wine  sauerkraut 
 1 cup (8 oz) soaked beans ( borlotti ) 
 2¼ cups (14 oz)  potatoes 
 1 lb (smoked)  pork  ribs, you could also use  pancetta  or other smoked pork meat 
 clove of  garlic 
 bay leaf 
 ½ tsp  cumin 
 olive oil 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Cook the soaked (overnight) beans with the bay leaf in boiling water. 
 Meanwhile cook in another pan the peeled and diced potatoes. 
 Heat a little extra virgin olive oil in a separate pan, add a clove of garlic, sauerkraut with bay leaf, cumin and salt, then add water until everything is covered and then submit the smoked pork on top and gently cook everything. 
 If the sauerkraut is cooked add the cooked beans and potatoes and cook for another few minutes. If the soup is too thick add a little water to the desired thickness. 
 If you prefer a more creamy result, you can pass the soup through a mesh sieve or a strainer.
