 About preserves, jam and fruit butter : 
 Jam  is a thick mixture of fruit, sugar that is cooked until the pieces of fruit are very soft and almost formless. It is used as a bread spread, a filling for pastries and cookies and an ingredient for various desserts. Apricot, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, cherry, peach, sweet and sour plum, raspberry, and strawberry are among the prepared varieties available. Berry jams such as blackberry and raspberry are available seedless.
 Preserves  differ from jam in that the chunks of fruit are medium to large rather than the texture of thick pur√©e. Sometimes preserves are called "whole-fruit jams".
 Fruit butter  is a sweet spread made of fruit cooked to a paste, then lightly sweetened. It falls into the same category as jelly and jam.  Apple butter  is a common example.
 The fruit is cooked at first, but not too much, as the fruit will burn and soon lose its sugary taste. However, if done right, the newly made fruit butter, true to its name, has the same texture as, but different flavor than, regular butter.
