 ½ teaspoon dried hot  red pepper flakes 
 ⅔ cup  vegetable oil 
 18 x 8-inch wooden skewers, soaked in warm  water  for 1 hour 
 18 large  shrimp , shelled 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan of boiling  water  boil the  garlic  for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is tender but not soft, drain it, and discard the peel carefully, leaving the cloves whole. 
 In a bowl whisk together the  dill seed , the fresh  dill , the  lemon juice , and the  red pepper flakes 
 Add the  oil  in a stream, whisking, and whisk the marinade until it is emulsified. 
 Onto the end of each skewer thread a  shrimp  and 1  garlic  clove. 
 Arrange the skewers,  shrimp  end down, in a bowl just large enough to hold them. 
 Pour the marinade over the  shrimp , and let the  shrimp  marinate 
 Cover loosely and chill, basting them occasionally, for 3 hours. 
 Drain the  shrimp , arrange them in a shallow baking pan, and bake them in the upper third of a preheated 425°F oven for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are just cooked through.
