 Also called "jen dol"
 
 Ingredients : 
 10  screwpine leaves 
 2 – 3 drops green  food coloring 
 ½ cup  green pea flour  (hoon kway) 
 5 tablespoons  palm sugar 
 1 tablespoon  granulated sugar 
 4½ cups  water 
 1  coconut , grated 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Pound  screwpine leaves  to extract the juice. 
 Add sufficient  water  to the juice with green  food coloring  to make 2 cups. 
 Mix  green pea flour  with the juice. 
 Cook this mixture over medium heat stirring continuously until it bubbles. 
 Place chendol frame (I have no idea what this even looks like, but should be a sieve with large holes) over a basin of cold  water  and  ice cubes . 
 Spoon the cooked screwpine mixture onto the chendol frame and with a spatula, press through the holes into the cold  water . 
 Drain off the  water  and chill the chendol. 
 Boil the  palm sugar  and  granulated sugar  with ½ cup  water  to get syrup. 
 Strain and cool the syrup. 
 Add the remaining  water  to the  grated coconut  and extract  coconut milk . 
 Add a good pinch of  salt  to the  coconut milk . 
 To serve, place 1 tablespoon chendol into a small serving bowl, then add 1 tablespoon syrup and ¼ cup  coconut milk . 
 Top the bowl with  ice  shavings and serve immediately. 
 Note: if pure  green pea flour  is used, mix 2½ cups of screwpine juice to ½ cup  green pea flour .
