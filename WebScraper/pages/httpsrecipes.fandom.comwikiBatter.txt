A semi-liquid mixture, generally of flour, liquid (milk or water), eggs, sugar and a leavening agent, used to make baked goods like cakes, quick breads and muffins and stovetop items like pancakes and crepes. Unlike stiffer dough, batter is thin enough to pour because it contains a higher proportion of fat, sugar and liquid. 
 A simple batter of starch and liquid can be used to coat ingredients that are to be deep-fried.
