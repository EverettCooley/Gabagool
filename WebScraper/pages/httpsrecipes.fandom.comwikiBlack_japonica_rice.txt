 About Black japonica rice : 
 Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. Black Japonica is a combination of Asian black short-grain rice and medium-grain mahogany rice that were grown together in the same field. It is available in well-stocked food stores, gourmet shops, and through mail order. When cooked it provides a nutty mushroom flavor coupled with a subtle, sweet spiciness and juicy texture that goes well as a side dish, in rice salads, casseroles, as a stuffing for turkey or bell peppers, or in stir-fried foods. It also combines well with other rices. Its dark color turns the cooking water a purplish brown. Black Japonica rice is full in natural vitamins, minerals and fiber and is very healthy ingredient.
