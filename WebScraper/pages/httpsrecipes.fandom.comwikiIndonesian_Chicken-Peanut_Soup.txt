 Description : 
 This earthy and complex soup brings to mind hot tropical suns and perfumed air. It's exotic but pleasantly soâ€”and is a wonderful start to roast  Pork , broiled fish, or other plain fare. Serve hot as a first course in small bowls to 4-6 people. Selamat makan! (or, "good eating").
 
       Indonesian Chicken-Peanut Soup     
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups  chicken stock 
 2 Tablespoons soy sauce 
 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons  molasses 
 2 Tablespoons fresh  lemon juice 
 2 cloves  garlic , pressed or mashed 
 1/4 cup  Peanut   butter 
 1/3 cup  peanuts , chopped 
 1 cup cooked  Chicken , slivered 
 1/2 cup  green onions , sliced in rounds 
 Garnish : 
 green onions , sliced lengthwise into thin strips then latticed across the top of each bowl 
 Directions : 
 In a large saucepan, combine the stock, soy sauce,  molasses ,  lemon juice , and  garlic . It seems like an awful
combination at first, but it mellows together into a  savory  broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes.
Whisk in the  Peanut   butter , then simmer for 5 more minutes.  
When ready to serve, stir in the  peanuts ,  Chicken , and scallions. Heat through, then ladle into soup bowls and lattice the tops with  scallion  strips.  Serve immediately.
