Smoked Carnitas 
 6 pounds pork butt 
1 large onion, diced 
4 tablespoons ground New Mexican chile 
1 tablespoon cumin seed, roasted and ground 
2 teaspoons granulated garlic 
1 teaspoon dry oregano 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon black pepper 
to cover water
 Smoke the pork butt with your favorite wood at a low temperature for 
about three hours. You might even consider boning it and cutting it 
in two pieces. The idea here is to get the smoke flavor and not to 
cook it till it is tender. Once you think you have plenty of smoke on 
the butt, transfer it to a large pot. Add the remaining ingredients 
and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a hard simmer 
and cook, stirring occasionally for about 2 hours. When stirring, 
stir hard, trying to break the pork up. When the water is gone, but 
there is still plenty of moisture, the pork is done. 
 This is excellent meat for use in tacos. To make tacos, heat two 
small corn tortillas on a hot plate. Fill hot tortilla with some of 
the carnitas. Add a big spoonful of freshly made Pico De Gallo and 
your favorite salsa or hot sauce. The tacos should be eaten on a 
double tortilla. The inside tortilla soaks up all the juices, while 
the outside tortilla stays dry so you can handle it without making a 
mess. The smoked carnitas would also be great as a filling for 
taquitos.
