 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g/1Â lb raw cashews 
 oil  for deep frying 
 2 teaspoons  chilli powder 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 Directions : 
 Heat  oil  in a wok or other deep pan and fry the cashews over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a slotted metal spoon so they colour evenly. 
 When pale golden, remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 
 Don't wait until the colour is as deep as you think it should be, because the  nuts  will continue to cook in their own heat even after they have been removed from the  oil . 
 When all the  nuts  have been fried and drained, combine  chilli powder  and  salt  and sprinkle over, tossing well to distribute the flavours. 
 When cold, dust off excess  salt  and  chilli powder  and serve. May be made a week or two before required and stored in an airtight container.
