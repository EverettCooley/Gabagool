 Buttermilk  is what was left over after having made  butter . Either sweet or  sour cream  was used to make  butter . We used to let some  milk  sit in a crock for a couple of days, unrefrigerated. The  cream  would settle on top. This  cream  was skimmed off and accumulated until enough was collected to make  butter . It takes about a quart of  cream  to make about a pound of  butter .
 We only had one cow and it took several days to accumulate enough  cream . Anyway, during the summer and without refrigeration, the  cream  would have soured but it still made an excellent  butter . In the winter the  cream  was accumulated and because of cool weather, it was still sweet when the  butter  was churned.
 Anyway the  cream  would be chilled and whipped or beaten until the  butter  formed. When the  butter  forms, it is in small pieces in the now  buttermilk  mixture. The  buttermilk  was poured off and invariably small pieces of  butter  went with it.
 Buttermilk  was considered an excellent drink and also used in many ways in cooking. The  butter  when separated from the  buttermilk  would be washed several times and then normally salted and packed into a form for use.
 After the  cream  was skimmed for making  butter  and the  milk  was left in the crock to sour. When soured, it was like a single large clump. This clump of soured  milk  was broken up into smaller clumps. Each clump of soured  milk  formed a piece of  cottage cheese . It was necessary to break up the single large clump but you only wanted to break small enough for the whey to drain. The clumps of soured  milk  was poured into several layers of cheese cloth and hung up to drip. A clear whey would drip off leaving the  cottage cheese .
 The longer it was left hanging to drip, the drier the  cheese  became.
