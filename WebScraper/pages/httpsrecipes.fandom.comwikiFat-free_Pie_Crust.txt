Ingredients : 
 2 cups  Grape-Nuts 
 ½ cup  apple juice  concentrate 
 Directions : 
 Mix together and press into the pie pan. 
 Bake 10 minutes at 350°F and cool if you'll add a cool filling. 
 For  pumpkin  pie, i just add the filling and bake it all at once. 
 I run the  Grape-Nuts  through the food processor first, and I find a half recipe is sufficient if you don't need the crust to go too far up the side of the pan.
