Eat with any of the dishes that have 'soup' with them.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 – 4 fresh  tomatoes  and 1 – 2  bell peppers   or  16 oz  tomato sauce  + 6 oz  tomato paste . (bell pepper is optional) 
 meat  /  chicken  /  fish 
 4 Maggi cubes 
 palm oil  if available, otherwise use  vegetable oil 
 2  onions 
 salt 
 dry  pepper 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Place the meat in a pot, add very little water (most meat produces water as it cooks), dice one onion in with the meat, add some salt, and cook the meat until it is almost tender. 
 If you are using fresh ingredients, grind the tomatoes and the bell peppers together. You can grind in another onion in with them if you wish. 
 Pour the blended tomato mixture (or the tomato sauce and tomato paste) into the pot with the meat. Also add the palm oil or vegetable oil. 
 Allow to cook for about 20 – 30 minutes, stirring constantly. 
 Add salt and dry pepper to taste.
