 Ingredients : 
 1¾ cup  whole wheat flour 
 ½ cup  oatmeal 
 ½ cup  cornmeal 
 ¼ cup liver powder (available at health food stores) 
 2 Tablespoons  brewer's yeast  powder 
 ¼ cup bone meal powder 
 3 Tablespoons  powdered milk 
 2  eggs , lightly beaten 
 3 Tablespoons  wheat germ oil  (you may substitute  bacon drippings ) 
 ½ cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Preheat The Oven to 325 °F. 
 In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the  flour ,  oatmeal ,  cornmeal , liver powder,  brewer's yeast , bone meal, and  powdered milk  (may also add  beef  or  chicken bouillon  cubes). 
 Stir in the  eggs ,  oil , and  water  and mix thoroughly. The dough will be very stiff and dry (much like dog biscuits!) 
 Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface or pastry cloth. 
 Roll or pat it into a rectangle ¼ to ½ inch thick. 
 Cut into bone-shaped biscuits with a small knife, or use a bone-shaped cookie cutter. 
 Re-roll the leftover scraps of dough and cut into shapes until all the dough is used. 
 Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 40 to 50 minutes until brown and dried through. 
 Cool on a Rack. 
 Enjoy.
