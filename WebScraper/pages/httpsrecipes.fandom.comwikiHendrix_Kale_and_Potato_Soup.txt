Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  garlic  cloves, minced 
 1½ cups chopped  onions 
 ¾ cup sliced  carrots 
 ¼ cup  olive oil 
 2 large  russet potatoes 
 4 cups un-chicken or  vegetable broth 
 package of  soy chorizo 
 8 cups packed  kales , shredded thin 
 1 lb  red potatoes 
 Directions : 
 In a large pot, saute the  garlic ,  onions  and  carrot  in the  oil  over moderately low heat, until vegetables are softened. 
 Add the  russet potatoes , peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces, the broth and 4 cups  water . 
 Bring the liquid to boil and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 - 15 minutes, or until the  potatoes  are tender. 
 While the  potatoes  are cooking, cook the chorizo in some  oil  over moderate heat until browned (it will probably completely fall apart, but that is ok). 
 When browned, transfer to a paper towel to drain. 
 With a slotted spoon, transfer the  potatoes  to a processor, add 1½ cups cooking liquid and puree until smooth. 
 Stir the purée into the broth mixture, add the chorizo, the  kale  and the  red potatoes , cut into 1 inch pieces, and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Simmer covered for 10 minutes, or until the  potatoes  are tender.
