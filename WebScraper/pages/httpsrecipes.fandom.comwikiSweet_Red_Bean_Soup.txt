Ingredients : 
 ⅓ – ½ cup  sugar 
 1 cup  red beans  (soaked in cold  water  overnight) 
 ⅓ cup dried  lotus seeds  (at Asian grocery stores or health food stores, soaked in cold  water  overnight) 
 1 tablespoon  vanilla 
 ¼ cup  pearl tapioca  (optional) 
 ¼ cup glutinous  rice  balls (can be found at Asian grocery stores) (optional) 
 7 cups  water 
 Directions : 
 Combine  water  and beans in a large pot, bring to a boil. 
 Reduce heat to simmer, cook uncovered till beans are tender (about 2 hours?). 
 Add lotus seed and  sugar  (plus tapioca and  rice  balls if you choose to), cook until soup thickens a little and  lotus seeds  are tender, but not mushy (20 minutes). 
 Add  vanilla , serve hot for a perfect winter dessert, or you can let the soup cool down, then add  ice . 
 With this basic recipe, you can take out all the beans, increase the amount of  lotus seeds  and have a  lotus seeds  sweet soup instead.
