 In dry heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, toast chilies over medium heat until fragrant, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Remove from heat; cool. Tear chilies into small pieces, discarding any remaining seeds. Set aside.
 
 In large heavy saucepan, heat 2 teaspoons  oil  over medium heat. Add  Onion  and cook, stirring often, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add  garlic ,  cumin  and  oregano  and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add  tomatoes , broth,  molasses  and reserved chilies; increase heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove from heat; cool slightly.
 
 In blender or food processor, in batches, puree  tomato  mixture until smooth. Pass mixture through fine-meshed sieve into bowl. Set aside.
 
 In Dutch oven or deep saut√© pan, heat remaining 2 teaspoons  oil  over medium-high heat. Add both  bell peppers ,  zucchini  and  corn ; season with  salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened, about 4 minutes. Add  black beans  and reserved  tomato  mixture; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in  vinegar . Just before serving, garnish with  cilantro ,  lime  wedges and  avocado  if desired.
