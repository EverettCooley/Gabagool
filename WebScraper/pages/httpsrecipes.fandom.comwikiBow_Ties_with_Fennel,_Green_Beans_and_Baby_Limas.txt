Ingredients : 
 1 Tbsp  olive oil 
 1 medium  onion , chopped 
 ½ medium  bulb fennel , chopped (1 cup) 
 4 medium cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 Tbsp  fennel seeds , lightly crushed 
 3 cups low-sodium  vegetable broth 
 1 cup frozen  baby lima beans 
 6 oz  green beans , trimmed and halved (1½ cups) 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 ¾ cup canned crushed  tomatoes 
 ½ cup  Kalamata , rinsed, halved and pitted 
 ⅓ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf  parsley 
 ½ tsp freshly ground  pepper 
 12 oz dried  bow-tie pasta  ( farfalle ) 
 ½ cup freshly grated  Parmesan cheese  (2 oz; optional) 
 Directions : 
 Bring large pot of lightly salted  water  to a boil. 
 Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet, heat  oil  over medium-high heat. Add  onion  and  fennel  and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add  garlic  and  fennel seeds  and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in broth and  lima beans  and bring to a simmer. 
 Stir in  green beans  and  salt , reduce heat to medium and simmer until all beans are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
 Add  tomatoes  and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Stir in  parsley  and  pepper . 
 Shortly before sauce is ready, add  bow ties  to boiling  water ; stir to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring often, until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and place in large warm serving bowl. 
 Add bean mixture and toss to coat. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan if desired.
