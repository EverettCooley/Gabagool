 Description : 
 Made of butter, lemon and parsley,  meunière  is one of the simplest sauces there is. It's typically served with fish that has been lightly floured and then sautéed for a light, flavorful, elegant dish that's easy to make.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Striper Bass filets 
 Lemon, clairifed butter, parsley 
 Directions : 
 Heat a sauté pan over medium heat for a minute, then add a couple of tablespoons of clarified butter. 
 Season the fish fillet to taste with Kosher salt and just a  tiny  amount of ground white pepper. 
 Dredge the fish lightly in flour and shake off any excess. 
 Gently place the floured fillet into the hot pan. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until there's a nice golden-brown color, then carefully flip it over. Cook for another four or five minutes or until this side is golden-brown, too. 
 Remove fish from pan and place it on a warm plate. 
 Add a chunk of whole butter to the pan and swirl it around. Cook until it turns slightly brown. 
 Now add a few tablespoons of lemon juice and some chopped parsley to the hot butter. Cook for just a few seconds, letting it bubble a bit, then pour onto the fish and serve right away. Garnish with a thin slice of lemon if you like.
