 Method for  pickled onions

 2) Leave it at room temp for a day or two. Or place in the refrigerator for up to a week.
 
 Method for Liver Plate 
 1) Saute the  onions  in olive  oil  until the  onions  begin to caramelize as shown. The  pickled onions  will not lose all of their crunch. Don't forget to season with  salt .
 2) Season the liver with  salt  and  pepper  and brown. I did this in batches
 3) Puree in a blender or food processor* until smooth, taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. I added more olive  oil  for a lighter, mousse like consistency and for the flavor.
 4) Serve with flatbread or croutons.
