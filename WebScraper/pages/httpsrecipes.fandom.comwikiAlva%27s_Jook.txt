 Description : 
 Turkey-style soup
 
 Ingredients : 
 20 lb  turkey  with 95 percent of the meat stripped from it 
 4  celery  stalks, chopped, plus the  celery tops 
 1 large chopped round  onion  or two medium  onions 
 4 - 5 slices of fresh  ginger  (about Â¼-inch thick), peeled 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 large cans of Swansons clear  chicken  soup 
 1 bunch  parsley , bottom stems cut off 
 extra  water  or  chicken  soup to cover  turkey meat  and bones while simmering 
 2 cups  medium-grain raw Oriental rice , such as Hinode 
 1 tsp  Chinese five-spice powder 
 1 tsp dried  cilantro 
 1 tbsp  sesame oil 
 3 medium  carrots , chopped 
 1 head  Chinese mustard cabbage , chopped into bite-sized pieces 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 garlic salt , optional 
 Directions : 
 Put the carcass in the pot with the first 6 items and cover bones with the liquid. 
 Heat on high until the soup comes to a full boil. 
 Lower heat and medium simmer with the lid on, until most of the meat scraps fall off the carcass, about 3 hours. 
 Then, using a slotted spoon or strainer, take all the bones and the rest of the solids out (not the  turkey meat ) and discard them. 
 After their removal, add the  rice ,  Chinese five-spice powder , dried  cilantro ,  sesame oil , and  carrots . 
 Let the soup cook, covered, for at least another 30 minutes or more, simmering on on low heat, until the  rice  is fully cooked and the soup starts to thicken (let it thicken). 
 Add the bite-sized, sliced  mustard cabbage  and cook for 5 more minutes, then serve. 
 Serve in bowls and add thinly chopped  green onion  and minced  Chinese parsley  over the top as a garnish. 
 Grated fresh  ginger  may be served on the side.
