 Description : 
 This is what happens when you play "Round the World" - you find some really interesting recipes from distant places. Remind me to go to West Africa one day; they already have some of the world's best music and now they show that they can cook too. Looking forward to trying this in the future. I'm not sure about the servings - this looks so good that I guess that in our house it would feed the 2.5 of us. A  yellow melon  is also suggested as a substitute for the  mango  if this is not available.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 mangoes, cubes 
 1/2  pineapple , fresh,cubed 
 1/2 cup  lemon juice 
 1 cup  apricot  nectar or  orange juice 
 lettuce 
 strawberries , for garnish

 In a 2-quart bowl: Add the  pineapple  to the  mango . 
 Blend the juices separately and then pour over the  mango .
