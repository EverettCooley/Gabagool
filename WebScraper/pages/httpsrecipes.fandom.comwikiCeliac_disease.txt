A disease or condition relating to the inflammation of the small intestine. Sensitivity to gluten occurs in individuals having a specific genetic makeup so they are unable to easily digest wheat or wheat products, which contain the protein gluten. For some individuals, the small intestine becomes inflamed resulting in a decrease of the absorptive surface area, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, a general feeling of weakness, possible weight loss, and other related problems. Although not all people experience the same symptoms, if sensitivity to wheat products is suspected, it is wise to seek medical assistance and advice. Individuals with this disease are typically restricted to a gluten free diet, eating foods that do not contain gluten. This disease may also be referred to as celiac sprue.
