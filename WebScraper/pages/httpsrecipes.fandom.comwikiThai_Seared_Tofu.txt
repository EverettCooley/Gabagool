       Thai Seared Tofu     
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh  basil 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh  cilantro 
 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce 
 1/2 cup fresh  lime juice 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh  mint 
 2 tablespoons  molasses 
 1 tablespoon peeled minced  fresh ginger 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 2 teaspoons  curry  powder 
 1/2 teaspoon  crushed red pepper  flakes 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 (10.5 ounces) packages  firm tofu , drained  cooking spray 
 6 cups cooked  vermicelli  (about 12 oz. uncooked  Pasta ) 
 Directions : 
 Combine first 11 ingredients in a large baking dish; stir with a whisk until blended. 
Cut each  tofu  cake crosswise into 4 slices. 
Place  tofu  slices in soy sauce mixture, turning to coat slices. 
Cover and marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours. 
Remove  tofu  slices from dish, reserving marinade. 
Coat a large nonstick skillet with  cooking spray ; place over medium high heat. 
Add  tofu  slices; cook 2 minutes on each side. 
Remove from skillet; set aside, and keep warm. 
Add reserved marinade to skillet; bring to a simmer. 
Spoon noodles onto individual plates; top with  tofu  slices. 
Drizzle marinade over  tofu  and noodles. 
Yield: 4 servings.
 
 Variation 
 I sometimes like to coat the  tofu  with  cornstarch  (after marinating) and fry the  tofu  until it gets crispy on the outside, then procede with recipe.
