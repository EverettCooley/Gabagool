Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1 large  red onion , quartered and thinly sliced 
 1 large  white  or  yellow onion , quartered and thinly sliced 
 12-inch good-quality prepared pizza crust 
 4 to 6 ounces organic  smoked mozzarella  or sharp  cheddar cheese , grated 
 Directions : 
 Heat the oil in a large skillet. 
 Add the onions and saute slowly, covered, until translucent. 
 Uncover and continue to saute until they are nicely golden (but not browned), stirring often. 
 Arrange the onions on the pizza crust, then sprinkle the cheese evenly over the onions. 
 Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. 
 Cut into wedges and serve at once. 
 Notes : 
 Serves: 2 to 3 
 Serve this with a salad of mixed greens, cannellini (large white beans), and ripe tomatoes. A good wine adds to the charm of this meal as well.
