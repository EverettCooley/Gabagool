 Description : 
 When a  Fish Pyramid with Green Sauce  was served to us we thought the dish was such a great idea, we decided to suggest it as an additional dish you may want to serve at your Sudanese dinner. It is very easy to make. It can be served as a salad in place of the Salata.

 1/4 cup PICKLE RELISH. 
 2 HARD BOILED  eggs 
 2  tomatoes  cut in slices 
 1/4 cup  black olives 
 4 or 5  parsley  SPRIGS
