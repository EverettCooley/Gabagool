 Description : 
 Lithuanian Honey Liqueur
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 teaspoons  caraway seed 
 10 whole  cloves 
 10 whole  allspice 
 4 sticks  cinnamon 
 2 sticks  vanilla 
 2 pieces  yellow ginger 
 2 pieces white  ginger 
 10  cardamom  seeds 
 Â½  nutmeg 
 3 strips  orange rind 
 3 strips  lemon rind 
 1 pinch  saffron 
 4 cups  water 
 2 lbs  honey 
 1 quart  grain alcohol 
 Directions : 
 Crack  cardamon  seeds and  nutmeg . 
 Boil spices, rind and  water  in a covered pot until liquid is reduced to about 2 cups. 
 Strain. 
 In a pot large enough to hold the spiced liquid, alcohol and honey, bring honey to a boil. 
 Skim off the foam. 
 Pour spiced liquid into honey and stir. 
 Remove from heat. 
 Place far away from heat to prevent flare-up or expolsion of alcohol. 
 Slowly, and very carefully, pour in alcohol. 
 Replace pot on low heat. 
 Heat, being careful not to simmer or boil, for 15 minutes. 
 Remove from heat and let cool in the same covered pot overnight. 
 Following day, pour into bottles and allow to settle (about 2 weeks). 
 The longer it sits, the clearer it becomes and the better it tastes.
