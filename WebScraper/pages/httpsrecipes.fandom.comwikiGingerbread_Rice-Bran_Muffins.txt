Description : 
 This recipe is from the  8-Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook  by Robert E. Kowalski, pg 290. The only change I made was 2 tbsp  corn syrup  instead of 2 tbsp  canola oil . Oh, and this is the only fat-free muffin recipe I have made where the muffins don't stick to the paper cups when you eat them right out of the oven!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ cup  rice bran 
 ¼ cup  raisins 
 ¾ cup  all-purpose flour  or  whole wheat flour 
 ½ cup hot  water 
 1½ tbsp  baking powder 
 ¾ cup  molasses 
 ¾ tbsp  ginger 
 2 tbsp  corn syrup 
 ¾ tbsp  cinnamon 
 2  egg whites 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 425°F. 
 Mix dry ingredients, including  raisins , together in a large bowl. 
 Mix moist ingredients in a blender and then add to dry ingredients. 
 Pour batter into muffin pans lined with paper baking cups. 
 Bake about 13 minutes.
