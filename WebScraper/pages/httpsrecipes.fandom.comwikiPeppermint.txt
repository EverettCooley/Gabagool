      Peppermint     
 Scientific Name of Plant : 
 Mentha piperita
 
 Description : 
 One of the oldest varieties of mint and the most important for industrial use as a flavoring or to create a scented aroma. Menthol oil is produced from the deep green, oval-shaped hairy leaves through steam distillation. Its initial taste is burning, somewhat peppery or spicy and then it becomes refreshing and very aromatic. Peppermint is used to add aroma to essences and flavor to liqueurs and candies. It is also used to produce flavoring that can be used for baking, but not often in home baking.
