      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Stuck for cooking ideas on a Friday or Saturday evening? Got bits of vegetable in your fridge that aren't quite enough for a proper cookout? e.g. bits of green or red pepper - or some  Mushrooms . Or maybe you've got some frozen in your freezer that you haven't done anything with for weeks?
 Why not try pakoras? This is a great afternoon snack sort of thing - that I remember for many years as a child we would eat as a full meal on occasions. And we still do this today in the Route79 household. It's basically deep-fried anything in a gram- flour  batter - but is especially delicious when using sliced  potatoes ,  onions , muchrooms,  peppers  - or even chunks of frozen (but thawed) fillet.
 It is traditionally a Punjabi snack - and is almost always served in addition to things like samosas, kebabs etc. when you are entertaining visitors (or being entertained round someones house) - or attending a wedding. Be aware - if you you are ever visiting a Punjabi household - you will be obliged to eat your fill and drink lots of tea - or else your hosts will be offended. Never *ever* just "pop around" and expect to get away without spending at least an hour - and having a plate full of samosas or pakoras put in front of you.
 Pakoras are delicious served with  mint  or imli ( tamarind ) sauce - or both.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Some vegetables - e.g. 4 or 5  potatoes  - or some chopped bitesize  peppers ) or whole or halved  Mushrooms .
 
 1 or large  onions  chopped into long thin strips 
 A packet of skinless, boneless frozen fillets (e.g. cod) - thawed about halfway 
 A pot half-full of  sunflower oil . 
 For the batter:
 
 6 tablespoons of " gram flour " - which is  chickpea flour  (sometimes called "besan") 
 Chunks of frozen, pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and green-chillie 
 Spices:  turmeric  (haldi),  garam masala , Ground Coriander,  salt , Chillie powder 
 Some  cumin  and  ajwan  seed ( ajwan  seed is like carraway - or  oregano  seed - you don't have to use it you cannot find it - but it does impart a nice flavour) 
 Here is a picture of all the other spices. Look how wonderful and tempting they all are when they are gathered together like this on your worktop!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 First prepare the  flour  mix. Sift the besan  flour  into a large bowl.
 Also slice the  potatoes  from the long-end of the  Potato  - into 0.5 centimetre slices. chunks if you are using them should be bite-sized - e.g. size of small  Mushroom  say.  Mushrooms  should be whole or halved.
 Now add the spices to the  gram flour  bowl:
 
 4 heaped teaspoons of  garam masala 
 2 heaped teaspoons of  salt 
 3 heaped teaspoons of ground coriander 
 2 heaped teaspoons of red chillie powder 
 all the pulped  ginger , chillie and  garlic 
 3 teaspoons of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 Basically - you have to use more spices than you normally do for a  curry  because these will only be in the batter - and you will probably not use all of the batter anyway - as there might be some leftover that you have to throw away.
 Then add about a tall glass of  water  to the  flour /spice mixture - stirring all the time with a large spoon (or your hand) until you get a thick-soup style consistency - with no  flour  lumps in it. Add a few dashes of  lemon juice  to it at this point too.
 
         Put all spices (except seeds) into flour and mix it all up     
         Stir in a tall glass of water mixing toroughly until batter is thick-soup consistency     
 Then - if you have some - throw in some chopped  coriander leaf  too. We have a bag of frozen chopped coriander in our freezer - and we just throw in a large chunk straight from the freezer - as it thaws pretty much instantly. Then stir in all the vegetables and/or chunks. It doesn't matter if the chunks are still half-frozen - as this is probably better - because it's easier to cut and handle - and it cooks in no time at all anyway.
 
         Add some chopped coriander if you have some     
         Then add the potato slices or bit-sized fish chunks or whatever you like. Make sure everything is well coated     
 OK - once all the stuff is mixed - put the bowl to one side and heat up the karahi of  oil  until the  oil  is very hot. You will know when it's done by dropping a little of the batter mix into the  oil  and if it solidifies instantly and floats on the top of the  oil  with lots of bubbles - then you know it's hot enough for deep frying. At this point lower the flame a little - and then add the  potatoes  etc using your hand - scooping up some of the batter around it - and drop gently into the hot  oil . Do the frying in 4 or 5 batches - making sure you turn up the heat to keep everything bubbling and floating on the surface for around 4 or 5 minutes at a time - and using a metal utensil like the one in the picture to turn over the frying objects.
 
         Heat a large karahi (pot) with vegetable oil in it - just above halfway full - until hot     
         Add the coted veg/fish - in batches and fry until golden brown     
 After a few mins of frying (when the batter coating has gone golden brown) scoop out the fried onjects and drain well on absorbent kitchen paper before putting into a foil-lined dish - which you can keep in a low-temperature oven to stay warm whilst you cook the rest. When it's all done - turn off the heat to the  oil  - and keep covered - as you can reuse this  oil  - but you must strain it first using a funnel and strainer - but only when it is fully cooled! If you have used - then you might not wish to use the  oil  - as it will have a fishy smell that you may not like when you are using the  oil  again in any other cooking!
 
         Serve in a foil/tissue lined dish - keep warm in oven. When all of it is fried - eat
