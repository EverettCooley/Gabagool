 Million Dollar Spoon Cake
  
 
 
 
    1 Deep Dish Lasagna Tin Pan  (the disposable kind) 
 1 Betty Crocker super moist Carrot Cake mix 
 2 Cans (20 Oz.) of crushed pineapple
 1 Apple
 1 Carrot
 2 tubs of Cool Whip
 3 pkg. of Instant Cream Cheese pudding mix
 3 � C. of milk
 3 Lg. eggs 
 � C. of Oil
 1 C. of pineapple juice
 
 
 
  Open cans of pineapple and put them in a strainer over a bowl and let them drain very well. Set aside and save the juice. Grate or in a mini chopper the apple and carrot, set aside. 
 In a bowl put in 3 lg. eggs, then the cake mix, � C. of oil, now add 1 C. pineapple juice (from the pineapples that are draining), mix all of this until well blended, when done add the chopped apple and carrot fold this in with a rubber spatula, then pour into the pan you will have to spread this around with spatula to get it in the corners and bake for 30 minutes. 
 When cake is done let it cool completely (I put mine in the fridge for about 15 minutes)
 Now in a bowl (I use the same bowl from the cake mix after it has been washed out) add the 3 boxes of pudding mix and add the 3 � C of milk. Beat with electric mixer on high until thickened about 10 min. When this is done spread this on the cake. 
 Now add the very well drained pineapple spread evenly. Then add cool whip.. Decorate the top of the Cool Whip in any way you like.
  
 Refrigerate over night is best. Do not cut this cake use a big serving spoon to dish this out. Hence the name Spoon Cake. 
  
 Enjoy!!
