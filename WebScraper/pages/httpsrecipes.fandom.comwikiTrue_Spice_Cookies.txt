Description : 
 
 Mace and nutmeg are derived from the fruit of the same tree, Myristica fragrans, Mace is the thin, bright-red, lacelike covering over the shell of the nutmeg. Its flavor is similar to nutmeg's, but more delicate; if you don't have it on hand, substitute ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.
 For best results, the dough should chill for 8 to 12 hours in the refrigerator.
 STORE: In an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. The dough may be wrapped well and refrigerated for up to 5 days. Freeze the baked cookies in a heavy-duty resealable plastic food storage bag for 2 to 4 months.
