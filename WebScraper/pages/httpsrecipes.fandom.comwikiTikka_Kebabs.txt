Ingredients : 
 2 lbs boneless meat (preferably from  butter  fried leg of  Lamb , cut into 2" cubes) 
 2 tbsp  garam masala 
 2 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1 small  onion , chopped 
 1 tbsp chopped  fresh ginger 
 5  garlic flakes 
 1 tsp ground  cayenne pepper 
 4 tbsp  sour cream 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Puree all the ingredients, except the  Lamb , together in a blender. 
 Pierce the cubes of  lamb  with a thick skewer or sharp knife, so that a visible hole is made in the meat. 
 The idea is to allow the meat to marinate properly, which is the entire secret of the recipe. 
 Place the above puree in the hole of the meat and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. 
 When you are ready to cook, place the kebabs in a broiler pan to drain off excess juices. 
 Heat the oven to a full broil for 15 minutes and place the kebabs in the oven. 
 Broil for about 15 minutes and remove from the oven. Turn the pieces over and broil for another 15 minutes. 
 Sprinkle some fresh  coriander leaves  and serve hot.
