Quick, fresh and so simple to make with a food processor. Its flavor is meant to be refreshing to offset other spicy hot dishes such as stews or grilled meat and it goes well with any bread. This is an Ethiopian recipe coming from Alford's and Duguid's cookbook on " Flatbreads and Flavours ".
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  green bell pepper , very fresh 
 1 medium  garlic  clove, coarsely chopped 
 ⅛ teaspoon  salt  (to taste) 
 1  jalapeño chile , seeded and diced (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Wash the  bell pepper  and coarsely chop, removing core,seeds and membranes. 
 Put  pepper ,  garlic  and  salt  in the food processor fitted with a blade and scraping down the sides of the bowl repeatedly with a rubber spatula, process until rather smooth. 
 Taste and serve with spicy meat and bread. If you prefer some heat to the relish add as much of the diced  chile  as you like.
