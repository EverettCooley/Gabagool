 Wikipedia Article  About Natto on Wikipedia 
 Nattō (納豆, Nattō?) is a traditional Japanese food product made from fermented soybeans, popular especially at breakfast. A rich source of protein, nattō and the soybean paste miso formed a vital source of nutrition in feudal Japan. With an acquired taste due to its powerful smell and sticky consistency, in Japan nattō is most popular in the eastern Kanto region.
