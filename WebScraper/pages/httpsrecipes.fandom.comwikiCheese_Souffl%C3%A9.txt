Description : 
       Cheese Soufflé     
 A soufflé should be served immediately as it starts to collapse a few minutes after removing from the oven.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup grated  Parmesan cheese , divided (about 2 ounces) 
 4 tablespoons  unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons Atkins Quick Quisine™  Bake Mix 
 2 tablespoons whole wheat  pastry flour 
 ¾ cup  heavy cream 
 ¾ cup  water 
 2 cups  cheddar  cheese, grated (about 8 ounces) 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ⅛ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 6 large  eggs , separated 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Grease a two-quart soufflé dish and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons  parmesan cheese . 
 Set aside. 
 Melt  butter  in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. 
 Stir in soy and pastry flours and mix well. 
 Slowly add  heavy cream  and  water , whisking constantly. 
 Stir in remaining Parmesan,  cheddar ,  salt  and  cayenne . 
 Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. 
 Remove from heat and whisk in  egg yolks , one at a time. 
 Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. 
 With an electric mixer in high speed, beat whites until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. 
 Using a rubber spatula, fold whites into  cheese  mixture in three additions. 
 Gently pour soufflé mixture into prepared dish and bake on center rack for 40 to 45 minutes, until a skewer inserted in middle comes out clean and soufflé is completely risen and browned. 
 Serve immediately.
