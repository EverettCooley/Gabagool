 Directions : 
 This comes from adele davis" let"s cook it right: soaking legumes is unnecessary if the dry legume is quickly washed and dropped into boiling  water  so slowly that boiling does not stop. As in popping  corn , the starch  grains  burst and break the outside covering of the legume. After the covering and starch  grains  have burst,  water  is absorbed rapidly and the cooking time is shortened. When all the beans,  Lentils , or split  Peas  have been put into the  water , the heat should be lowered immediately to prevent the protein from becoming tough. A simmering temperature should then be maintained until the beans are tender. It works for me; i"ve found cooking times to be *significantly* reduced
