 Makes 4 sandwiches 
 Ingredients : 
 4 tablespoons  butter 
 4 teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard 
 4 teaspoons pressed fresh  garlic 
 8 slices extra-sour  sourdough bread , about inch thick 
 6 ounces  fontina  cheese 
 6 ounces  mozzarella  cheese 
 4 tablespoons shredded  parmesan ,  asiago  or  pecorino romano  cheese 
 4 tablespoons thinly sliced  scallions 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the grill. If you have a grill with a variable temperature control, set it to medium-high (1 or 2 steps below high) or to about 350°F to 400°F. 
 In a small saucepan melt the butter over low heat. When the butter is melted, whisk in the mustard and garlic. Set aside. 
 Grate the three different types of cheeses into a small bowl and combine with a fork. 
 Put 4 slices of sourdough bread on a large plate. Put 1 tablespoon of scallions on each slice. Place a layer of cheese over the scallions, dividing equally among the 4 slices. Place a slice of sourdough over the cheese and brush the garlic-mustard-butter baste on top. 
 Carefully put each sandwich, basted side down, on the grill. 
 Brush the tops of each sandwich evenly with the remaining garlic- mustard-butter baste. 
 For a 2-sided contact grill: grill a total of 3 to 4 minutes. For a hibachi grill, combination grill or infusion grill: grill a total of 6 to 8 minutes (3 to 4 minutes on each side), remove from grill and serve.
