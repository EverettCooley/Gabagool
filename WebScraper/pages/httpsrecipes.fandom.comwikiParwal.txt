 About Parwal : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Parwal on Wikipedia 
 Trichosanthes dioica is also known as the pointed gourd, parwal (from Hindi), or potol (from Bengali). Colloquially, in India, it is often called green potato. It is widely cultivated in the eastern part of India, particularly in Bengal, Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. It is a good source of carbohydrates, vitamin A, and vitamin C. It also contains major nutrients and trace elements (magnesium, potassium, copper, sulphur, and chlorine) which are needed in small quantities, for playing essential roles in human physiology.
 It is a perennial fruit, similar to cucumber and squash. It is a dioecious (male and female plants) vine (creeper) plant with heart-shaped leaves (cordate) and is grown on a trellis. The fruits are green with white or no stripes. Size can vary from small and round to thick and long â€” 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm). It thrives well under a hot to moderately warm and humid climate. The plant remains dormant during the winter season and prefers a fertile, well-drained sandy loam soil due to its susceptibility to water-logging.
 It is used as ingredients of soup, stew, curry, sweet, or eaten fried and as dorma with roe stuffing.
 Also see trichosanthes, gourd.
