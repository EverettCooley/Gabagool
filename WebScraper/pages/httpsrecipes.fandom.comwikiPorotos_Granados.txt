 Description : 
 This recipe is Chilean. Can't wait to try this myself. It's from a special edition of Saveur, The Best of Tex-Mex Cooking. They recommend you use 2 cups dried  navy beans  soaked overnight, but I've altered the recipe and cooking time for canned. I also halved the amount of  oil .
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1 tablespoon sweet  paprika 
 1 medium  yellow onion , peeled and chopped 
 1 (15 ounce) can  navy beans , drained 
 3¼ cups  vegetable broth 
 3 cups  winter squash , peeled and cubed (like  pumpkin ,  butternut  or  acorn ) 
 1½ cups  lima beans  (fresh or frozen) 
 1½ cups  corn  kernels (2 ears fresh or frozen) 
 2 tablespoons fresh  basil , chopped 
 salt  and  black pepper , to taste 
 Directions : 
 Heat  oil  in large pot over medium-low heat. Stir in  paprika , then add  onions  and cook until soft, about 15 minutes. 
 Add  navy beans  and broth to pot, then add  winter squash  and  lima beans . Cover and simmer over low heat until  squash  begins to soften, about 30 minutes. Add up to ¼ cup  water  if mixture becomes too dry. 
 Stir  corn  and  basil  into pot and cook, uncovered, until the  corn  is tender and sauce is thick, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper .
