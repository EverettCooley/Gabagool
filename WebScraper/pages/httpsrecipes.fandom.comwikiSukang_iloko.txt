Sukang iloko, which is made from the naturally fermented sugar canes, has a strong, acidic scent and turbid color quality distinctive of other vinegars. Its unique taste complements mouth-watering delicacies such as  adobo ,  paksiw ,  longganisa , and a perfect match for  empanada .       A bottle of Sukang Iloko
