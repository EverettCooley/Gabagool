      Cookie press     
 A  cookie press  (aka  cookie gun ) is a tool used to form professional-looking pressed tubes. It is made up of a tube with a decorative template or nozzle attached at one end and a plunger attached at the other. The templates and tips are sold with the plunger. When the tube is filled with cookie tough, the plunger is used to push the dough through the tip.  Spritz  are the best known cookies made using a cookie press.
