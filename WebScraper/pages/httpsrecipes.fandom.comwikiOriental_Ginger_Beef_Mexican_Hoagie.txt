Description : 
       Oriental Ginger Beef Mexican Hoagie     
 How do I name it? It's a Chat driven combination. Yeah RRRiiight. Fusion cooking at it's most insane. The tastes worked well together.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  pickled ginger  or 2 – 3 inches  gingerroot , sliced as thin as possible 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ⅓ cup  mirin 
 ⅓ teaspoon  sugar  (or if you don't have it ⅓ cup Japanese  rice wine vinegar  and 1½ tsp  sugar ) 
 pico de gallo  (salsa fresca) or any light tasting  salsa , with 1 teaspoon  lime juice 
 ½ lb of very thinly cross-grain not fatty sliced  beef  (rib eye, rump, round, I suspect even brisket. if you are lucky enough to have an eastern rim type ma) 
 1 – 2  kaiser rolls  or hoagie rolls 
 2 – 4 slices  Monterey jack   pepper   cheese 
 a bit of  sweet hot mustard  (I liked it) (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Marinate the  beef  well mixed with the sushi  ginger  in a refrigerator box overnight. 
 In a very lightly oiled very very hot griddle or one of those round hump topped mongolian bbq stovetop grills. 
 Grill the meat both sides. 
 It will be a matter of seconds per side. 
 Split the roll. 
 Load the bottom half liberally with the pico de gallo. 
 Pile on the still hot  beef . 
 Top with *sufficient* pepper jack. 
 Spread the optional sweet hot  mustard  (not a lot as it shouldn't take over). 
 Enjoy, i had a bottle kirin with mine.
