Classic Ethiopian chicken stew (tofu can be substituted for the chicken)
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large fryer  chicken  (or 2 pounds  firm tofu ) 
 olive oil  for frying 
 1 stick of  butter  or soy  margarine 
 1½ large  onions , coarsely chopped 
 4 large cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1 can (6 ounce)  tomato paste 
 2 up to 3 tbsp  berbere  seasoning 
 salt  to taste 
 3 up to 6 hard-boiled  eggs , peeled (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Cut apart the  chicken  (to avoid small bones, do not use backs or necks); remove skin and make slits in the meat. 
 If you're using  tofu , cut it into 2-inch cubes, then boil the cubes in a covered pot for 5 to 10 minutes until they puff up and become spongy; this enables the  tofu  to absorb the sauce. 
 Rinse in cold  water  and drain. 
 Heat a few tablespoons of  olive oil  in a Dutch oven or skillet. 
 Add  butter  or  margarine , melt, then add the  onions . 
 Cook over medium heat until somewhat soft, then add  garlic . 
 When  onions  are translucent, stir in  tomato paste  and about ¼ cup of  water . 
 Strain the  berbere  and add it to the mixture. 
 Add  salt . 
 Put the  chicken  or  tofu  in the pot, coat with the sauce, and cover. 
 Simmer, stirring often to make sure the sauce doesn't stick or burn; add  water  as necessary to keep the sauce the consistency of thick ketchup. 
 If you're using  eggs  (traditional in doro wat), add them whole to the mixture after 30 minutes. 
 Simmer on the stove top about one hour. 
 The sauce should be a rich, deep red. 
 When the dish is done, hold in a warm oven until ready to serve.
