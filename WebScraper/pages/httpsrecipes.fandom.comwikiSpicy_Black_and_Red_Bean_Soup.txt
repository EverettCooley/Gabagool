Desription : 
 Vegetables lightly sautéed are combined with Mexican-style stewed  tomatoes , green chilies and  corn  in this recipe using canned black and  kidney beans .
 I see no reason for  white sugar  in this dish... just leave it out... or use Splenda if you wish. It is also a good fiber dish... too bad the recipe did not include this and other nutritional info. Take Care, Gloria
