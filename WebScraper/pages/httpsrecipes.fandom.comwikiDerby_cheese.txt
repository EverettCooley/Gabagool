 About Derby cheese : 
 Derby cheese is a mild, semi-firm cow's milk cheese with a smooth, mellow texture and buttery flavour. It has a pale, golden orange interior with a natural or waxed rind. It is quite similar in taste and texture to Cheddar and ripens at between one and six months. The most common variety available is the herb-flavored Derby that has the traditional light ivory/yellow colour with blended light green areas of herbs, such as Sage Derby.
 
 Little Derby : 
 Little Derby is a Derby-style cheese made outside Derbyshire, similar in flavour and texture to  Cheddar , but without the anatto colouring used in Derby cheese.
