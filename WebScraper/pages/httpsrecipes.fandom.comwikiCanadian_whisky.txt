 Wikipedia Article  About Canadian whisky on Wikipedia 
 Canadian whisky is whisky made in Canada; by law it must be aged there at least three years in a barrel. Most Canadian whiskies are blended multi-grain whiskies (a blend of rye, corn, wheat and barley is smoother and lighter than its cousins, rye and bourbon). These are often casually called "rye whisky" although they contain proprietary blends of corn (maize), barley, and rye.
 Canadian whisky featured prominently in illegal imports (known as bootlegging) into the U.S. during Prohibition in the 1920s. Hiram Walker and Seagram's have distilleries in Windsor, Ontario across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan that easily served small, fast smuggling boats. The long mainly unpatrolled U.S.-Canadian border made smuggling fairly easy.
