 Guacamole can be made with avocado and asparagus and other fruits that Mexicans love for appetizers are kiwis, berries for the sweet flavor and lemon. The avocado is used for many sauces to flavor the appetizers. Tortilla chips with dipping sauce made with jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes or mango salsa, chili cheese dip, seven layer dip, beefy bean dip, salsa ninety nine, chipotle peach salsa with cilantro, bean or roasted pepper dip. The range of salsas and dipping sauces is amazingly wide and it varies from mild dips to unbearably hot ones. Taco is a favorite appetizer: taco pie, taco sandwich, taco treat, taco nachos with the taco dip. The taco treat is made with corn tortillas, soft cream cheese, diced jalapeno peppers, black olives and taco seasoning mix. The taco sauce is served among others, with turkey nacho bake, which includes browned turkey meat, served with sour cream, salsa or guacamole.
