 Description : 
 I used  sour cream  in this recipe instead of the plain  yogurt  that is found in many dishes from western asia and the middle east. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs boneless skinless  chicken  breasts 
 1 large  onion 
 ½ lb baby  carrots 
 4 tablespoons  curry powder 
 1 tablespoon  Chinese five-spice powder  (optional) 
 2 cups  chicken broth 
 2 cups  sour cream 
 2 teaspoons  cornstarch 
 4 teaspoons  water 
 hot pepper   oil 
 crushed red pepper  flakes 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 whisk together  sour cream , broth,  curry  powder, 5 spice and  hot pepper   oil / crushed red pepper  in a large bowl. 
 Set aside. 
 Cut  chicken  into cubes or strips. 
 Slice  onion  into medium sized pieces. 
 cut the  carrots  if you want to also. 
 Place  chicken ,  carrots  and  onion  into a large pot on the stove. 
 Pour broth mixture into pot, gently stirring ingredients together. 
 bring almost to boiling over medium high heat, the reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 1 hour to 1.5 hours stirring occasionally until  chicken  is cooked through and  carrots  and  onions  have reached desired tenderness. 
 During the last 10 minutes of cooking, stir together the  cornstarch  and  water  thoroughly, and stir it into the pot. 
 This will thicken the sauce. 
 add  salt  and  pepper  to taste and serve over  sticky rice . 
 This can also be prepared in a crock pot or in a 4qt casserole dish in the oven. 
 If oven method is preferred, cook at 325 °F for 1 hour 20 minutes. 
 Stir in  cornstarch  mixture after cooking.
