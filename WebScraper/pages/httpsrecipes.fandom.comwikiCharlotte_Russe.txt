 Ingredients 
 40  ladyfingers 
 1 cup  whipped cream 
 Bavarian Cream 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 1½ cup  milk 
 1 x  gelatin  leaf, soaked in cold water 
 1½ cup  heavy cream , whipped 
 1 dash  salt 
 3 large  egg  yolks 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 2 tbsp  Maraschino (cherry) liquor 
 Directions 
 Pour milk into a large pot. 
 Add a pinch of salt, then bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. 
 Add the vanilla extract, remove from heat. 
 In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar until creamy. 
 Add a little bit of the vanilla milk to *temper* the eggs. About ¼ cup of milk is okay. 
 Pour the egg-milk mixture back into the pot with the rest of the milk. 
 Over gentle heat, cook the mixture to a rose - stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until it thickens. 
 The heat must not exceed 185 °F (82 °C). 
 Remove from heat, continue stirring. 
 Squeeze out the water from the gelatin leaf, then add the gelatin to the hot cream. 
 Stir until it dissolves. 
 Pour through a wire strainer (to make sure the mixture is smooth) into a stainless steel mixing bowl. 
 Place the bowl over crushed ice. Stir, until it starts to cool down and thicken. 
 Fold in the whipped heavy cream and maraschino. 
 Transfer to a round mold and chill until set.# This is the *charlotte*. 
 Unmold the charlotte on a serving dish. 
 Put a dollop of whipped cream at the flat side of the lady fingers, then press on the sides of the charlotte until completely surrounded by lady fingers. 
 Garnish with additional whipped cream and sliced fruit.
