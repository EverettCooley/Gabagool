Description : 
 These are best served with a  spaghetti  Sauce,I have used jazzed up jarred sauce and they are still great. However...meat-a-balls like these deserve a homemade sauce, in my opinion!
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs lean  ground beef 
 8 – 10 slices white bread, broken into small ½ inch pieces (or you can use rolls or any stale bread you have and want to use up) 
 2  eggs , slightly beaten 
 ½ teaspoon  garlic powder  (or to taste) 
 1 teaspoon  Italian seasoning  (or to taste) 
 2 teaspoons  parsley  flakes (or to taste) 
 ¼ – ½ cup grated  Parmesan cheese  ( or   locatelli ) 
 1 – 2 teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ – ½ teaspoon  black pepper 
 olive oil   or   vegetable oil  (for frying) 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients gently in a large bowl until well combined. 
 Roll meatballs 1½ - 1¾" in diameter. 
 Heat about ¼" of  oil  over medium heat in a large frying pan. 
 Fry meatballs in  oil , rolling frequently, until evenly browned and juices run clear. 
 Drop meatballs in your favorite sauce and let simmer for awhile to flavor sauce or just serve with your favorite  pasta  and sauce. 
 Tip: you can also bake or broil these if the frying part is too much of a hassle — I use my broiler pan if I bake them, so the fat drips down and away from the meatballs.
