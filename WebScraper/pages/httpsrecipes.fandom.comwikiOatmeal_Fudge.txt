Oatmeal Fudge
 
 
 Ingredients and directions : 
 1 Stick butter 
 2 cups Sugar 
 1/2 cup Milk 
 
Bring to boil and stir while boiling for 3 min. exactly. Remove from burner and add:
 
 1/2 cup Cocoa 
 2 cups Oatmeal 
 1/2 cup Coconut 
 1/2 cup Pecans 
 1 t Vanilla 
 1 pinch salt 
 Mix quickly and spoon out onto wax paper.
 
 Make sure you get all of your ingredients together first because you must mix the second half of the stuff in as soon as you take the boiling mixture off the stove. It really is good and very sweet. I usually make just a half recipe.
 
 Happy cooking! Enjoy.
