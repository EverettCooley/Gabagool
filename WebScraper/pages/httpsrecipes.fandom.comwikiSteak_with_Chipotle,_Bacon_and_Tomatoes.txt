 Ingredients : 
 1 or more dried  chipotle  chilies 
 2 tablespoons extra virgin  olive oil 
 ¼ cup minced  bacon 
 1 medium  onion , peeled and diced 
 2 cups cored and chopped  tomatoes , preferably fresh and ripe 
 1½ to 2 pounds strip  sirloin ,  skirt  or  rib-eye steak 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Start a charcoal or gas grill; fire should be quite hot, and rack about 4 inches from the heat source. 
 If using oven, turn it to its maximum temperature. 
 Put chipotle in a bowl, and add boiling water to cover. 
 Put olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; a minute later, add bacon, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. 
 Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, about 5 minutes. 
 Lower heat, stem and seed chipotle and add it (or a piece of it, to taste), along with tomatoes; adjust heat so mixture simmers steadily but not violently (reserve chipotle soaking liquid). 
 Season steaks with salt and pepper. 
 Grill about 4 minutes on a side, or until they reach desired degree of doneness. 
 If cooking steaks inside, heat a cast iron or other heavy skillet over high heat 3 to 4 minutes. 
 Add steak, and, a minute later, transfer pan to oven; turn after about 4 minutes, and continue to cook to the desired degree of doneness. 
 When tomatoes break up, taste sauce; add salt and pepper as needed and, if it is not hot enough, a bit of the chipotle-soaking liquid or reserved chipotle. 
 When steaks are done, serve them with sauce.
