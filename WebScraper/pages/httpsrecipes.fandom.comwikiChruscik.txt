       Chruscik     
 Makes 8 dozen. 
 Ingredients : 
 9  egg yolks 
 3 tbsp  sour cream 
 1 tbsp  rum 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 1  confectioners' sugar 
 3 cups  flour  (sifted) 
 ½ tsp  baking powder 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 3 tbsp  sugar 
 1  oil  for deep frying 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  egg yolks  with the sugar until well combined. 
 Add  sour cream ,  rum  and  vanilla  and mix until smooth. 
 Sift the  flour ,  baking powder  and  salt  and add it to  egg   yolk  mixture, a little at a time. 
 On a heavily floured surface knead the dough vigorously, punching and squeezing as much  flour  into it as it will take until the dough is no longer sticky (½ hour). 
 Separate dough into several portions and roll very thin. 
 Turn the dough and loosen often when rolling. 
 The dough should look like parchment paper that you can see through. 
 Cut dough into strips approx. 1½ inches wide, 4 inches long. 
 Make slit closer to one end and bring the longer end through the slit. 
 Heat  oil  to 375°F and fry quickly (only a few seconds) until golden not brown. 
 Turn only once. 
 Drain on paper towels. 
 Dust with confectioners  sugar .
