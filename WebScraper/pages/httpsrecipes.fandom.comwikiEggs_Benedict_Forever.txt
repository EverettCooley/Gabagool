 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  firm tofu 
 1/4 cup  apple cider vinegar 
 1/4 tsp  salt 
 1/4 cup  olive oil 
 2  English muffins 
 4 slices of veggie  Bacon

 1/2 cup  nutritional yeast 
 2 tbsp  flour 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 1 cup  water 
 1 tbsp  oil 
 1 tsp Braggs or soy sauce 
 1 tsp dijon  mustard 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 450. Drain  tofu  and cut into 8 slices. 
 In a small bowl, whisk together the  vinegar ,  oil  and  salt . 
 Arrange the  tofu  in a 6 X 9 baking dish and pour the  oil  and  vinegar  mixture over top. 
 Marinate for 15-30 minutes. Make sure to turn the  tofu  over occasionally so each side gets marinated. 
 Bake for 20 minutes or until crispy brown... you might want to dump out the excess liquid for the last few minutes of baking if it's not getting very brown for you. 
 To prepare the sauce, whisk together the  yeast ,  flour , and  salt . 
 Add the  water ,  oil  and Braggs and stir over medium heat until the sauce thickens. 
 Stir in the  mustard  and simmer over low heat until ready to serve. 
 Toast the muffins. 
 On each slice of muffin, place 1 piece of  Bacon , 2  tofu  pieces,  tomato  slice and cover with the benny sauce.
