      Parsley-Stuffed Chicken     
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium  chicken 
 1½ – 2 lbs  sea salt 
 4 tablespoons  olive oil 
 3  garlic  cloves 
 3 slices  lemons , thin 
 1 bunch  parsley 
 1 teaspoon dried  oregano 
 ½ teaspoon dried  basil 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Separate skin from the body of the chicken. 
 In a bowl, mix olive oil, oregano, basil and salt. 
 Rub ¾ of the mixture between the skin and the meat of the chicken. 
 Rub the rest into the skin. 
 Put slices of lemon and cloves of garlic into the chicken. 
 Stuff the bunch of the parsley into chicken's rear, stalk first, press it in firmly so that as much parsley as possible would get inside. 
 You will still have a healthy bunch of leaves outside, that's fine. 
 Pour the sea salt onto the cooking sheet, spread evenly, like sand on the beach. 
 Place the chicken on the salt (with the back downwards). 
 Bake for about one hour or until the skin is nicely crispy.
