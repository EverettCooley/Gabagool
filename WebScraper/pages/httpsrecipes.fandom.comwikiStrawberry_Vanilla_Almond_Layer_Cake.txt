 Description : 
 Frost cake with  The Ultimate Whipped Vanilla-Almond Frosting 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 1/2 cups unbleached white  flour 
 2 1/4 cups  beet   Sugar 
 2 tbsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  salt 
 2 1/4 cups  soy milk  or other ' milk ' 
 2 tbsp  vanilla extract 
 3/4 cup light, natural  oil 
 Equivilant of 3  eggs , beaten 
 1/2 pint of fresh  strawberries 
 1/3 cup  sliced almonds 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 F. Prepare your pans by placing them on pieces of wax paper, tracing and cutting out the circle-shapes, and lining the bottom of the pans with the wax paper circles. 
 
 In large bowl, mix together  flour ,  Sugar ,  baking powder , and  salt .
 
 Combine remaining ingredients, and add to  flour  mixture. Beat for 2 minutes.
 
 Bake for 20–30 minutes (depending on your oven) or until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out dry. Please be careful not to let this cake overcook or it becomes quite dry. Allow to cool about ten minutes, then run a table knife around the edges to seperate them from the pan. Tap the cakes out of their pans onto a cooling rack, peel off the wax paper, and let cool completely before frosting.
 Wash, trim and slice the  strawberries  so that they look kind of like little hearts. Stick the slices onto the sides and top of the cake in a pretty pattern. Sprinkle the top of the cake with the  almonds .
 
 Chill this thoroughly before serving. You do not want to let this cake “sit out” for too long or the icing will soften and the cake with start to slide around.
