 Description : 
 Apricot balls. Use a natural, tart variety of  dried apricots , not the sweetened or honeyed ones. They must also be soft. These keep well for weeks and are good to serve with  coffee .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  dried apricots 
 confectioners' sugar 
 about 25 shelled  pistachios  to decorate 
 Directions : 
 Do not soak or wash the  apricots , or you will produce a  cream . 
 Put them as they are in the food processor and blend them to a smooth paste, adding a very little  water , by the teaspoon if necessary. 
 Wash your hands and, wetting them or greasing them with a little  oil  so the paste does not stick, take little lumps of paste and roll into marble-sized balls. 
 Roll them in  confectioners' sugar  and press half a pistachio on top of each. 
 Variation : 
 Mix ½ cup coarsely chopped pistachios with 2 tablespoons of sugar. 
 Make a small hole in the center of each  apricot  ball, put in a little of the filling, close the hole again, and roll in  confectioners' sugar . 
 Work ½ cup coarsely chopped pistachios into the  apricot  paste with your hands.
