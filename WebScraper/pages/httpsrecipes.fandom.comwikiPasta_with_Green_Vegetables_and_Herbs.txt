Description : 
 Mixing aromatic herbs like mint and basil with asparagus and peas creates a beautiful green dish. Salty feta sparks it up.
 ChupaNote: the only change I made to this recipe was to replace the black pepper with 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes. I ended up sprinkling more on the finished dish. I used whole wheat pasta.
