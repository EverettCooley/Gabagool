 The Mulato is a mild to medium dried  Poblano pepper , sold dried. Mexican Mulato chiles are part of the famous mole "trilogy" used in mole sauce as well as other Mexican sauces and stews. The Mulato's color while growing is dark green, maturing to red or brown. The dried Mulato is flat and wrinkled, and always brownish-black in color. The average length of the Mulato is ten centimeters, and it is typically five centimeters wide. Its shape is wide at the top, tapering to a blunt point.
 The Mulato has been described as tasting somewhat like chocolate or licorice, with undertones of cherry and tobacco. Its heat rating is 2,500 to 3,000 Scoville units.
 A spicier version of dried poblano pepper is the  Ancho chile  pepper.
