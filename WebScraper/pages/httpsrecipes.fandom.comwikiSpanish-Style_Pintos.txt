Ingredients
1-1/2 cups dry pinto beans 
1 cup chopped onion (1 large) 
1 cup sliced celery (2 stalks) 
3 cups water 
2 tablespoons olive oil or cooking oil 
1 cup chopped green sweet pepper (1 large) 
2 teaspoons chili powder 
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard 
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 14-1/2-ounce can tomatoes, cut up 
1 8-ounce can tomato sauce 
 
  Dairy sour cream (optional) 
 Sliced ripe olives (optional) 
 Shredded cheddar cheese (optional) 
 
 Directions
1. Rinse beans. In a large saucepan combine beans and enough water to
cover them. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer for 2 minutes.
Remove from heat. Cover and let stand 1 hour. (Or, omit boiling and
soak beans overnight.) 
 2. Drain and rinse the beans. In a 4- or 6-quart pressure cooker
combine the beans, onion, celery, water, and oil. 
 3. Lock lid in place. Place pressure regulator on vent pipe (if you
have a first-generation cooker). Over high heat, bring cooker up to
pressure. Reduce heat just enough to maintain pressure and pressure
regulator rocks gently; cook for 8 minutes. 
 4. Quick-release the pressure. Carefully remove lid. Drain beans.
Return the beans to the pressure cooker. 
 5. Stir in the sweet pepper, chili powder, dry mustard, crushed red
pepper, salt, undrained tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Bring to boiling.
Simmer, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until desired consistency. If
desired, serve with sour cream, sliced olives, and cheese. Makes 6
main-dish servings (6 cups).
