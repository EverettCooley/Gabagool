 About Shaoxing wine : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Shaoxing wine on Wikipedia 
 The Chinese rice wine (黃酒) is also known as Shaoxing Wine (紹興酒) or simply Shao Wine (紹酒). The brewery takes the natural process with the pure water of Jianhu-Mirror Lake. It has a unique flavour and a reputation throughout the nation and internationally. It is used both as a liquor and in cooking, and as a solvent for Chinese herbal medicated ointment.
 Good-quality medium-dry sherry may be substituted.
