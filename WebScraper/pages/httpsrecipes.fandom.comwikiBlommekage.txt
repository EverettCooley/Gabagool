 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup soft  butter 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 3  eggs 
 2¼ cups  flour 
 1½ teaspoons  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon  baking soda

 ¾ cup  almonds  — chopped 
 2 tablespoons  sugar 
 1½ tablespoons  cornstarch 
 1 pinch  salt 
 ½ cup  light corn syrup 
 1 teaspoon  butter

 Directions : 
 Cream butter, sugar and salt until light and creamy. 
 Beat the 3 eggs until fluffy and add. 
 Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and soda together and add alternately with the plum juice to the butter mixture. 
 Beat. 
 If the batter seems a little thin, add a little more flour. 
 Fold in the raisins and almonds. 
 Pour into a 10"-square pan greased and floured lightly. 
 Bake 1 hour in a preheated 350ºF oven. 
 After the cake has cooled cut it into squares. 
 Serve with the sauce made of the second set of ingredients: mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. 
 Gradually add plums and juice and blend well. 
 Add syrup and cook over low heat, stirring continuously until it thickens, about 3 minutes. 
 Remove from stove and beat in butter. 
 Add the almond extract.
