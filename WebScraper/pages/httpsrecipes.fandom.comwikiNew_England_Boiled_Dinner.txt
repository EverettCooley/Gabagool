 Serves 6 to 8 
 Ingredients : 
 4 – 5 lbs  corned beef  brisket 
 4 medium  onions , outer skins removed 
 6 medium  potatoes , peeled 
 8 small young  beets 
 6  carrots , scrubbed and scraped 
 6 small  turnips , scrubbed 
 1 medium head  green cabbage , quartered and cored 
 Directions : 
 Rinse the corned beef under cold running water to remove the brine. 
 Place in a large pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil, skimming off the scum that rises to the surface during the first 10 minutes. 
 Cover and simmer for 2 hours. 
 Then add the onions and potatoes, and continue to simmer. 
 Meanwhile, bring a quantity of water to boil in another saucepan and add the beets. 
 Boil them for 30-40 minutes, or until they are barely tender when pierced with a knife. 
 Drain and put them in a 250°F oven to keep warm. 
 When the onions and potatoes have cooked for 15 minutes, add the carrots and turnips to the pot and simmer for 30 minutes more. 
 Remove and slice the meat and arrange, surrounded by vegetables, on an ovenproof platter. 
 Place in the warm oven, along with the dish of beets. 
 Turn up the heat under the broth and, when it boils, add the cabbage. 
 Boil for 3 minutes, drain, and place in a separate serving bowl. 
 Serve the beef surrounded by carrots, turnips, onions, and potatoes, with the beets and cabbage in separate bowls.
