Description : 
 Beef in Tomato and Pepper Sauce. Here is a unique soup for all you adventurous chefs:) Please do not let your  plantains  turn yellow-black because they turn sweet. Must use green  plantains .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium  onion , finely chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 2  red  or green bell peppers , seeded and chopped 
 1 fresh  hot red or green pepper , seeded and chopped 
 3 pounds lean, boneless  beef chuck , cut into 1-inch cubes 
 1 x 10 ounce can Mexican  green tomatoes  and liquid from the can 
 4 medium  tomatoes , peeled and coarsely chopped 
 1  bay leaf 
 2  cloves 
 ½ teaspoon  oregano 
 salt , freshly ground  pepper 
 ½ cup  beef stock , more or less 
 2 stale  tortillas , or 2 tablespoons  masa harina , or 2 tablespoons  cornmeal 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  in a heavy saucepan or casserole and saute the  Onion ,  garlic , and  peppers  until the  Onion  is soft. 
 Add the meat and all the other ingredients except the tortillas. 
 The liquid should barely cover the meat. 
 Add a little more stock, if necessary. 
 Cover, and simmer gently until the  Beef  is tender, about 2 hours. 
 If using tortillas soak them in cold  water , squeeze tender, about 2 hours. 
 If using tortillas soak them in cold  water , squeeze them out, and crumble like breadcrumbs. 
 Add to the casserole and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce is thickened. 
 If using  masa harina  or  cornmeal , mix it with a little cold  water  and stir into the stew, cooking just until the sauce is thickened ( cornmeal  will take a few minutes longer to thicken). 
 Serve the stew on a bed of Arroz Guatemalteco ( rice , Guatemalan-style).
