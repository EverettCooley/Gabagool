 3/4 large head  romaine lettuce  (or one whole small one)

 1/4 tsp  Onion  powder

 braggs all purpose seasoning, or  sea salt  to taste 
 1/4 cup flaked  yeast 
 1/2 tsp  dulse  powder (optional) 
 1/4 tsp vegit or salt-free seasoning (optional) 
 2 tsp  fruit sugar 
 Directions : 
 Just throw all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix. This is our family's very favorite salad recipe. We can eat this daily without ever tiring of the salad. The  dulse  powder is an acquired taste which is why it is optional, but we personally really love it added to the salad. Also, you can freely add raw mixed vegetables of your choice. We prefer just plain  romaine lettuce . Recipe reprinted with permission from HealthRecipes.com
