Description : 
 This creamy sauce has a lemony taste that works wonderfully with most vegetable dishes - casserole and steamed - and is a favorite with stuffed cabbage. Use it to give a special touch to leftovers containing ground meat, rice, or vegetables where the lemon taste will blend.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 – 3  eggs , separated 
 1 tablespoon of  water 
 juice of 2 – 3  lemons 
 broth from the dish being cooked (or hot  beef  or  chicken broth  or  stock ) 
 Directions : 
 Beat the egg whites until foamy. 
 Beat in egg yolks, water, lemon juice, and 2-3 ladlesful of broth, beating (or whisking) continuously. 
 Add the avgolemono sauce to the dish being cooked, stir, cover with a towel for 10 minutes, and serve. 
 Alternate Preparation : 
 Use boiling meat or chicken stock if you want to prepare it for a dish that doesn't have its own liquid, like leftovers. 
 Remember to add the liquid very slowly, beating or whisking continuously, so it mixes smoothly.
