      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 A jambalaya is similar to a Spanish paella. This funny word itself is derived from the Spanish "jamón" - which means  Ham . Jambalaya is a "creole" dish - i.e. originating in the American south of Louisiana - near New Orleans - and is a fusion of French, Spanish, Italian and African influences. Probably dating from sometime in the 1700s.
 The Spanish influence arises from the fact that the Louisiana territory was traded to Spain in 1763. The Spanish contributions to Creole cuisine include mixing and meat in one dish, hence the  Shrimp  (prawn) and  Sausage  jambalaya!
 Here is the Route79 method of cooking this really tasty dish!
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 For the part you will need 250g packet of raw  prawns  (shrimps). Go for the extra large ones. I know these are expensive - but if you hunt around the freezer section in Tesco you will find something called "Extra large Oz  banana prawns " - these are £5 for the packet - and are bigger than tiger prawns - and best of all they are raw and they have had their tails left on! make sure you rapid-thaw the frozen shrimps when you get them home - by running cold  water  over them in the sink for around 15 mins.
 For the  meat  part - you need 120g of ]]chorizo]] sausage - which you can get from the deli-counter. Peel the outer skin off the  sausage  and cut it all up into bite-sized pieces.
 And then the rest of the ingredients are:
 
 1 medium  onion  - sliced into 5 cm long pieces 
 1 large  green pepper  - chopped to a similar size 
 2 sticks of  celery  - chopped similarly - but on the diagonal 
 some pulped chunks of  garlic  and  ginger  from your freezer 
 a  chicken stock  cube 
 2 or 3 medium  tomatoes  - finely chopped 
 som peri-peri sauce - or Creole sauce - or Tabasco - whatever you like to give the spicy kick 
 some chopped  flat-leaf parsley 
 and 1 mug of washed  rice  (preferably  basmati rice ) 
 Directions : 
 So - here goes:
 The first thing to do is to cook the prawns. Whatever you do - don't overdo them! Bring a small pan of  water  to the boil and throw the raw prawns in - simmer them for 3 minutes only - and then take them out - draine them and set them to one side - they will added to the finished dish right at the end. Leave the shell tails on - it makes the final dish look really nice.
 
 
       Cook prawns in boiling water for 3 mins     
         Set the cooked prawns aside     
 Then prepare the  chicken stock  - use exactly twice the amount of  water  than you have of the  rice  - boil it - and add the crushed cube until all of it has dissolved. rind in some  black pepper  - and also add to the stock your spicy sauce. Keep this stock to one side.
 Then get a decent sized frying pan or wok - something which has a lid - and light the flame underneath it on high. Throw in the chorizo  Sausage  pieces - no  oil  needed - and stir them about until they start to fry in their own  oil .
 
 
         Prepare the stock: Add 2 turns of pepper, add a generous blob of peri-peri sauce     
         Fry the chorizo sausage - no oil     
 After a few mins of frying the  Sausage  - pour them onto absorbent kitchen paper - and set to one side. Using the same pan - add some  vegetable oil  (I use sunflower) and fry the  onions  until they soften a little.
 
 
         Set aside the drain on absorbent kitchen paper     
         Fry the onions for a few minutes     
 Then add the  green peppers . Make sure the flame is on real high at this point. And stir-fry the  onions  and  peppers  until they start to develop browned edges.
 
 
         Then add the chopped peppers; Keep stir frying on high flame     
         Fry until onions and peppers get brown edges to them     
 Then turn the flame down a bit - and add the pulped  garlic  and  ginger  - at this point the aroma in your kitchen will be simply heavenly. After a few mins of stir-frying - add the  celery  pieces and continue to stir-fry. You should be really enjoying it by now!
 
         Then add the pulped garlic and ginger     
         Then add the chopped celery     
 Then add the pieces of  Sausage  - giving it all a really good stir - and then add the washed/drained  rice  - making sure that the  rice  gets thoroughly coated with whatever oils are in the pan.
 
 
         Then add the sausage pieces     
         Then add the washed rice; Give it all a good stir     
 
When the  rice  is well stirred - add the stock liquid - and turn up the flame until the pot reaches the boil. Throw in the chopped  tomato  and  bay leaves  at this point - making sure that the boiling is relatively fierce.
 
 
         Pour in the stock liquid; Ensure the rice is all covered     
         Throw in the chopped tomato; Add the bay leaves too     
 Then put the lid on the pot - and turn down the flame to the lowest possible you can get it. The  rice  will cook in the steam for about 20 mins.
 Whatever you do - DO NOT TAKE THE LID OFF THE PAN WHILST THE  rice  IS COOKING! I know that you might be tempted - just to see how it's doing - but please don't - every bit of steam is necessary for a perfect finish. If you take the lid off you will get imperfect  rice ! After 20 mins - take the lid off and throw in the cooked prawns. Stir them around in the  rice  mixture gently - only 2 or three turns of the spoon! Then put the lid back on - and let the  rice  rest for 5 mins.
 
         Put lid on and bring to boil; Then reduce flame to lowest possible and let rice cook for 20 mins     
         After 20 mins turn off flame add the prawns- and stir them in; Put lid back on for 5 another mins     
 After five mins - you are ready to serve! Sprinkle the  parsley  and spring  Onion  on top of the mixture in the pot - and stir gently. Serve up on a plate for you and your partner - and eat! (If you want it extra spicy - splash on some Tabasco over your plate.) I recommend a glass of chilled sparkling  white wine  to go with this - in fact Spanish Cava is perfect - and you can get hold of it really cheap from your local Safeway/Tesco/whatever.
 
         Sprinkle on the prasley and spring onion     
         Serve up and eat!     
 
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
