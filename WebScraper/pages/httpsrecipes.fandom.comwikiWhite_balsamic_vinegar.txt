About white balsamic vinegar : 
 A version of  balsamic vinegar  that is made with the white wine vinegar and grape must (fresh pressed juice with seeds and skins). Traditional balsamic vinegar is made with the red wine vinegar, thus providing a deep reddish color which may add an undesirable tint to the food being dressed. The white variety is often used while the color of white sauces or foods will be adversely affected by the dark brown color of traditional balsamic vinegar. The white balsamic vinegar is milder and less sweet than regular balsamic vinegar and is often considered more suitable for use with the salad dressings, since it does not have a strong flavor that will be overpowering when used on salad greens.
