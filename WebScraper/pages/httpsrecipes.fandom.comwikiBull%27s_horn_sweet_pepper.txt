 About Bull's horn : 
 A Bull's Horn Sweet Pepper is a narrow pepper slightly curved towards its end so that it tapers to a very fine point like a horn. The pepper can be 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) long, and 2 inches (5 cm) wide at its widest point, with thick walls. The peppers are usually pale green to yellow, but red varieties also exist. These peppers are sweet and very mild, and can be eaten fresh or cooked.
