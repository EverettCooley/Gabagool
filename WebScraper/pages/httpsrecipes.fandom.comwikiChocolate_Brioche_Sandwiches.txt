 Description : 
 This delectable breakfast sandwich is a twist on the classic French "pain au chocolat" and makes a special breakfast ultra special. Pistachios complement the chocolate spread, adding texture, a satisfying crunch and wonderful color contrast. If you cannot find brioche at your grocery store, you can use a challah loaf or a plain white loaf - just make sure you buy an unsliced loaf so you can control how thick you want to cut the slices.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 thick  brioche  bread slices 
 8 tbsp.  chocolate  spread 
 2 tbsp. shelled  pistachios , finely chopped 
 Directions : 
 Toast the brioche slices until golden on both sides. Spread four of the slices thickly with the chocolate spread and sprinkle over the chopped pistachios in an even layer. 
 Place the remaining brioche slices on top of the chocolate and nuts and press down gently. Using a sharp knife, cut the sandwiches in half diagonally and serve immediately. 
 Notes : 
 The chocolate spread should be a plain spread, NOT Nutella. However, if you can't find a plain chocolate spread at your grocery store, you can do one of two things. You may certainly use Nutella, but keep in mind how the pistachios will taste with the hazelnuts in the Nutella. You may also make your own version of a chocolate spread, but keep it thinner in consistency than a ganache.
