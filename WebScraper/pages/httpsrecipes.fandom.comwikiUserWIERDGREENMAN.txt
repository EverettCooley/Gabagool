 About me : 
 First off: My name is not spelled incorrectly. "Wierd" is a programming language.  
 My favorite things in the galaxy, besides Star Wars (starwars.wikia.com), Pop-Tarts (poptarts.wikia.com, where I'm an admin), and Lady Gaga (ladygaga.wikia.com) are SPELLING and GRAMMAR. I am one of two students in an advanced vocabulary class at school. I am a perfectionist when it comes to conventions, and love editing and correcting in general. Even when I know very little about a topic, such as Lie to Me* (lietome.wikia.com) and the state of Michigan (michigan.wikia.com), I will not hesitate to correct errors regarding conventions.  
 I love love love Wikia. The wiki that I am most active on is Wookieepedia, or starwars.wikia.com.  
 Did I mention that I love Star Wars?  
 
 My favorite foods : 
 Pop-Tarts
