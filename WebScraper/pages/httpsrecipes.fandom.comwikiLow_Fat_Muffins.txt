Ingredients : 
 Wet ingredients : 
 1 large mashed  banana  (or 2 small) 
 ¼ cup unsweetened  applesauce 
 ¼ cup  molasses 
 ¼ cup  raspberry preserves  /  jam   [1] 
 1 cup  soy  /  rice milk 
 ⅛ cup  brown sugar   [2] 
 1 cup  raisins 
 2 cup raw  bran 
 Dry ingredients : 
 1¼ cup  flour 
 3 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  soda 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 dash  cinnamon

 In a large bowl mix well the wet ingredients. 
 In a small bowl sift the dry ingredients add to wet ingredients.

 Notes : 
 
 ↑   With the  raspberry preserves , I find an ⅛ of a cup plenty. You could also substitute  raspberry  with any other flavor of jam / preserve I would think. I'm trying  peach  next time.  
 
 ↑   Original called for ¼ cup  brown sugar .
