Description : 
 a stir-fry is a delicious Asian recipe which I decided to remix. Stir-fry,  more like  stir fries . French fries and stir-fries are a match made in heaven. For this recipe I've decided to remove  some  ingredients for the ultimate French fry experience. Unless you want to just mix  Hungry Jack's  and frozen stir-fry this recipe shouldn't be any better since I'm just a household mum who can't get her stupid kids busy other than playing  Angry  Birds  and  Fruit Ninja  on their ' Ipads' .
 
 Ingredients : 
 French fries from a fast food restaurant (Unless if your good). 
 
 Directions : 
 Saut√©  pork  in  oil  in a large skillet. Pour off fat, if necessary. 
 Add broth,  marjoram ,  garlic , and  pepper  to the skillet. 
 Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 10 minutes, or until meat is tender. 
 Add  mushrooms ,  squash , and  cornstarch , blended with  water . Cook, stirring, until sauce is clear and thickened. 
 Add  tomatoes  and  onions . Cover and simmer until heated through. 
 Add  salt  to taste. Serve over fluffy  rice . Garnish with the chili leaves, if desired.
