 Ingredients : 
 2½ cups of Quaker  oats  (quick or old fashioned, uncooked) 
 1 cup  flour 
 2  eggs 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 cup  butter 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla 
 1 cup  brown sugar 
 ⅓ cup  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  baking soda 
 1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 1 cup  raisins 
 Directions : 
 Mix the salt, butter, vanilla, and brown sugar in a big bowl. 
 Add the sugar, baking soda, eggs and ground cinnamon until fully mixed. 
 Stir in the flour, mixing thoroughly. 
 Stir in the Quaker Oats until you see no flour. 
 Mix in the raisins. 
 Drop by large rounded spoonsful onto a ungreased cookie sheets (about six per batch). 
 Press the cookies down to make them flat before baking. 
 Bake in a preheated 350°F for 20 Minutes or until brown at the top. 
 Notes : 
 Ovens may vary, (I used a toaster oven) but these can be made as well in a regular oven. They will cook in less time in a regular oven so watch them (check them at the 10 minute mark).
