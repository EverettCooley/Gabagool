   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce                                 
   2 tablespoons cider vinegar                                     
   3/4 cup red chili peppers, roasted, chopped                     
   Water                                                           
   4 tablespoons flour                                             
   4 kaiser rolls                                                  
 
 Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat and add turkey. 
Cook for 4 minutes. Remove to pressure cooker. Add tomatoes, broth,
onions, chili, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar. 
Lock lid and bring to full pressure. Reduce heat, maintaining
pressure, and cook for 4 minutes. Naturally release pressure for 5
minutes, then quick-release remaining pressure. Stir in chopped
peppers. Whisk flour into enough cold water to form a smooth paste. 
Pour into turkey mixture, stirring, and cook until mixture is slightly
thickened and flavors are blended, 3-5 minutes.
