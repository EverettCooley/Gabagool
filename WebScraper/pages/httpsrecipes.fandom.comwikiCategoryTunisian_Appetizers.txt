 Tunisian appetizers usually come in all tastes and flavors. In any form, however, they are usually farily light to the palette, typically incorporating olives (and olive oil), fresh vegetables, breads, and sauces. Also, because meals are treated as a social event, there is always a good selection of appetizers from which to choose. And of course, no Tunisian food is complete without a generous helping of spicy hot Harissa!
