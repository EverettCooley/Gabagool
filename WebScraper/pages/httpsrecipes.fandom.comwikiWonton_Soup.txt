 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 Â½ lb  ground pork 
 2 oz peeled  shrimp , finely chopped 
 1 tsp  brown sugar 
 1 tbsp  chinese rice wine 
 1 tbsp  light soy sauce 
 1 tbsp chopped  green onion 
 1 tsp chopped fresh  ginger  root 
 24  wonton wrappers 
 3 cups  chicken stock 
 1  garlic  clove minced 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, mix the pork and shrimp with the sugar, wine or sherry, soy sauce, scallions, and ginger. 
 Blend well and leave to stand for 25-30 minutes. 
 Place about one teaspoon of the filling at the center of each wonton skin. 
 Moisten all 4 edges of wonton wrapper with water and pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding the wrapper over the filling to make a triangle. 
 Press edges firmly to make a seal. 
 Bring left and right corners together above the filling. 
 Overlap the tips of these corners, moisten with water and press together. 
 Place completed wrapper on the cornstarch platter and continue until all wrappers are used. 
 Soup : 
 Bring the chicken stock to a rolling boil. 
 Drop wontons in and cook for 5 minutes. 
 Garnish with chopped scallions and serve. (Note: uncooked wontons will keep in freezer for a good 2 months if well wrapped. Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from frozen and cooked 2 minutes longer). 
 To fry : 
 Heat 2 to 3 cups of oil in a wok until hot. 
 Deep-fry wontons in batches until golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. 
 Drain. 
 Serve with dipping sauce or duck sauce, also called plum sauce. 
 Notes : 
 Wontons also freeze well. Just place on cornstarch covered cookie sheet and freeze. Place in Ziploc when frozen. Take out what is needed when making the soup.
