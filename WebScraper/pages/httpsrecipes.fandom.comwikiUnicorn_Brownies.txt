 Ingredients : 
 2 cups sugar 
 1 cup vegetable oil 
 4 eggs 
 ⅔ cup cocoa powder 
 1 cup flour 
 ½ cup baking powder 
 2 sticks butter 
 2 cups powdered sugar 
 1 tsp vanilla 
 Optional: 1-3 tsp milk if icing is too dry 
 3 shades of pastel gel color Purple, blue, and teal 
 Various kinds of sprinkles 
 Instructions : 
 Beat together sugar and oil, then add in eggs, cocoa powder, flour, and baking soda and beat again until thoroughly mixed. 
 Line a square 9x9 inch baking tray with parchment, and spray with nonstick. Pour in brownie mix and bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. 
 Remove from oven and set aside to cool. 
 In a new bowl, beat together butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla to make your icing. 
 Divide into 3 portions and color each one with a different gel color. 
 Drop spoonfuls of each color on top of your cooled brownies in a random pattern, then spread out over the surface to make a wavy, swirled top layer. 
 Drop on various sprinkles, then let sit for at least 20 minutes so icing can stiffen up. 
 Cut into squares and serve.
