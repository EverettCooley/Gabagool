 Wikipedia Article  About Mitsuba on Wikipedia 
 Mitsuba (lit. "three leaves") is a herb commonly used in Japanese food. The botanical name is Cryptotaenia japonica. It is native to Japan, China, and Korea. It is very commonly used as a herb flavouring in miso soup, where it goes very well with daikon radish and akadashi-type miso. It is normally sold and used fresh, not dried.
 It may become slightly bitter if it is cooked too long.
