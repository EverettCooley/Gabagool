Aloco  is typical street-vendor food. Women heat up large vats of palm oil and fry sliced, ripe plantains for about 5 minutes. The resulting snack is a sweet/savory/chewy treat that one can eat by the freakin' handfull. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 red  palm oil 
 several ripe  plantain  bananas, peeled and cut into discs or cubes 
 salt 
 1  onion , chopped 
 2  tomatoes , peeled (if desired), and chopped 
 1  chile pepper , cleaned and chopped 
 Directions : 
 Heat a cup or two of  palm oil  in a skillet. 
 Sprinkle the raw  plantains  with  salt . 
 Fry the  plantains  until they are golden brown. 
 Remove the  plantains  from the  oil  and drain on absorbent paper (paper towel). 
 It may be best to fry the  plantains  in a few batches. 
 In the same skillet and  oil  in which the  plantains  were fried, fry the  onion ,  tomato , and  chile pepper  for a few minutes, stirring often. 
 Add a few spoonfuls of  water , reduce heat, and simmer for a several minutes until a thick, chunky sauce is obtained. 
 Some cooks add a splash of  vinegar . 
 Place the  plantains  on a plate, cover them with a grilled fish (see below), and pour the onion- tomato  mixture over them.
