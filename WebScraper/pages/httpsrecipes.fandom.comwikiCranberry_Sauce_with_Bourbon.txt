Description : 
 My mother makes the next recipe for a Christmas auction every year to help raise money for the non-profit organization she belongs too. People have paid as much as $12 a jar for this!
 
 by Joan P. Chilvers 
 Ingredients : 
 12 oz fresh  cranberries 
 4 cups  sugar 
 ½ cup  bourbon 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Stir ingredients together. 
 Place in the oven for 1 hour. Stir contents occasionally during cooking. 
 Notes : 
 Tastes best when it has had time to sit, for example, 2 weeks. The longer it sits, the stronger the flavours. 
 Store in a refrigerator indefinitely.
