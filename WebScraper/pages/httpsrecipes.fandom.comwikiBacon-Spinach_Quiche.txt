Description : 
       Bacon-Spinach Quiche     
 I like to have this sometimes on Sunday for brunch when I want something a little eggy/cheesy. Usually I serve it with a light crisp green salad with some sort of vinaigrette. Other times, usually in summer, I will cut up some fresh fruit, like  cantaloupe  and pieces of  watermelon  and  strawberries  and serve with. It makes a nice light meal. This particular recipe is from Barbara Jones.

 1 x 9 inch unbaked deep dish pie shell
