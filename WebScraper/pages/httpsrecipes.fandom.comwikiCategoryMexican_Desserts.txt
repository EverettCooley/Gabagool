 Sweet tacos or sweet tamales, fudges, polvorones, puddings, cookies and cakes are the main categories of the Mexican desserts. Milk (leche) is a basic ingredient, as it is used for tres leches (milk cakes), which are similar to sponge cakes and sweetened with syrups, frostings or toppings, the capirotoda with nuts and raisins, the delicate wedding cakes with butter or for the flans, which have a cheesecake texture and caramel. The chocolate is used for the spicy chocolate cake, the hot fudge sundaes or for the Mexican chocolate cake with cinnamon. Fruits are highly used in the Mexican cuisine and they are not missing from the desserts, either: apple enchiladas, bananas foster chimichangas with spiced rum, fruit filled nachos with apricots, strawberries, blueberries and mango ice. Pastry desserts are also very common and the most typical sweet pastries are churros -- pastry strips, deep fried and rolled or sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.
