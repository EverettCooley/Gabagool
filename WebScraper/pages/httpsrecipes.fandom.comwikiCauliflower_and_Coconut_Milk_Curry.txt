Description : 
 This is my favourite vegetarian curry. It's a simple one and quickly cooked. The taste is aromatic without being strongly spicy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large or 2 small  cauliflower  heads 
 2  tomatoes 
 1  onion 
 400 ml (4 dl)  coconut milk 
 1 – 2 tbsp cooking  oil 
 200 ml (2 dl) warm water 
 2 cloves of  garlic  (or to taste) 
 1 fresh  green chili 
 ½ tsp  turmeric 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 salt  - to taste (½ tsp) 
 3 tbsp  tamarind juice  (from 1 tsp of wet tamarind) or to taste 
 Directions : 
 Separate the cauliflower florets. 
 Cut the tomatoes (peeled or unpeeled) into 8 pieces. 
 Blend the onion, garlic, chili and turmeric into a paste in a blender or a food processor. 
 Heat the paste in a large, deep pan but don't let the paste burn. 
 Add the cauliflower floret and mix. 
 Add the coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. Let the curry simmer for 5 minutes. 
 Add the tamarind juice and the diced tomatoes. Simmer for another 2 minutes. 
 Serve with rice or as a side dish with another curry.
