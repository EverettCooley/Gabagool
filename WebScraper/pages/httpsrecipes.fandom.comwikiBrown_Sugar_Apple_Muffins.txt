 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F.

 Stir well. 
 Mix in the brown sugar, using the back of a wooden spoon to break up sugar clumps. 
 Mix the yogurt, apple juice, egg substitute or eggs, and oil in a small bowl. 
 Stir well. 
 Add the yogurt mixture to the oat bran mixture and stir well. 
 Fold in the apples and if desired, the nuts or dried fruit. 
 Coat only the bottoms of muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray and fill ¾ full with batter.
