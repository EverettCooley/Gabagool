Description : 
 This is a great holiday twist on those chocolate-swirled marbled cake batters we've loved for years. It's a super-quick recipe that starts with two mixes, stirs in a few clever ingredients, such as buttermilk, cocoa, and cider vinegar, and
yields a terrific cake with make-from-scratch red velvet flavor.
