 1 tablespoon of freshly ground  ginger  and  garlic 
 2 tablespoons of cooking  oil 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1 tablespoon of  cooking salt 
 2 tablespoons of  soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon of  sesame oil 
 2 tablespoons of hot  water 
 2 lbs minced  lamb  or  beef 
 6 cups of  self-raising flour 
 cold  water 
 Directions : 
 Add the cold  water  to the  flour  a little at a time. 
 Knead the dough for about 4-5 minutes. 
 Leave the dough to stand for a while at room temperature. 
 Add the hot  water , chopped  onion ,  oil ,  salt  and spices to the mince and mix them well. 
 Roll out the dough as thin as possible (on a well floured surface) and cut them into 4 inch rounds. 
 Put 2 teaspoons of the meat mixture on the round and flatten it down a little. 
 Put another round on top and pinch the edges together tightly. 
 Deep fry the sha-balé in moderately hot  oil  (only cook a few at a time).

 Sha-balé can also be shallow fried on a low gas (but remember to fry the mince and  onions  first). 
 Serve the sha-balé hot with  chilli sauce .
