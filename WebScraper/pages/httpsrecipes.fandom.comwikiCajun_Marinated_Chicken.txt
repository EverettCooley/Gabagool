 Description : 
 This is as great a recipe as it can get! Similar to the classic, red-hot barbecue chicken, this spicy Cajun poultry dish is made and mixed with real ketchup, herbs, spices, and vinegar and keeps a tangy aroma with the chicken.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For the poultry base : 
 1 – 2 pounds boneless  chicken breast 
 Marinade : 
 1 tbsp.  ketchup 
 ⅓ cup  oil 
 3 tbsp.  vinegar 
 1 tsp.  Italian seasoning 
 1 tsp.  garlic powder 
 ¼ tsp.  black pepper 
 1 ½ tbsp.  Cajun seasoning 
 dash of  salt 
 Directions : 
 Combine marinade ingredients and mix well. 
 Place chicken in a large self-closing plastic bag and add the marinade. 
 Marinate chicken for at least 10 – 20 minutes or for up to 3 hours for stronger flavor. 
 Grill chicken 10 – 14 minutes or until done.
