I discovered a new healthy  avocado  recipe with Mediterrenean taste. My secret is to use steamed  spinach  and  scallions  together with  lemon juice  and  kiwi .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 big or 2 small size genuine  California avocado (s) 
 1 to 2  kiwi fruit  (not very soft and sweet) 
 ½ pound fresh  spinach  (baby  spinach  preferred) 
 5 to 6  scallions 
 ½  bell pepper 
 1 to 2  plum tomato  or ½  tomato 
 salt , to taste 
 lemon juice  (1 whole  lemon ) 
 Directions : 
 Chop the  scallions ,  bell pepper  fine. 
 Cut the  kiwis  and tomatoes in fine cubes. 
 Mesh the  avocados . 
 Mix ingredients. 
 Steam the  spinach  in a pan with a very little  water , wait till  water  gets evaporated almost totally and spinach should get softened. 
 Add the  spinach  on top. 
 Again mix them by adding  salt  and  lemon juice .
