Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  vegetable oil 
 2 medium-size green  plantains , peeled, cut crosswise into ½-inch slices 
 2 cups salted  water 
 Directions : 
 In a large, heavy skillet, heat the  oil  over medium until a light haze forms above it. 
 Add as many  plantain  slices as you can without crowding the pan, and brown about 2 minutes on each side. 
 As they brown, transfer them to paper towels to drain. 
 On a cutting board, use a spatula to press each slice into a flat round about ¼-inch thick and 2 inches in diameter. 
 Dip the rounds in salted  water  and shake off the excess. 
 Heat the  oil  and fry the rounds again, about 1 minute on each side. 
 Drain on paper towels and serve at once.
