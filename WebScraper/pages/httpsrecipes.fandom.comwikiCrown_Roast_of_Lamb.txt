 Description : 
 Purchased from the Black Estate in Dallas, Texas in 1990. My mother has made this on several occasions and says it is delicious. Dated and source unknown.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 crown roast of  Lamb 
 3  garlic  cloves, peeled and slivered 
 Â¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 3 tablespoons  unsalted butter 
 1-tablespoon fresh  rosemary 
 2 teaspoons freshly ground  black pepper 
 12  new potatoes , peeled 
 1-tablespoon  salt 
 1 bunch  parsley 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 450. 
 Make small incisions in the meaty part of the  Lamb  every few inches and insert slivers of  garlic . 
 Paint the meat well with  olive oil  or rub with softened  butter . 
 Sprinkle all over with  rosemary  and  pepper . 
 Crumple a ball of aluminum foil and stuff in the center. 
 Place on a small rack and surround with the  potatoes  in a low roasting pan just large enough to hold it. 
 Place in the oven and immediately turn the heat down to 400. 
 Roast until done, about 30 minutes. 
 Remove the foil ball and immediately  salt  the meat. 
 Remove to a warmed platter, and let rest 5-to-10 minutes before serving.
