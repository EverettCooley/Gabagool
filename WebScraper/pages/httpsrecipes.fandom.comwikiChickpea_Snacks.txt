 Chickpea  Snacks
 
 Ingredients : 
 2	tsp	 salt 
 2	tsp	 Onion  powder 
 2	tsp	 garlic powder 
 1	tsp	Dry  mustard 
 1	tsp	 turmeric 
 3/4	tsp	 white pepper 
 1/2	tsp	 black pepper 
 1/2	tsp	 Cayenne 
 1	pkt	Artificial sweetner (1-gram) 
 1/2 lb	Dried  Chickpeas 
 5	cup	 water 
 1	cup	 apple juice 
 1	cup	 vegetable stock 
 Directions : 
 Combine 1 TABLESPOON ONLY of the seasoning mix with the artificial sweetener and set aside. 
 Place the  Chickpeas  and  water  in a container, add the rest of the UNsweetened seasoning mix, and soak overnight in the refrigerator. The  Peas  will be more than double in volume, so make sure the pot is big enough to hold them. 
 The next day: Place  Chickpeas  and the (seasoned)soaking  water  in a 5 quart pot over high heat. Add  apple juice  and cook 20 minutes. Add  vegetable stock  and cook until  Peas  are just tender, 40 minutes.Remove from heat, drain  Peas  in colander, rinse well, and drain. 
 Sprinkle  Peas  evenly with reserved sweetened seasoning mix. 
 Now you can cook them one of two ways. 1. Use a food dehydrator. Spread evenly around the trays and dehydrate until  Peas  are dry and crunchy, about 20-22hours. 2. Use an oven. Spread  Peas  on cookie sheets or sheet pans and cook at 150 degrees until dry and crunchy, about 20–22 hours.
