 Description : 
 A smooth and creamy fudge with just the right balance of  bitter  and sweet. I found the original recipe back in 2000 and refined it until I was satisfied with the taste and texture. Unlike a lot of fudges that have a gritty texture, most of this recipe's  Sugar  comes in the form of  marshmallow creme  (you may know it as " marshmallow  fluff"), which gives it the creaminess that people seem to love so much.

 Ingredients : 
 1 (7 ounce) jar  marshmallow creme 
 1½ cups white  sugar 
 ⅔ cup  evaporated milk 
 ¼ cup  butter 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 2 cups milk  chocolate chips 
 1 cup semi-sweet  chocolate chips 
 ½ cup chopped  walnuts  ( pecans  work just as well, if not better!) 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Line an 8x8 inch pan with  aluminum foil . Set aside. 
 In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine  marshmallow   cream ,  sugar ,  evaporated milk ,  butter  and  salt . 
 Bring to a full boil, and cook for 5 minutes,  stirring constantly . 
 Remove from heat and pour in  semi-sweet chocolate  chips and milk  chocolate chips . 
 Stir until  chocolate  is melted and mixture is smooth. 
 Stir in  nuts  and  vanilla . Pour into prepared pan. 
 Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until firm. 
 Note : 
 You may be tempted to leave the heat on while stirring the chips. While this would normally be ok, you really shouldn't do that in this recipe. If the mixture stays at a boiling temperature, you may be in for a nasty surprise when you add the [vanilla]]. Bottom line: it's safer for you and better for the fudge if the mixture cools down just a tad before the  vanilla  goes in. As long as you keep stirring, the chips will melt just fine. :)
