 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 3/4 cups  flour 
 1 cup confectioners'  Sugar 
 1/2 cup lukewarm  milk 
 3 teaspoons  yeast 
 8 Tbsp. softened  sweet butter 
 1 Tbsp.  lard  (or  butter ) 
 1 large  egg 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 1 Tbsp.  rum 
 pinch of ground  cinnamon 
 grated peel of 1/2  lemon 
 1 cup  slivered almonds 
 1/4 cup  candied lemon peel 
 1/4 cup  candied orange peel 
 1 1/4 cup  Raisins 
 
For basting:
 
 6 Tbsp.  milk  (room temperature) 
 8 Tbsp.  butter 
 3/4 cup powered  Sugar 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Sift the  flour  into a bowl and make a crater in the center. Into the crater, add 1/4 c. of the confectioners'  Sugar  and 1/4 cup of the  milk . Sprinkle the  yeast  over the  milk  and dust the  yeast  with a little  flour . Let the  yeast  develop for 15â€“20 minutes.
 
Add the  butter ,  lard ,  egg ,  salt , remaining  Sugar ,  vanilla extract ,  rum ,  cinnamon , grated  lemon peel ,  slivered almonds , candied  lemon  and  orange  peels, and  Raisins . Add only enough of the remaining  milk  to make dough pliable. Knead thoroughly and cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rise overnight. 
 
Knead again for 1 minute then shape the dough into a loaf and put it on a large buttered baking sheet. Use your fingertips to push back into the dough any  Raisins  that may have popped up to prevent scorching. Baste the loaf with tablespoons of  milk  and bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for approximately 50 minutes. Stollen must turn golden brown. Test to make sure it is done with a toothpick. 
 
Baste the stollen generously wih  butter  while it is still hot, then sprinkle with powered  Sugar . Repeat this process in order to attain a nice white surface and to help keep the stollen fresh and moist for several weeks. It's best to store for at least a week before serving.
