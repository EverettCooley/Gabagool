Description : 
       Cajun Spiced Chicken and Potatoes     
 I like this with a green salad for a quick weeknight meal. It's also lower in fat and calories. 15 minutes marinating time is included in the prep time.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup low-fat  buttermilk 
 1 tablespoon firmly packed  light brown sugar 
 2 teaspoons dried  thyme 
 2 teaspoons  paprika 
 1¼ teaspoons dried  oregano 
 1 teaspoon fresh ground  black pepper 
 ½ teaspoon  dry mustard 
 ¾ teaspoon  salt 
 1¼ lbs baking  potatoes , thickly sliced 
 4 boneless skinless  chicken breast  halves (about 1 lb total) 
 Directions : 
 In a medium bowl, combine the first seven ingredients ( buttermilk  through  mustard ) and ½ tsp of the  salt . 
 Place  potatoes  in another medium bowl. 
 Add 3 tbsp of the  buttermilk  marinade to the  potatoes ; toss to coat and set aside. 
 Marinate  chicken  in remaining marinade for 15 minutes. 
 Preheat oven to 400°F. 
 Place  chicken  then  potatoes  in a 9- x 13-inch baking dish. 
 Sprinkle with remaining ¼ tsp  salt . 
 Bake for 35 minutes.
