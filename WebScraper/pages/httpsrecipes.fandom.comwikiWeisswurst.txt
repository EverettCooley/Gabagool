 Description : 
       Weisswurst     
 Ingredients : 
 5 lbs.  Veal 
 1 oz. ground  mustard seed 
 5 lbs. lean  Pork  butts 
 1 Tbsp. ground  white pepper 
 3 1/2 ozs. non-fat dry  milk 
 1 tsp. ground  celery seeds 
 3 1/2 ozs.  salt 
 1 tsp.  mace 
 3 1/2 ozs. soy protein concentrate 
 1 oz. powdered dextrose 
 1 tsp. American Spice  Onion  powder 1 qt.  ice   water 
 1 tsp. dry  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Grind meat through a 1/4" or 3/8" grinder plate. Add all the ingredients except
the  water  and mix thoroughly until evenly distributed. Place the meat in the food processor, adding the  water  as you go along. This will help emulsify the meat. 
 
Stuff into a 32-35mm hog casing and make into 5" to 6" links. Place into 160 °F  water  and cook until an internal temperature of 150 °F is attained. Then shower the  Sausage  with cool  water  until the internal temperature falls to 75 °F. Place in cooler overnight before using. 
 
Grill or fry these brats until browned. For a delicate, crunchy coating, cover the sausages with  milk  for 10 minutes, then coat the sausages with  flour . Brown the  Sausage  in a skillet to which you have added  vegetable oil . 
 
Serve with German bread or a crusty roll and spicy  mustard  or horseradish sauce.
