 Most meat dishes in Ethiopian cuisine typically come in the form of a wat, or a thick, spicy stew. These wats are all made in generally the same manner, however, the amount of spices and types of meats and vegetables used in the preparation of such allow for very diverse meals. Another popular meat dish is referred to as kitfo which is raw beef served spicy hot. Meats that are used in the creation of wats and various other meat dishes are beef, lamb, and poultry. Pork is never chosen as an ingredient in meat dishes due to the fact that many Ethiopians are Muslim and therefore refrain from pork consumption because of religious reasons. Also, many other Ethiopians are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians and tend to eat less meat dishes and more vegetarian dishes. Because of this, meat dishes from this culture is generally more limited than that of other cultures.
