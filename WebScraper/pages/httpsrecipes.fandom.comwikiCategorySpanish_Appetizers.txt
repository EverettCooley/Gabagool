 When going to a fancy restaurant, as an appetizer, you can have the baked Bruschetta with roma tomato(influenced by the Italian cuisine) and red onion, or the calamari, tossed with fresh herb and garlic. Also, as an appetizer, you can taste the torta Del casar, which is the famous Spanish cheese, or some aged asiago cheese. Wines can be served as appetizers as well, especially since the viniculture is an important matter in the peninsula.
 Bread (pita) is a common thing in the Spanish cuisine, being served with a lot of dishes, or as an appetizer, together with vegetable sticks dipped in an artichoke sauce. Herb bread can also be served with olive oil and salt, just before dinner.
