 Wikipedia Article  About Fettuccine on Wikipedia 
 Fettuccine (literally "little ribbons" in Italian) is a type of pasta. It is a very flat, thick, noodle made of egg and flour. Although it can be purchased dried, the finest fettuccine noodles are produced fresh, from scratch, by pressing dough through a pasta maker. Fettuccine is often served with Alfredo sauce.
