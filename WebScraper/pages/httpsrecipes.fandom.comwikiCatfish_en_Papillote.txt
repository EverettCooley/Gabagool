 Description : 
 A  Catfish  recipe.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons dry  sherry 
 2 tablespoons chopped  green onions 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 1/4 teaspoon  ground ginger 
 4 U.S. Farm-Raised  Catfish  fillets, cut into 2-inch cubes 
 1 red  bell pepper , cut into julienne strips 
 2 ounces thinly sliced  Ham , cut into julienne strips 
 8  lemon  slices 
 
 Directions : 
 1. Preheat the oven to 400 °F. Cut parchment paper or aluminum foil into four 12-inch squares. Fold in half to make a crease down the center and then open up. 
 2. Mix soy sauce,  sherry ,  green onions ,  garlic  and  ginger  in a shallow dish. Add  Catfish  fillet cubes to the dish and toss to coat with marinade mixture. Set aside. 
 3. Divide the  Catfish  mixture among the squares of parchment or foil, placing it on one half of each square. Arrange strips of  bell pepper  and  Ham  over the  Catfish  and top with 2  lemon  slices. Spoon some of the remaining marinade mixture over each packet. Fold parchment or foil in half to cover the  Catfish , then tightly fold in the edges, crimping around each of the sides to seal the packets completely. 
 4. Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until flakes easily when tested with a fork; carefully unfold one side of one of the packets to check for doneness. To serve, tear or cut open packets carefully at the table, taking care not to get burned by the steam.
