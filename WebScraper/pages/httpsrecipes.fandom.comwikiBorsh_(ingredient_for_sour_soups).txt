Ingredients : 
 1 lb / 500 g  wheat bran 
 ⅔ lb / 300 g  cornmeal 
 1 oz / 30 g  yeast 
 1  lemon 
 3 sprouts of  oregano 
 2 – 3 slices  bread 
 Directions : 
 For this you need a 5 – 6 quart non-metal container. Put  bran  and  corn  meal in. Add  yeast  (or solid leftovers from previous batch of borsh). 
 On top of this, add boiling or very hot  water  to the top. After it cools off, add one sliced  lemon  (with peel),  oregano  as well as the bread. Then, mix this concoction every morning and evening with a long-handled wooden utensil. Taste it after a few days, and if it is sour enough, place container in a cool place so that the liquid clears. The solid stuff will sink to the bottom. Then put the clear liquid in bottles and keep them in a cool place. 
 The solids are to be kept in the same container and after you finish the borsh in the bottles, you can start again. You only add boiling  water  on top of it. Note: Don't leave the clear borsh to sit on the solids or it will turn  bitter .
