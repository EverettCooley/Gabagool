I am the webmaster and admin for cookbookwiki.com. I need volunteer contributors and some admins for the site!
 
 For those interested in Admin Duties : 
 If anyone is interested in becoming an administrator please let me know! Post here! Or if you just have a comment, feel free to post it here as well! 
 A few admin duties:
 
 Encourage community participation in discussions 
 Participate in discussions as often as possible 
 Make weekly enhancements to content (typos, misrepresentations and false information) 
 Occasionally add content to the site 
 Most important, greet new members and educate them on wiki guidelines 
 I will give you admin rights once you have shown administrative interest in the site by attending to these duties. 
 
 About me : 
 I have been a webmaster for 8 years. This is my first wiki site. Since this one I have started another 9 sites. For more information on these sites and my projects visit:  Wiki Publishing

 I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes.
