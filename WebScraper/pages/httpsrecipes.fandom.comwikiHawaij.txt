Hawaij (Arabic: خاواييج‎, Hebrew: חו׳יג׳‎), also spelled Hawayej or Hawayij is the name given to a variety of Yemenite ground spice mixtures used primarily for soups and coffee. Hawaij is used extensively by Yemenite Jews in Israel and its use has spread more widely into Israeli cuisine as a result.
 The basic mixture for soup is also used in stews, curry-style dishes, rice and vegetables dishes and even as a barbecue rub. It is made from cumin, black pepper, turmeric and cardamom. More elaborate versions may include ground cloves, caraway, nutmeg, saffron, coriander and ground dried onions. The Adeni version is made of cumin, black pepper, cardamom and coriander.
 The mixture for coffee is made from aniseed, fennel seeds, ginger and cardamom. Although it is primarily used in brewing coffee, it is also used in desserts, cakes and slow-cooked meat dishes. In Aden, the mixture is made with ginger, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon for black coffee, and when used for tea excludes the ginger.
