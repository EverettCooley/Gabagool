 Description : 
 Clam and peanut stew. Matata is a typical Mozambique entree made with  pumpkin leaves . We have used  spinach  as a substitute. This is one dish that wasn't influenced by the cooking of Portugal. Imagine a combination like clams and  peanuts  and tender young greens! You may want to hold out the  crushed red pepper . Start without it and add it gradually, with discretion.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  onions , chopped finely 
 2 oz  olive oil 
 4 cups canned chopped  clams 
 1 cup  peanuts , chopped finely 
 2  tomatoes  cut in small pieces 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  black pepper 
 1 tsp  crushed red pepper . 
 1½ lbs fresh  spinach  (young leaves) chopped finely. 
 2 cups  white rice 
 5 cups boiling salted  water 
 Directions : 
 In a 4-quart saucepan sauté the  onions  in  olive oil  until soft but not brown. 
 Add clams,  peanuts ,  tomatoes ,  salt ,  black pepper  and  crushed red pepper . 
 Simmer gently for 30 minutes. 
 Add  spinach . 
 Cover tightly and, as soon as leaves have wilted, matata is ready to serve. 
 Correct the seasoning. 
 Rice : 
 Cook  white rice  in boiling salted  water  until tender. 
 Serve matata over  rice .
