 Add  chard  stems and ribs,  salt , and  pepper  and cook, stirring occasionally, until stems are just tender, about 6 minutes. 
 Stir in  chard  leaves and  water  and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. 
 Lamb chops : 
 Broil chops while  chard  cooks: preheat broiler. 
 Sprinkle chops with  garlic ,  salt ,  rosemary , and  pepper , then broil on a lightly oiled broiler pan, 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning over once, for medium-rare, 6 to 7 minutes total.
