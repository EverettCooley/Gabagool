Description : 
 High in fiber and protein, low in fat, easy and really yummy! I've always think meatloaf looks and smells so delicious and savory so, as a vegetarian, I decided to make a no-meat version! This is basically our favorite meatloaf recipe but with cooked mashed  lentils  instead of ground meat. The result is a very tasty dinner!
 
 
 Ingredient : 
 2 cups  water 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 cup  lentils 
 1 small  onion , diced 
 1 cup  quick-cooking oats 
 ¾ cup grated  cheese  ( cheddar ,  Swiss ,  jack  or  American ) 
 1  egg , beaten 
 4½ ounces  spaghetti sauce   or   tomato sauce 
 1 teaspoon  garlic powder 
 1 teaspoon dried  basil 
 1 tablespoon dried  parsley 
 ½ teaspoon seasoning  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Add  salt  to  water  and boil in a saucepan. 
 Add  lentils  and simmer covered 25 – 30 minutes, until  lentils  are soft and most of  water  is evaporated. 
 Remove from fire. 
 Drain and partially mash  lentils . 
 Scrape into mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly. 
 Stir in  onion ,  oats  and  cheese  until mixed. 
 Add  egg ,  tomato  sauce,  garlic ,  basil ,  parsley , seasoning  salt  and  pepper . 
 Mix well. 
 Spoon into loaf pan that has been generously sprayed with pam (non-stick  cooking spray ) or well-greased. 
 Smooth top with back of spoon. 
 Bake at 350 °F for 30 – 45 minutes until top of loaf is dry, firm and golden brown. 
 Cool in pan on rack for about 10 minutes. 
 Run a sharp knife around edges of pan then turn out loaf onto serving platter.
