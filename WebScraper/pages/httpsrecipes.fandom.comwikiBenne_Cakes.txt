Description : 
 Benne cakes are a popular snack cookie that originated in Africa, where the benne seed (or sesame seed as it is known in America) comes from. It is enjoyed year round in Africa, and is especially popular in America during the Kwanzaa celebration. Benne seeds are said to be eaten for good luck, so eating these cakes during Kwanzaa, which begins a new year, is a great tradition.
