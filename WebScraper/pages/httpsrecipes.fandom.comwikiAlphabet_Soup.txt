This soup makes one of my 4-year-old's favorite meals. We like to use tri-color alphabet pasta. Any small pasta would work however.
 The recipe is based on the pasta e fagioli recipe found in the "Saved by Soup" cookbook by Judith Barrett.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  onion , diced 
 2 – 3  carrots , diced 
 2 stalks  celery , diced 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 box  chicken broth  (about 4 cups) 
 1 can diced  tomatoes  with juice (about 2-3 fresh tomatoes) 
 1 can  navy  or  cannellini beans , drained and rinsed 
 ⅔ cup  alphabet pasta 
 1 – 2 tbsp fresh  oregano ,  basil , and  parsley  (optional, and to taste) 
 Directions : 
 Heat olive oil in a large soup pot 
 Add onions, carrots and celery. 
 Sauté for a few minutes until they are softened. 
 Add chicken broth and diced tomatoes. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes
