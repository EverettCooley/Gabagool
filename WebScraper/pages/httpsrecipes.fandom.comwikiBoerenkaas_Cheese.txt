A farmhouse cheese originating in Holland that is made from unpasteurized cow's milk. Semi-hard in texture, this cheese is a gouda cheese that is typically made by small manufacturers producing raw milk cheeses. The amber outer rind covers a creamy tan-colored cheese with a smooth texture containing only a few holes from air. Aged for several months, this cheese provides a rich nutty flavor that becomes stronger and somewhat fruity as it matures. Boerenkaas is a good cheese to use for baking or grilling and is often served on hot or cold sandwiches, for snacking or for breakfast. This cheese may also be referred to as Boorenkaas Gouda.
