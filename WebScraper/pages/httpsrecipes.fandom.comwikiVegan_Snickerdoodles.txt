 Named after you know who. Ho Ho Ho. Enjoy!
 
 Makes about 30 cookies. This recipe can be halved, if desired. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  margarine 
 1½ cups granulated  white sugar 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 4 tbsp  soy milk  whipped with 2 tbsp  cornstarch 
 3 cups  unbleached white flour 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  tapioca starch  or  cornstarch 
 2 tbsp  cinnamon 
 4 tbsp granulated  white sugar 
 1 tbsp  cocoa powder  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). 
 In a large bowl, cream the  margarine  and  sugar  together until smooth. 
 Add the  vanilla , and the  cornstarch / soymilk  mixture, and beat until well-mixed. 
 In a smaller bowl combine the  flour ,  baking soda ,  salt , and tapioca/ corn starch . 
 Stir this into the wet ingredients and combine well. 
 In a very small bowl stir together the  granulated sugar ,  cinnamon  and  cocoa powder  (if desired). 
 Begin rolling the cookie dough into balls of about 3 tbsp each. 
 Roll each ball in the  cinnamon / sugar / cocoa powder  mixture until completely coated and place on an ungreased baking sheet. 
 Continue until all the dough is used up. 
 Using the bottom of a glass, press down on each ball until they are about an inch thick. 
 Bake for 12 – 14 minutes, and no more. 
 The cookies should still seem very soft when you remove them from the oven. 
 Let cool on the pans for about 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire baking rack and let cool completely.
