 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 box lasagna noodles 
 1 can (1 lb) fatfree vegetarian 
 refried beans 
 1 cup chunky salsa (any degree of 
 eat you prefer) 
 1 cup fatfree or 1% fat cottage 
 Cheese 
 1 cup shredded fatfree (or low fat 
 if desired)  Cheddar   Cheese 
 Directions : 
 Cook noodles according to package directions. Rinse and drain. In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame until runny (helps to spread the mixture). Place a small amount of the bean mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish. Layer four or five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra length of noodle and save for the next noodle layer). Spread ½ of the bean/salsa mix on top of noodles then top with ½ the  cottage cheese  and some of the  Cheddar . Top with more noodles then the remaining bean/salsa mix and  cottage cheese . Top with more  Cheddar  and remaining noodles. Top with a little more  Cheddar . Bake in microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly). This was really good and alot easier than it sounds. Giving a recipe for how you layer lasagna is really a pain!
