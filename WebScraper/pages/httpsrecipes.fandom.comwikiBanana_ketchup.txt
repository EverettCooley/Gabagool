 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup golden raisins 
 1/3 cup chopped sweet onions 
 2 large garlic cloves, quartered 
 1/3 cup tomato paste 
 4 large very ripe bananas, peeled and sliced 
 1-1/3 cup cider vinegar, divided use 
 3 to 4 cups water 
 1/2 cup (packed) dark brown sugar 
 1-1/2 tsp salt 
 1/2 tsp ground chipotle chile pepper or to taste 
 1/4 cup light corn syrup 
 2 tsp ground allspice 
 1 tsp ground cinnamon 
 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg 
 1/4 tsp ground cloves 
 2 tbsp dark rum 
 Directions : 
 Place the  raisins ,  onions ,  garlic ,  tomato paste ,  bananas , and 2/3 cup  vinegar  in the bowl of a  food processor  fitted with the metal blade. Process until smooth and pour into a large, heavy saucepan.
 To the  banana  mixture in the saucepan, add remaining 2/3 cup  vinegar , 3 cups water, brown sugar,  salt , and ground chipotle chile pepper. Stir to combine.
 Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered, stirring the  ketchup  occasionally, for 1 hour and 15 minutes. If the  ketchup gets too thick and begins to stick, add some of the remaining water (up to 1 cup).
 Add corn syrup,  allspice ,  cinnamon ,  nutmeg , and cloves. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, for another 15 minutes or until it is thick enough to coat a metal spoon. Stir in the  rum  and remove from heat. Let cool for 10 minutes.
 Push  ketchup  through a fine strainer, mashing the solids with the back of a spoon. Let cool to room temperature, pour into glass bottles, cover, and refrigerate. Use within 1 month. Banana ketchup is especially good as a  condiment  with  pork  and  poultry .
