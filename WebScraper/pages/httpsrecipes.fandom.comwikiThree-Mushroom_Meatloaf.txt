 Serves : 6 
 Ingredients 
 1½ pounds  ground beef 
 2 teaspoons  butter 
 ½ cup finely chopped  onion 
 8 ounces assorted wild or  button mushrooms , sliced 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 ¾ cup soft  breadcrumbs 
 1  egg 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ¾ teaspoon dried  thyme  leaves, crushed 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper 
 Pepper Gravy 
 1 teaspoon butter 
 ½ cup diced,  red ,  yellow  or green  bell pepper 
 1 jar (12 ounces) beef  gravy 
 ½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed 
 Directions 
 Heat oven to 350 °F. 
 Heat 2 teaspoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion, cook and stir 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook 6 to 8 minutes or until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes. 
 Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, salt, ¾ teaspoon thyme, pepper and mushroom mixture in large bowl, mixing lightly but thoroughly. 
 Shape beef mixture into 8 x 4-inch loaf on rack in broiler pan. 
 Bake in 350 °F oven 1¼ hours to medium (160 °F) doneness, until not pink in center and juices show no pink color. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting. 
 Meanwhile heat 1 teaspoon butter in medium saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add bell pepper; cook and stir 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in gravy and ½ teaspoon thyme; heat through. Cut meatloaf into 1-inch thick slices; serve with gravy. 
 Notes 
 Due to the natural nitrate content of certain ingredients often used in meatloaf, such as onions, celery and bell peppers, meatloaf may remain pink even when a 160 °F internal temperature has been reached. Always check the internal temperature using a meat thermometer or instant-read thermometer to be certain it reaches 160 °F. 
 Tips 
 A combination of mushrooms such as shiitake, cremini (brown) and button may be used. 
 To make soft bread crumbs, place torn bread in food processor or blender container. Cover; process, pulsing on and off, to form fine crumbs. One and one-half slices make about 1 cup crumbs
