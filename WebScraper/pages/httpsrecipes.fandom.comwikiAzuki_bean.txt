 The  adzuki bean  ( Vigna angularis)  is an annual vine widely grown throughout East Asia and the Himalayas for its small (approximately 5 mm) bean. The cultivarsmost familiar in Northeast Asia have a uniform red colour, however, white, black, gray, and variously mottled varieties also are known.
 In East Asian cuisine, the adzuki bean is commonly sweetened before eating. In particular, it often is boiled with sugar, resulting in red bean paste. It also is common to add flavoring to the bean paste, such as  chestnut .
