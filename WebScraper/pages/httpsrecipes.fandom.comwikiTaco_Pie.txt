Ingredients : 
 1 lb  ground beef 
 1 medium  onion , chopped 
 1 pkg.  taco seasoning  mix 
 ¾ cup  water 
 1 (16 oz) can  refried beans  (I use fat-free) 
 1 (8 oz) jar taco sauce, divided 
 1 baked 9-inch  pastry shell  (I use all-ready pie crust, although you may use frozen crust or make your own) 
 1 cup (8 oz.) shredded  cheddar  cheese, divided 
 1 cup crushed  corn chips  (I use Fritos™) 
 Directions : 
 Cook ground  beef  and  onion  in a skillet until meat is browned, stirring to crumble meat. 
 Drain. (I add  onion  after  beef  is cooked and drained to limit amount of fat absorbed by  onion ) 
 Add  taco seasoning  mix and  water , stirring well. 
 Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Combine  refried beans  and ⅓ cup taco sauce. 
 Spoon half of bean mixture in bottom of  pastry shell . 
 Top with half of meat mixture, half of  cheese  and all of  corn  chips. 
 Repeat layers with remaining bean mixture, meat mixture, and  cheese . 
 Bake at 400 °F for 20–30 minutes. 
 Serve with shredded  lettuce , chopped  tomato ,  sour cream  (if desired) and remaining taco sauce.
