 About Granulated sugar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Granulated sugar on Wikipedia 
 Granulated sugar is the term for the standard, widely used form of pure white sugar. Do not use superfine granulated sugar unless specified. Store sugar indefinitely in an airtight container. 
 In general use, English-speakers understand sugar as referring to sucrose (also called "table sugar" or saccharose), a disaccharide in white crystalline solid form. It has become the most commonly-used sweetener for altering the flavor and properties (such as mouthfeel, preservation, and texture) of food and drinks. Sugar-producers commonly extract commercially-available table sugar either from sugar cane or from sugar beet.
