Description : 
 One person said she still had enough cookie dough left over for about a dozen cookies, but use your own judgement on whether to use all the dough at once. She bought clean pizza boxes and presented the pizzas to the recipients and said they were really a hit. This uses the recipe on the Nestle® Toll House chocolate chips bag.
