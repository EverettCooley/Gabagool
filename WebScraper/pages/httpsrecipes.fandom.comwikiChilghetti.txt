 In Popular Culture : 
 On the 2002 WB television show  "Do Over"   [2] , the un-aired 15th and final episode entitled "Chilghetti", featured the main character Joel ( Penn Badgley ) attempting to convince his mother Karen ( Gigi Rice ) that marketing chilghetti was a poor idea. Joel goes so far as to sabotage the batch of chilghetti that his mother is bringing to the bank to convince a loan officer of the potential of the dish. His protests were based on his knowledge of the future and he refused to change his mind until he realized he hadn't actually tasted the dish. Upon sampling it, he realized the error of his ways and rushed to correct his sabotage.
