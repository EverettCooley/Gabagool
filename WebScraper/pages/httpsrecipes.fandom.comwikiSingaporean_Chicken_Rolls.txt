 Ingredients : 
 Stuffing : 
 250 gm boneless  chicken  (could substitute with seared ) 
 250 gm  potatoes 
 250 gm  onions 
 2 tbsp  red pepper  (red  capsicum ) 
 2 tbsp  curry  powder (fine mixture of  chilli powder , coriander powder,  turmeric  powder and a pinch of  garam masala  powder) 
 Â¼ cup  oil 
 salt  to taste 
 Rolls : 
 250 gm  flour 
 2 cups  milk 
 1  egg 
 salt  to taste 
 For frying : 
 3 cups  oil 
 2  eggs 
 1 can  breadcrumbs 
 Directions : 
 Stuffing : 
 Boil the  potatoes  and peel off the skin. 
 Cut  chicken  into small pieces. 
 Dice  onions . 
 Add the  oil  to a pan at medium heat. Add the  onions ,  chicken , and  potatoes  in that order leaving about half a minute between each and cook for 4 minutes. 
 Add the  curry  powder, red pepper and  salt  and cook for 10 minutes. 
 Remove from stove and place where it is easily accessible. 
 Rolls : 
 Mix the  flour ,  milk  and  eggs  using a mixer. 
 Heat a non-stick pan which has been wiped with a paper towel soaked in  butter  or  oil . 
 Pour in the batter to barely cover the bottom of the pan. Heat at low heat for a minute. Remove the pancake. 
 Keep on a plate and place the stuffing on top. 
 Tuck in the sides of the pancake to make parallel edges. 
 Roll the pancake to make a roll. Continue making the pancakes and the rolls from them. Do not allow the pancakes to cool before adding the stuffing, as this makes the pancake less malleable. 
 Finally dip each roll into the beaten  egg  and coat all round. 
 Then coat with bread crumbs and deep fry until medium brown colour.
