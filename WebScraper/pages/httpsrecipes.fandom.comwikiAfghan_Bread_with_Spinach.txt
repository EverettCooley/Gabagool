Afghan bread and the seasoning zahtar are sold at Middle Eastern markets and some well-stocked supermarkets. For the bread, you may substitute pita loavesuplan to use the two-ounce size, one loaf per serving. As an alternate to zahtar, use your favorite seasoning mix, one that has plenty of flavor. Dried fruits such as dates, raisins and apricots, plus hot tea, complement this simple, light meal.
