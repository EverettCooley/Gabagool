 About Marshmallow : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Marshmallow on Wikipedia 
 The marshmallow is a confection that, in its modern form, consists of real  sugar  or  corn syrup , beaten  egg whites ,  gelatin  that has been pre-softened in  water ,  gum arabic  and flavorings, whipped to a spongy consistency. The traditional recipe used an extract from the mucilaginous root of the marshmallow plant, a shrubby herb (Althaea officinalis), instead of gelatin; the mucilage performed as a cough suppressant.
 Commercial marshmallows are a late 19th century innovation. Since Alex Doumak's patented extrusion process of 1948, marshmallows are extruded as soft cylinders, cut in sections and rolled in a mix of finely powdered cornstarch and confectioner's sugar.
 Marshmallows are available in both regular and miniature sizes. For recipes, 1 regular size marshmallow equals approximately 10 miniature marshmallows. 
 Marshmallows are popular with children and adults alike, and are eaten with or without accompaniments. In the United States and elsewhere, marshmallows are also used in hot chocolate or caf√© mocha (mochachino), mallomars, on top of candied sweet potatoes during Thanksgiving, in Rice Krispie treats, in ice-cream flavors such as the Rocky road, and several other foodstuffs.
