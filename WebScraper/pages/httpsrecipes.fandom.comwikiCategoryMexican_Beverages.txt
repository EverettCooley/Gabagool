 Coffee is often consumed all over Mexico, as there are wide plantations in the country. In Oaxaca, all meals are accompanied by drinks, as people tend to drink more in this region. In Oaxaca, coffee is a local must and it is prepared a la olla; this means that the coffee is sweetened with cinnamon and sugar and then left to simmer in a wide bowl for many hours. The result is a very specific and intense Mexican taste. Among the alcohol beverages, tequila and marguerite have Mexican backgrounds: tequila is a national drink, served everywhere, especially on the coast and the margaritas are mixed with tamari do y mango, limon or flor de Jamaica. What makes the Mexican beverages special and easily recognizable is the fact that they all seem to have intense flavors, similar to the spicy food.
