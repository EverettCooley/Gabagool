INGREDIENTS : 
  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
  1/2 teaspoon salt  
  2 teaspoons baking powder  
  1 cup unsalted butter, room temp, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing bundt pan  
  1 3/4 cups granulated sugar  
  6 large eggs, room temperature  
  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  
  2 tablespoons dark rum (optional)  
  1 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk  
  1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 
 Instructions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter your bundt pan (12-inch) and set aside. 
 In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder. 
 In the bowl of your stand mixer or a large bowl with a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, approximately 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the vanilla extract and dark rum, mix to combine. Add in the coconut milk and mix to combine. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth. Add the shredded coconut and mix to combine. 
 Pour the batter into the bundt pan and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. 
 Cool the cake for at least an hour in the pan before turning the cake onto a wire rack to finish cooling. 
 The bundt will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for three days or in the freezer for three months. It’s also fabulous toasted.
