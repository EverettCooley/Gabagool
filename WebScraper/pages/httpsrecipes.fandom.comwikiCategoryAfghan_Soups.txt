 In traditional style, two large pots on wood-burning stoves are where Afghans cook their soups. Mostly an Afghani meal includes a bowl of soup. Spoons and forks are not used in the Afghani custom, therefore the soup is eaten by hand, normally with the traditional Afghan flat bread or Nan. Most of the Afghani soups include noodles and meat in them. The most popular soups are as follows:
 Ash : this is a traditional soup with noodle, yogurt, kidney beans and chickpeas and is flavoured with dill, turmeric, and garnished with mint leaves. 
 Aush soup : includes noodles, vegetables and yogurt and is topped with meat sauce and sprinkled with dill. 
 Vegetable soup  which is also known to be Kabulâ€™s favourite soup is a mixture of fresh vegetables and herbs.
