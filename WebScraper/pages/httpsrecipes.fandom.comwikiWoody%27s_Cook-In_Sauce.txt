I just found out from a friend and fellow Southern cook that Woody's 
sauce is no longer being made. They were out of New Orleans, and got 
bought out by another company who chose to drop the product. Woody's 
is a wonderful thick smokey sauce, not sweet at all, and it made the 
best oven brisket you ever put in your mouth. My mama swore by it, and 
Miss Ruth had used it longer than she can remember, she's 77 years 
young. My family is heartbroken, that's been a staple in our pantry 
ever since I started keeping house.
