       Prudhomme's Cajun Cauliflower in Garlic Sauce     
 A wonderful, flavorful vegetable courtesy of Chef Paul Prudhomme.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  cauliflower  florets 
 1 tablespoon  unsalted butter 
 2 teaspoons minced fresh  garlic 
 1 teaspoon  hot pepper sauce  (Tabasco) 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh  cilantro  leaves 
 Â½ teaspoon  Cajun seasoning 
 Directions : 
 Bring 1 quart of  water  to a boil in a large pot. 
 Blanch the  cauliflower  just until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. 
 Drain well and set aside. 
 Place the  butter  in a large skillet over high heat. 
 As soon as the  butter  begins to sizzle, add the  garlic . 
 Cook, stirring almost constantly, until the  garlic  is thoroughly coated with  butter , about 30 seconds. 
 Add the  cauliflower  and cook, stirring occasionally, just until the  cauliflower  is slightly browned, about 4 minutes. 
 Remove from the heat, stir in the pepper sauce,  cilantro  and Cajun spice blend, and mix gently but thoroughly. 
 Serve immediately.
