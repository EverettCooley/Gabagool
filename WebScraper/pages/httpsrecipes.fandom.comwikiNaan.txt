Naan  is an East Indian, white-flour flat bread that is lightly leavened by a natural Yeast Starter developed from airborne yeasts. Naan is traditionally baked in a Tandoor Oven. A flattened round of dough is placed on a cloth puff that is used to slap the bread directly onto the side of the special high-heat oven. In less than 60 seconds, the bread puffs slightly, browns on the side touching the oven wall and takes on a light smoky flavor. The bread is speared with a skewer and removed from the oven wall to be served hot.
