Description : 
 Dinamita  are a must for any party! Made with finger chili peppers and meat filling, they’re crispy, crunchy, slightly spicy, and the ultimate beer match!
 
 Ingredients : 
 30 pieces finger chili peppers ( siling haba ) 
 1 pound ground pork 
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 
 ½ cup green onion, chopped 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 ¼ teaspoon pepper, black only 
 30 pieces spring roll wrappers 
 canola oil 
 Instructions : 
 With a small knife, make a slit across the length of one side of each chili pepper from the stem down to the tip. Work carefully to keep stems intact. 
 Using a teaspoon, gently scrape the inside of the chili pepper to remove seeds and the pith. Rinse under cold running water to remove any stray seeds. Drain well and pat dry. 
 In a fresh bowl, combine ground pork, garlic, green onions, salt, and pepper to taste. Using a teaspoon, gently stuff each chili pepper with pork mixture. 
 Separate lumpia wrappers and lay on a flat work surface. On a flat working surface, position the spring roll in a diamond pattern. 
 Tuck and fold the right, pointed end of the wrapper inward and place the stuffed pepper horizontally with stem outside of the wrapper. 
 Fold the left and bottom sides over the chili pepper and roll tightly to fully enclose. Dab the seam with water and gently press to completely seal. 
 In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2 inches deep of oil. Add wrapped peppers in a single layer and cook, turning as needed, for about 7 to 10 minutes or until outside is golden and crisp and meat is cooked. 
 Remove from the pan and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve hot with the sweet and sour sauce or spicy vinegar dip.
