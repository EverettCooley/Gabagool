Ingredients
1 2-1/2- to 3-pound pork shoulder roast 
1 teaspoon caraway seed, crushed 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
2 tablespoons cooking oil 
1 medium onion, cut into wedges 
1 cup water 
3/4 cup apple cider or apple juice 
3 medium cooking apples, cut into wedges 
 Directions
1. Trim any visible fat from the meat. Set aside. In a small mixing
bowl combine caraway seed, salt, and black pepper. Rub over meat. 
 2. In a 4- or 6-quart pressure cooker heat 1 tablespoon of the oil
over medium heat. Cook meat until brown on all sides. Add more oil, if
needed. Remove the meat and set aside. Drain off fat. 
 3. Place the rack in the pressure cooker. Return the meat to the
pressure cooker and add the onion, water, and apple cider or apple juice. 
 4. Lock lid in place. Place pressure regulator on vent pipe (if you
have a first-generation cooker). Over high heat, bring cooker up to
pressure. Reduce heat just enough to maintain pressure and pressure
regulator rocks gently; cook for 45 minutes. 
 5. Allow pressure to come down naturally. Carefully remove lid.
Transfer meat and onion to a serving platter; keep warm. 
 6. Add apples to pressure cooker. Bring to boiling. Cover loosely (do
not lock lid) and cook over medium heat about 5 minutes or until
apples are crisp-tender. With a slotted spoon, remove apples to
serving platter. Makes 8 main-dish servings.
