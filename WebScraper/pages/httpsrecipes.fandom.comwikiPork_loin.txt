About pork loin : 
 Pork loin  is a cut of meat from a pig, created from the tissue along the top of the rib cage. It is very popular in the United States, where it is usually grilled or baked. Pork loins are also sold soaking in marinade.
 The loin joint that runs across most of the back of the pig provides a number of smaller cuts which many people are familiar with. Chops contain some bone which makes them slightly cheaper than boneless steaks. Loin provides  bacon  with varying degrees of fat running through it, from lean to streaky. These cuts are all mid-priced for  pork . For roasting, the loin joint costs a little more, but is very useful either on the bone or boned and rolled to give a piece of meat that's easily stuffed and carved.
 This can be cured to give back bacon or Canadian-style bacon. The loin and  belly  can be cured together to give a side of bacon. The loin can also be divided up into roasts (blade loin roasts, center loin roasts, and sirloin roasts come from the front, center, or rear of the loin), back  ribs  (also called baby back ribs, or riblets), pork cutlets, and  pork chops . A pork loin crown roast is arranged into a circle, either boneless or with rib bones protruding upward as points in a crown.  Pork tenderloin , removed from the loin, should be practically free of fat.
