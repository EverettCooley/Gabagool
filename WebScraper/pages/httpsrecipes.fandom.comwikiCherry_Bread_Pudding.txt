Ingredients : 
 3  eggs  or equivalent  egg substitute 
 ¼ cup dark  honey  (or 3x this if you want it sweet) 
 1½ cup non-fat plain  yogurt  (approx) 
 micro dash of  salt 
 8 slice cracked wheat  bread 
 1 cup  dried pitted cherries 
 ½ cup organic red flame  raisins 
 spice (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Boil some  water , pour over  cherries  and  raisins  to soak, set aside. 
 Beat the  eggs  and honey with a fork until well blended. 
 Stir in  yogurt  and  salt . 
 Break up about 8 slices of  cracked wheat  bread, or crumble it up, and stir in. 
 Add in plumped up  cherries  and  raisins , drain the  water  off first. 
 Pour into a greased 5" x 7" pan, or a large pie tin. 
 Bake 400°F until the aroma of bread pudding hits your nose, about 40 minutes. 
 Serve with a little  cinnamon  sprinkled on top. 
 Notes : 
 This is just right in terms of sweetness for me. In order to try to placate the  sugar  gods, I tried it out with caramel sauce, and it ruined it for me. Nothing like the taste of burnt  sugar  to dull one's taste buds. 
 
 Optionally mix some spices in with the  eggs  before baking, such as ¼ – ½ tsp of  cinnamon ,  mace ,  allspice , or  cardamom  powder.
