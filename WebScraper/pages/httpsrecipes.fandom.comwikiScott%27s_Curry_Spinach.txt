Ingredients : 
 cooked  basmati rice 
 onions 
 frozen  spinach 
 1 can creamed  corn 
 curry 
 Directions : 
 Sauté  onions  in a pan (use  broth ,  vinegar , or PAM). 
 When soft, add frozen block of chopped  spinach  (if you were clever enough to thaw it, so much the better). 
 Stir for a minute. 
 Put in pyrex pan (yes, these recipes are brought to you by Pyrex, makers of fine bakeware. Back over to you, Alex). 
 Dump one can of creamed corn on it. No, creamed corn doesn't have any cream, it is just blended. 
 Douse liberally in curry! Get good curry bulk from an Indian / Oriental market and avoid the McCormicks stuff which is 44$/lb. 
 Bake the onions, spinach, and creamed corn (with curry!) for 20 minutes on 350°F or so. 
 Serve over basmati rice or just eat out of the pan.
