Description : 
 Purchased from Zimmerman Estate in Terrell, Texas in 1989. This recipe indicates it came from an old community cookbook published in 1956. Unfortunately, doesn’t give the name of that cookbook. I made these and didn’t care for them, but had reviews from my supper club and gave the recipe to 14 different people, so must just be me.
