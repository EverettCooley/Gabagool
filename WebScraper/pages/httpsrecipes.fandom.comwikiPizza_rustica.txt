A traditional Italian food, known as Pizza Ripiena, which is most often served during the Easter holiday. Unlike the flatter surfaced pizza commonly made in homes and restaurants, Pizza Rustica resembles a pie that is filled with cheeses and meats, which may include ricotta, mozzarella, provolone, and Romano cheese combined with meats such as sausage, salami, and prosciutto, or perhaps mortadella and soppressata instead of the sausage and salami. The ingredients are then baked within a pie dough crust and covering. The dough may be either pastry dough without sugar or yeast dough, both of which encase a savory filling of meats and cheeses.
