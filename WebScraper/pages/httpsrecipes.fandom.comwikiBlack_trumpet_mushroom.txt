 About Black trumpet mushroom : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Black trumpet on Wikipedia 
 Black chanterelle – also called black trumpet, horns of plenty, or trumpets of the dead – are the common names for the edible mushroom Craterellus cornucopioides. The Cornucopia (kôr'nykō`pēə), in Greek mythology, referred to the magnificent horn of the goat (or goat of the nymph) Amalthea, that filled itself with whatever meat or drink its owner requested. It has become the symbol of plenty. The mushroom is dark coloured, almost black and looks rather unattractive, but has a very good flavour. It is hard to find because of its dark color, which easily blends in with the leaf litter on the forest floor.
 The yellowfoot or funnel chanterelle (Craterellus tubaeformis) is a yellowish-brown and trumpet-shaped chanterelle found in great numbers late in the mushroom season, thus earning the common name winter mushroom. The cap is convex and sometimes hollow down the middle, and because of this it is also known as funnel chanterelle. The gills are widely separated, and of lighter color than the cap. It grows on moss or rotten wood, and is an excellent food mushroom, especially fried or in soups.
 Both species are gathered commercially and, unlike Cantharellus, can be easily preserved by drying. Trumpet-shaped mushroom which ranges from 2-5 inches high. They are distinctively aromatic and have an elegant buttery flavor.
