Description : 
 I got this recipe from a lady who is now in her 90s and still going strong. She said this recipe came from the 1920s sometime and was used in my neck of the woods, out Barkerville way (a gold rush town from the 1890s that has been made into a tourist trap) because there were so many Chinese that came up to make there fortune, it ended up being called Chinese chews, but she swears that the name is date chewsticks.
 I have also used that  candied fruit  that is available at xmas in place of the  dates  and it is wonderful. To make it real fancy for a "do", use a paper doily before sprinkling the  icing sugar  on top. 
 
 note : no  margarine  or  shortening !!!! 
 Ingredients : 
 3  eggs 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 1 cup  dates 
 1 cup  flour 
 Directions : 
 Beat  eggs  and  sugar , add  baking powder ,  vanilla , and  flour . 
 Add the  dates  last and mix thoroughly. 
 Batter will be thick. 
 Pour into a greased 8 x 8 pan and bake at 350°F for 25 to 30 minutes. 
 When cooled sprinkle  icing sugar  over the top and rub in until completely coated with  icing sugar .
