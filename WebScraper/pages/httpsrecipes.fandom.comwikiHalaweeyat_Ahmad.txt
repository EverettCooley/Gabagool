Ingredients : 
 2 bags of Ahmad Sweyweih (toasted, very thin  vermicelli ) 
 ⅓ cup of  butter , melted 
 1 (400 gram) can of  sweetened condensed milk  (or see substitution below) 
 ½ cup of finely  ground nuts 
 ½ cup of desiccated  coconut 
 ½ cup of  powdered sugar 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  butter  in a large skillet. 
 Break the  vermicelli  into very small pieces and add to the  butter . 
 Stir over medium-low heat for two minutes, until the  butter  is well mixed in the  vermicelli . 
 Remove to a bowl. 
 Add the  nuts ,  coconut  and  sweetened condensed milk . 
 Stir with a spoon until well mixed. 
 Press into small molds: (we use the 10ml cups that come with children's medicine or the scoop from a can of baby formula) 
 First, dip the mold in the  powdered sugar , making sure to coat all of the inside of the mold. 
 Then, shake off the  powdered sugar . 
 Firmly press the mixture into the mold. 
 Turn the mold upside down and tap the top of it with a spoon, until the "halaweeyat" fall out of the mold in a nice shape. 
 Carefully place on a plate. 
 Repeat with remaining mixture. 
 Cover the "halaweeyat" and allow to sit for 2 hours (so the  vermicelli  will absorb the  sweetened condensed milk ).
