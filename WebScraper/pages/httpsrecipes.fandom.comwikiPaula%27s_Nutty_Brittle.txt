 Contributed by  Catsrecipes Y-Group 
 Ingredients : 
 2½ cups  sugar 
 1¼ cups  light corn syrup 
 1 cup  water 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 ½ cup  pecans 
 ½ cup  cashews 
 ½ cup  macadamia nuts 
 ½ cup  almonds 
 4 tablespoons  butter 
 3 teaspoons  baking soda 
 Directions : 
 In a nonstick saucepan, heat and stir sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt over medium heat until sugar has dissolved. 
 Over high heat, using a candy thermometer, cook sugar mixture to a hard crack stage (290°F). 
 Add nuts and butter and cook to 300°F stirring all the time to keep the nuts from burning. 
 Pull off heat at 300°F and stir in baking soda while beating to a froth for 30 seconds. 
 Pour at once on to 4 well buttered 15½ by 10 by 1-inch pans. 
 Spread with a spatula as thin as possible. 
 As the brittle cools you may use gloves to hand stretch the brittle which will give it a better eating quality. 
 This brittle has a great shelf life, if kept in air tight zip locks or containers, it will keep for 2 months.
