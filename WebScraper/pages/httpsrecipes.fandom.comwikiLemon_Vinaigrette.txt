 Description : 
 This tangy vinaigrette is made and packed with real vinegar and fruit juice, absolutely like most vinaigrettes, and is used for salads and the marinade, as it has a higher hint of Dijon mustard and keeps a sour taste with the lemon content.

 ½ cup  olive oil 
 1 ⅞ teaspoon vinegar, white only 
 3 tablespoons fresh  lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon minced  shallot 
 1½ teaspoons  Dijon mustard 
 ½ teaspoon grated  lemon peel 
 ½ teaspoon  sugar , brown only 
 Directions : 
 Whisk all ingredients in a bowl to blend. 
 Season with salt and pepper. Pour or scoop the lemon-based vinaigrette into a plastic bottle. 
 Use as a salad dressing or a dip. Reserve this vinaigrette in a refrigerator.
