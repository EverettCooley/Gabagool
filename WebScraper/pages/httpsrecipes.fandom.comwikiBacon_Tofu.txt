 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1	tbl	 chili powder 
 1	tbl	 cumin 
 1	tsp	 salt 
 1Â lb	 tofu 
 Directions : 
 We mix a lb. of  tofu  with a tablespoon each of  chile powder  and  cumin , and a teaspoon of  salt . Mash (or process) it all up and cook it over an extremely low light for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally, ending up with it so dry there's no sensible moisture and it seems to keep indefinitely without refrigeration. 
 We grind it up and have what we think is a good meat substitute for  Pasta  sauces, tacos/burritos,  Potato  topping, or even mixing in slaws/salads.
