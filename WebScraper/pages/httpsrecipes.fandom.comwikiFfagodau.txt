Welsh Meatballs
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  beef  or  pork   liver 
 2 lbs  ground pork , lean 
 ½ c  breadcrumbs 
 2 medium  onions , finely chopped 
 2 tsp. dried  sage 
 2 tsp. dried  thyme 
 2 tsp. dried  parsley 
 pinch of  nutmeg 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 3 ounces  suet 
 flour  for dusting 
 non-stick  cooking spray 
 flour  or  cornstarch  for gravy 
 Directions : 
 Finely chop the beef or pork liver and rinse with water. 
 Mix in a bowl with ground pork, bread crumbs, onions, sage, thyme, parsley, nutmeg and salt and pepper. 
 Dust the bottom of another bowl with flour, and add the suet to lightly coat. 
 Add the suet to the meat mixture and combine thoroughly. 
 Form meat into walnut-sized balls. 
 Arrange meatballs in a baking dish coated with non-non-stick cooking spray; cover with foil and bake in a preheated 400° oven for forty minutes. 
 Remove foil and drain off the fat; thicken the fat with flour or cornstarch to make a gravy (adding whichever thickener you choose one teaspoon at a time until desired consistency), and pour the gravy around the meat. 
 Cut meatloaf into slices and serve hot.
