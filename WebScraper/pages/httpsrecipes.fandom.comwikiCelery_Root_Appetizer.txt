 Description : 
 Celery root  and  leeks  also make home fries into a sophisticated side dish for dinner.
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 medium  leeks  (about 1½ pounds) white and light-green parts only cut into ¼-inch-thick rounds 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 medium all-purpose  potatoes  (about 12 ounces) peeled and cut into matchsticks 
 1  celery root  (about 1 pound) peeled and cut into matchsticks (1 inch long by ¼ inch wide) 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh  rosemary 
 1 tablespoon reduced  pomegranate juice  ( lemon juice   or   vinegar ) 
 coarse salt  and freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Place sliced  leeks  in a large bowl of cold  water . Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to rid them of dirt and sand. Lift out of  water  with a slotted spoon, and drain. 
 In a large nonstick skillet, heat  olive oil  over medium-high heat. Add  leeks  and other remaining ingredients, and cook, turning the vegetables frequently, until browned, about 15 minutes. 
 Reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings; serve immediately.
