 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 lb  Bacon 
 10 	baby  carrots , chopped 
 1 	 red onion , diced 
 1 lb split  Peas , sorted and rinsed 
 1 	teaspoon dried  thyme 
 7 	cups  water 
 2 	 bay leaves 
 salt 
 sour cream 
 Tabasco sauce  or hot sauce, of choice 
 fresh  chives , chopped 
 Directions : 
 In a very large, deep saucepan cook the  Bacon  till it's done enough to crumble a little, (about 15 minutes over medium heat). 
 Remove  Bacon , break or chop it up coarsely and set aside. 
 Add the  carrots ,  Onion ,  thyme , and  bay leaves  to the pan toss to coat with pan drippings that remained from the  Bacon  cooking. 
 Cook 5 mintues over med-high heat. 
 Add split  Peas  and cooked  Bacon , stir well and cook another 5 minutes. 
 Add 8 cups of  water  and bring just to a high boil, then reduce heat and simmer. 
 When the  Peas  have absorbed about half the  water , add  salt  to taste (the taste of the mixture at this point will be an accurate indicator of how salty the final product will be). 
 Continue to simmer until the  Peas  are very, very soft and almost all the  water  has been absorbed;Any  water  left should be the color of the  Peas , and thickened. 
 Stir and check often to ensure the bottom does not burn, especially toward the end of cook time. 
 If you like a smoother soup, you may choose to puree the mixture a bit with hand mixer before serving. 
 Remove  bay leaves  and place soup in bowls. Garnish each with a dollop of  sour cream , a couple splashes of hot sauce, and  chives .
