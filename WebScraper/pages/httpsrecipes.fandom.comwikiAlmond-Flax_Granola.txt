       Almond-Flax Granola     
 Ingredients : 
 4 cup  rolled oats 
 1 cup raw  wheat germ 
 1 cup sliced  almonds 
 1 cup raw  sunflower seeds 
 ½ cup  flax seeds 
 1½ tsp  cinnamon 
 1½ tsp ground  ginger 
 ¼ tsp ground  nutmeg 
 ½ cup  apple juice 
 ¼ cup  blackstrap molasses 
 ¼ cup  safflower oil 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 1 tsp  almond extract 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, place the rolled  oats ,  wheat germ ,  almond ,  sunflower seeds ,  flax seed ,  cinnamon ,  ginger , and  nutmeg , and toss well to combine. 
 In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine. 
 Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir well to thoroughly moisten the dry ingredients. 
 Transfer the granola mixture to the prepared cookie sheets, evenly dividing it between the two pans, and spreading it to form a single layer. 
 Bake at 300 °F for 20 minutes. 
 Remove the cookie sheets from the oven, stir the granola mixture, spread it out to form a single layer again, switch the placement of the cookie sheets on the racks, and bake the granola mixture an additional 20 minutes. 
 Repeat the stirring and spreading procedure, as needed, until the granola mixture is dry and golden brown. 
 Remove the cookie sheets from the oven and set the granola aside to cool completely. 
 Transfer the granola to an airtight container and can store at room temperature for 4 to 6 weeks.
