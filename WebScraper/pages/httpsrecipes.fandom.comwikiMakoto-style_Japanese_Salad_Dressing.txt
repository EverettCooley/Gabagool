Description : 
       Makoto-style Japanese Salad Dressing     
 This recipe is kind of a copy cat of a dressing from a local restaurant that, in the last few years has been available by the bottle in local supermarkets. I have been to MANY a Japanese restaurant and I have had yet to find a dressing I enjoy as much as this one....most are too sweet and cloying for my taste. I think this recipe is pretty close to the original (which if you haven't tasted it, it is hard to appreciate how close it really is). I hope you enjoy it!
