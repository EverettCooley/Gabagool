 Ingredients : 
 1 can  coconut milk  (either regular or light) 
 1½  onions  chopped fine 
 1 tsp  cumin  seeds 
 10 – 12 whole  peppercorns 
 4  dried red chillies 
 3 – 4 cloves  garlic  smashed 
 5 – 6  curry leaves  (optional) 
 salt  to taste 
 ¼ tsp  vinegar 
 light  green squash  (dudhi- in Hindi, can be purchased from the Indian store) 
 about 4 tbsp  oil  for the  curry 
 about 2 tbsp  oil  for the choak (I use  olive oil  because it is healthier. coconut  oil  and canola can also be used) 
 Directions : 
 The  curry : 
 Heat  oil  in a vessel. 
 Add  onions  and fry until pink. 
 Add  coconut milk . 
 Reduce heat to med. 
 Wait until the coconut milk comes to boil. 
 Add  vinegar  while stirring continuously to prevent curdling. 
 Add veggies and leave to cook on med to low heat. 
 The Choak : 
 During the time the veggies are cooking, heat  oil  in a tadka spoon or another vessel. 
 Add the remaining ingredients to the hot  oil  that is, ½ tsp  cumin  seeds,  peppercorns , red chillies,  curry leaves  and smashed  garlic . 
 When the  garlic  turns a med to dark brown and all the other whole spices release their flavour, throw this mixture into the  curry  and give in a stir and cook until veggies are done. 
 Eat with hot  rice .
