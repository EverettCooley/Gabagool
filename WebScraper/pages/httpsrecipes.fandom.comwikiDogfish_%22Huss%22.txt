 ½ teaspoon  house seasoning

 Description :

 Next cut from anus to jaw line, then cut the gill to centerline cut just made. 
 Clean the innards out. 
 Next step down on head or hang head from hook penetrating the cartilaginous "back bone". 
 Grab on to the flap created when cutting from gill to centerline and pull off skin.

 In a large pot or Dutch oven heat oil to 375°F.

 Sift 1½ cups flour into the bowl, whisking in gently until just combined, stir in house seasoning. 
 Pat fish dry and season on both sides with salt and pepper and coat the fish in the beer batter. 
 Dredge the pieces of fish in ½ cup of remaining flour and slide into oil as coated. 
 Fry fish, turning over frequently, until deep golden and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. 
 Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
