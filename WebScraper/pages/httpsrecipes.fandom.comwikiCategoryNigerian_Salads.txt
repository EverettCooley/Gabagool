 A typical Nigerian salad may vary as much as from vegetable mixes, to sardines, corned beef, hardboiled eggs and baked beans blended with lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes and onions, to even more consistent meat salads, and even fruit salads served as desserts.
 More consistent salads include the wild and brown rice salad, shrimp salad, coconut rice and moi-moi salad. Goat and chicken meat can be used for salads, and seasoning such as lemon, garlic and chili sauces are used to give a special flavor to he whole dish.
 Exotic fruits like mango, avocado, pineapples, and bananas, may consist of a great salad, and can be served with whipped cream or ice-cream. The papaya salad is one of the most common fruit salads and is very much appreciated in the Nigerian cuisine. Other salads include tarragon orange salad, and the coconut shrimp and rice salad.
