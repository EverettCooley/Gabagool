 About Hard cider : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Hard cider on Wikipedia 
 Cider (known in parts of North America as hard cider, and also spelled cyder) is an alcoholic beverage made from apples. In Europe and Oceania, "cider" refers to fermented apple juice. In the United States and parts of Canada the same drink is known as "hard cider", with "cider" referring to an unfermented (non-alcoholic) drink that is a subtype of apple juice.
 Cider is often stronger than beer, and is frequently over 6% alcohol by volume (ABV). The common eating apples are unsuitable for cidermaking, being low in tannins; specific apple cultivars bred especially for cidermaking are preferred.
