 Whether you are trying the sweet and tasty fried bananas (Beyen) or the traditional sweet potato bread (Pain patate) you will notice that Haitian desserts tend to be the perfect final course of a delicious meal. Other popular Haitian desserts include sweet potato pie, coconut pudding, and banana fritters. Coconuts are used extensively in several other dessert types. The most common elements for an authentic Haitian dessert are the bananas and the mashed fruits or vegetables, similar to puree. The banana dessert is among the most famous exotic Caribbean desserts and it is easily prepared in half an hour. The bananas are first washed for 15 minutes, while a large banana leaf is oiled and fried and then the cooked bananas are dripped and sugar and vanilla are added and mixed together, then spread on the banana leaf.
