      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 This is yet another great Saturday-night dish - perfect for taking into your living room in a plate - sitting on sofa, plate in one hand - spoon in the other - and tucking in whilst watching a great suspense or action thriller film on the TV. With gorgeously tender pieces of  Lamb , mildly spiced and coated in fluffy  basmati rice  - nothing beats this on a cold winter's evening in London!
 The problem is that the traditional method of cooking biryani dishes involves a lot of preparation and a lot of hassle "layering" part-cooked  rice  and meat in an oven-proof tray (or casserole dish) and then sticking in oven etc. Here in the busy Route79 household we just don't have the precious time - and nor do we like the idea of using up half a kitchen's worth of utensils just to make one dish!
 So - here is a much easier method - and only involves one stove-top pot and some ingredients that you should definitely find lurking in your cupboards or fridge. All you need is some  Lamb  (or  Chicken  if you like) !!
 
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Here is what you need to make  Lamb  Biryani for two very generous servings:
 
 around 300 grams of  leg of lamb  - chopped into small pieces. 
 the usual chunks of frozen pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and  chile  from your freezer. 
 2 teaspoons  salt . 
 1 teaspoon haldi ( turmeric ) 
 3 teaspoons  garam masala 
 2 teaspoons  ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons ground  cumin 
 2 dessert spoons of plain natural  yoghurt 
 a few dashes of  vinegar 
 2 medium  onions  - chopped along the grain - long 
 4 smallish  tomatoes  - deseeded and chopped relatively finely 
 4 mediumish white  mushrooms  - chopped finely 
 pinch of  cumin  seeds 
 3  bay leaves 
 1 mug of  basmati rice 
 
 
 Directions : 
 As I mentioned earlier - you can use  Chicken  instead of  Lamb  if you like - in fact you can use practically anything -  Turkey  chunks, non-flaky fish (e.g. monkfish) - or even vegetables etc. But if you do use  Lamb  - please be sure to use leg of  Lamb  only. This will result in a fabulously tender and tasty bite in the end-product. I know that  Lamb  leg is expensive - but if you go down your High Street butcher you will almost certainly find it a lot cheaper (and fresher) - and if the butcher is an Asian/Indian one then you can also get it deboned, de-fatted and chopped up for you at no extra charge. For example - I went down my local High Street butcher - pointed at my choice of whole  Lamb  leg in the see-through cabinet and asked him for half of it - which he took to a sawing machine and cut up - and then chopped it all up for me. I purchased 1 kilogram - but you only need to use about a third of that for this recipe. (I'm using the rest for something else you see!). I Paid a total of £6.40 for 1 kilo - which I believe is far cheaper than Safeway or Asda.
 Anyway - make sure the  Lamb  pieces are chopped small - about the size of a heaped teaspoon each or thereabouts. And now for the action ...
 Get a glass bowl. In it put the two dessert-spoons of natural  yoghurt . Put in all the spices as per the amounts listed above including a few dashes of  vinegar  - and then stir it all up. (If you, like me, are using chunks of frozen pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie - then be sure to defrost the chunks by zapping then for 20 seconds on high power in the microwave first.)
 
       Put all ingredients in a glass bolw     
         Mix it all about     
 Then add the  Lamb  pieces and stir it all up so that every piece is coated well. At this point you have two choices: you can either clingfilm the bowl and stick it in the fridge for a couple of hours - or you can proceed straight on to the next stage. I would reccomend marinating for a couple of hours - as this will result in a quicker cook time later - and a more flavourful dish too. But - it is not essential.
 
         Add the lamb pieces and stir/coat well     
         Cover with clingfilm and put in fridge     
 Now prepare the rest of the stuff. Slice and cut the  onions  vertically so you end up with long thin strips. Chop the  Mushrooms  and  tomatoes . The latter two things shound be done relatively finely. Also - get your  bay leaves  and pinch of  cumin  seeds ready for the stove-top action.
 
         Other ingredients     
         Other ingredients     
 Put about 1 tablespoon of  vegetable oil  into a non-stick pan - on high flame - and throw in the  cumin  seeds. Wait until they start to splutter - and then add the chopped  onions . Lower the flame to medium and fry this for around 10 mins until the  onions  are browned.
 
         Fry the cumin seeds until they splutter. Then add onions     
         Fry the onions until browned     
 Then add the chopped  tomato  - immediately followed by the marinated  Lamb . Turn up the flame at this point to high. Stir it all around.
 
         Then add the chopped tomato     
         Then add the marinated lamb     
 Then add the  Mushrooms  and the bayleaves. Ensure everything is mixed up.
 
         Then add the chopped mushrooms     
         Stir it all around and add the bay leaves     
 Basically - you've got to stir-fry it on high heat for around 5 mins. This will allow the  garlic  and  ginger  in the marinade to cook properly. You can then lower the flame so that the mixture is simmering - stick the lid on and let it slowly cook for around 20 or 30 minutes. This is the stage at which you have to ensure that the  Lamb  is tender - and that the spice mixture tastes right. Don't be afraid of too much  salt  at this point - because when the  rice  is added - the  salt  will be diluted. Whilst the  Lamb  is cooking - prepare the  basmati rice  by washing it in cold  water  throughly several times. I use the sieve/bowl in the sink under cold running  water  technique which you can see in the "Vegetable  rice " recipe.
 When the  Lamb  is cooked tender - add the washed and drained  rice  to the pot.
 
 
         Stir fry it for about 5 minutes on high heat; Then lower heat, put lid on and let it simmer for around 20-30 minutes     
         When lamb is tender, add the rice     
 Now add a little  water  to the pot - NOT the usual twice-the-amount-of-water-as- rice  amount - but instead only enough to cover the surface of the  rice  by just over half a centimetre. Then put the lid on. This will be the last time you see the inside of the pot until it's done! Bring the pot to fierce boil and then immediately transfer to a very-low-flame burner and let it simmer there for around 20 minutes. Whatever you do - DO NOT TAKE THE LID OFF TO SEE HOW IT'S DOING ! Every bit of steam in the pot is needed to work its magic on the  rice ! Trust me: you will ruin it if you keep taking the lid off. Go make side-salad to keep yourself occupied whilt the  rice  is cooking!
 
 
         Stir it up - coating rice and add some water     
         Put lid on. Bring the fierce boil and then transfer to VERY low flame. Let simmer for 20 minutes. DO NOT TAKE LID OFF!
