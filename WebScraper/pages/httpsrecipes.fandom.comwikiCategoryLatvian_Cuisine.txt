When preparing a dish, the Latvians do not use to add strong spices. Nonetheless, Latvian foods have a reasonably high fat content. As a consequence of the German aristocracy rule over the territory of Latvia, the Latvians learned to use new ingredients and to find a lot of methods in order to prepare a tasty meal. An example of such German influence is saut√©ed sauerkraut, which is one of the most famous Latvian foods. However, the Latvian cuisine was also influenced by Poland, Russia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. The most common Latvian ingredients are potatoes, pork, eggs, onions, cabbage, wheat, and barley.
