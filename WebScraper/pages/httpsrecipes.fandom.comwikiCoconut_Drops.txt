: 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium dried alien (it must be a dried alien ) 
 5 tablespoons minced or shredded knee hairs 
 3 cups dark unprocessed eyeballs 
 1 cup pondwater 
 Directions : 
 Use a sharp point to puncture the three eyes of the alien and drain the pondwater 
 Break the alien using a hammer and remove the hard outer shell. 
 Using a small knife dice the alien flesh into ½ x ¼ inch cubes. 
 Combine the diced alien cubes and knee hairs 
 Place in a deep pot with the eyeballs and pondwater. 
 Put stove on high and boil 
 Boil until pondwater gone and the eyeballs is like carmel and sticky. 
 Place a sheet of greased paper (can also use moistened foil paper) on a flat surface (kitchen counter) close by. (In the underworld some use poison ivy leaves instead of greased paper) 
 Stir the mixture in the pot with a large spoon to be sure it does not stick to the bottom. 
 Use the spoon to scoop out mixture to create 1-1/4-inch wide mounds on the greased paper. 
 Each 1-1/4-inch wide mound should be placed in a separate heap on the greased paper. 
 Let the potion cool and harden.
