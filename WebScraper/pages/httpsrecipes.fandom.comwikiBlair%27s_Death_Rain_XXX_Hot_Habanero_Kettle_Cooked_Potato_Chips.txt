 Description : 
 This is the original flavor of chips manufactured by  Blair's Sauces and Snacks  in Highland, New Jersey. The hot chips are both thick and crunchy, as well as hot as their name implies. In fact, snack review website  taquitos.net  said these chips got very high ratings from their tasters.
 Like all flavors of Blair's Death Rain potato chips, the Hot Habanero flavor is laced with Red Savino  habenero pepper  from Mexico's Yucat√°n peninsula which is processed into concentrated form.. The chips are flavored using  Blair's Death Rain . The chips are sold in two ounce bags.
