Ingredients : 
 10 (or more) cloves of  garlic , pressed 
 3 tbsp  capers  plus a bit of caper liquid (more if you love  capers ) 
 1 tbsp  basil 
 1 tbsp  rosemary , crushed 
 1 cup  water 
 lemon juice  to taste 
 3 large  red peppers , sliced thinly 
 1 box wide spinach  noodles  (24 oz) 
 Directions : 
 Sauté  garlic , herbs and  capers  by your favorite sauté method. 
 Add  water  and  red peppers , and simmer the  red peppers  until they are slightly softened. 
 A bit of crunch is a good thing. 
 There should be a fair amount of liquid left when you are done simmering. 
 Cook some wide  spinach  noodles (I used 24 oz for five of us) until they are just a hair underdone and then drain. 
 Toss them with the  peppers  and liquid over a low heat until  pasta  is coated and liquid is absorbed.
