 About ambarella : 
 Spondias dulcis or ambarella, (and its alternative binomial, Spondias cytherea, Malay Apple), or just Golden apple, is an equatorial or tropical tree, with edible fruit containing a fibrous pit. It is known by many names, including pommecythere in Trinidad and Tobago, juplon in Costa Rica; and in Brazil, caja-manga. Its fruit may be eaten raw; the flesh is crunchy and a little sour. 
 Yet another fruit introduced from the Pacific by Captain Bligh, the pear-shaped otaheiti apple ranges from pink to ruby red in color. This fruit is usually eaten fresh, though it can be packed in red wine or turned into a refreshing cold drink.
