 2 Lb Braising  Steak , cut into 2-inch strips 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 2  garlic  cloves, crushed

 Reduce the heat, partially cover the pan and simmer gently for about 2 hours, keeping an eye on the  water  level and topping up when necessary, until meat is very tender and can be shredded with a fork. 
 Preheat the oven to 400F and grease a wide shallow baking pan. Remove the meat from the saucepan and shred into thin strips using two forks. The meat should be soft enough to pull apart very easily.
