 About Textured soy protein : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Textured soy protein on Wikipedia 
 Textured vegetable protein, also known as textured soy protein (TSP) is a meat substitute made from defatted soy flour, a by-product of making soybean oil. It is quick to cook, high in protein, and low in fat.
 TSP is made through a process known as "extrusion cooking". A dough is formed from high PDI (Protein Dispersibility Index) defatted soy flour and water in a "preconditioner" (mixing cylinder) and cooked during passage through the barrel of a screw type extruder such as the Wenger. Sometimes steam from an external source is employed to aid in the cooking process. Upon exiting the die, superheated steam escapes rapidly producing an expanded- spongy yet fibrous lamination of thermoplastic soy flour which takes on the various shapes of the die as it is sliced by revolving knives; granules, flakes, chunks, goulash, steakettes (schnitzel), etc., and then dried in an oven. Had the raw material been high in carbohydrates, extrusion cooking could have produced puffed corn curls or puffed wheat.
