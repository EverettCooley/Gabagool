 Description : 
 Making  sausage  from fresh  pork  allows cooks to choose the cuts they want. Many lean  pork  cuts work well for  sausage , including trimmed boneless shoulder, trimmed loin or sirloin or even tenderloin. Making your own  sausage  also allows the cook to control the seasonings and added  salt , or even omitting  salt  altogether.
