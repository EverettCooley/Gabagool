      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 If you were to do a search on the Internet for "Southern Fried  Chicken " you would probably find all sorts of controversial debate about the history of this dish - and how it should be cooked. It seems that it probably originated in the southern USA (obviously) - but by Scottish settlers in the 19th century. Whereas the English generally preferred to boil, bake or roast their  Chicken  - the Scottish apparently used to like to fry theirs.
 Anyway - regardless of the history or the method - here is the Route 79 21st Century London Indian style method of cooking KFC (Kentucky Fried  Chicken ). It's really simple and only takes around 40 minutes in total.
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 These are the ingredients:
For the batter:
 
 6 to 8  chicken  thighs - skinless ( make sure they are skinless and are thighs  - see a previous recipe on  chicken  for the reasons why.) 
 a bit of  plain flour  (say a couple of tablespoons) 
 same amount of  cornmeal  (coarse version - otherwise known as  polenta ) 
 and whatever spices you have at hand - e.g.  garam masala , tandoori  masala  - whatever. 
 some  salt  and  pepper 
 one  egg  - and a glug of  milk 
 Directions : 
 What you do first is to prepare the coating for the  Chicken  - which is in two parts: the spicy  flour  is just a combining of the  flour  and  cornmeal  with a mixing in of a couple of heaped teaspoons of spices each - e.g.  garam masala , tandoori  masala ,  chilli powder  - and then a teaspoon or two of  salt  - and some crushed  black pepper  too. The second part of the coating is the liquid bit - just beat an  egg  and add the glug of  milk  and beat it some more.
 Then you simply coat the  Chicken  pieces in the  egg / milk  mixture. By the way - you don't need to do this at all - I just find that it comes out better. If you do this - then don't be afraid to get your hands "dirty" - just pick up the  Chicken  pieces with your fingers and turn them around a few times in a dish to ensure that they are well coated.
 
       Mix the dry ingredients together; Beat the egg and add some milk     
         Coat the chicken in egg-milk mixture     
 The next step is to coat the pieces in the spicy  flour . Once again - use your hand: pick up each  Chicken  piece - dip it into the spicy  flour  mix bowl - turning over several times and then arrange onto a flat plate ready to be fried in the next stage. Whilst you are coating the  Chicken  you might want to heat the  oil  (4 or 5 tablespoons) in the largest frying pan you've got. Also put the oven on 200 Celsius - so that it preheats whilst the  Chicken  is frying.
 
         Thoroughly coat the chicken pieces in the spicy flour     
         Heat some oil in the frying pan     
 Now add the  Chicken  pieces to the frying pan - if the  oil  is hot - the pieces should start sizzling stratight away - and some of the  Chicken  juices may start to evaporate - that's fine. Just let them stay still in the frying pan for around 5 minutes - and then turn them over - and leave them frying for another 5 minutes.
 
 
         Sizzle the chicken pieces for about 5 minutes each side     
         Should look like this after a while     
 Then finish the  Chicken  off by taking them out of the frying pan and putting them into the hot oven - for a further 25 minutes or so - turning halfway again.
 
         Stick in hot oven to finish off     
         Place into foil/tissue lined platter
