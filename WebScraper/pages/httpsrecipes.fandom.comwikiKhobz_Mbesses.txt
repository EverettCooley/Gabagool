Description : 
 Algerian semolina cake with eggs
 
 Ingredients : 
 400 gr of durum wheat  semolina  flour 
 2  eggs 
 1Â½ cups of tepid  milk 
 1 packet of  yeast 
 2 cups of  sugar 
 1 cup of  honey 
 150 g of  almonds  as an optional garnish 
 water 
 2 tablespoons of  butter 
 Directions : 
 Knead the  flour ,  eggs ,  sugar ,  milk  and  yeast  together with some  water  until the ingredients are incorporated. 
 The dough should be wetter and looser than a  bread dough . 
 Heat a skillet for just a minute and add the  butter . 
 Remove pan from heat. 
 Press the dough down into the skillet. 
 Cover the dough with plastic or a slightly damp towel and let it rise at room temperature until approximately double in size. 
 Cook on very, very low heat. 
 The cake will rise to about double in volume. 
 When fully cooked it will become firm. 
 Turn over and brown the other side for about 10 minutes. 
 Brush the top with warmed honey this will obviously moisten the cake. 
 You can add  orange flower water  or  rose water  to the honey if you like. 
 Garnishing with  almonds  is optional. 
 You can also toast the  almonds  if you like.
