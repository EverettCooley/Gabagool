 Meanwhile, fry the  bacon  in a skillet until it is crisp but not dry. 
 Remove from the heat and place the  bacon  on paper towels. 
 Pour off all but 3 to 4 tablespoons of the rendered  bacon fat . 
 Add the cubed bread to the pan and toss to coat. 
 Season with  salt  and  pepper  and transfer the bread cubes to a baking sheet.
