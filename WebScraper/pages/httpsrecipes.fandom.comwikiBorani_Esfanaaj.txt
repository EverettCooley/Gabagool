This is a variation of a dish I love. It makes a great dip when  yogurt cheese  is substituted for regular  yogurt . 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â kg fresh  spinach 
 250 g  yogurt 
 2  onions , thinly sliced 
 4 cloves  garlic , finely chopped 
 oil 
 salt 
 black pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wash  spinach  and cut into small pieces. 
 Fry  onions  and  garlic  in  oil  until slightly golden. 
 Add  spinach  and fry together over medium heat until cooked. 
 Let it cool down completely in the refrigerator. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to  yogurt  to taste and beat well until the  yogurt  is a free-flowing liquid. 
 Add  spinach  to  yogurt  and mix well. The mix should be thick and homogeneous.
