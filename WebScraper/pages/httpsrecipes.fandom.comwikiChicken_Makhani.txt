Ingredients : 
 2 pounds of (bony)  chicken 
 1 cup  yogurt  (dahi) 
 1" piece of  ginger 
 8 cloves  garlic 
 2 tbsp  lime juice 
 4" stick of  cinnamon 
 8  cloves 
 8  cardamoms 
 10  black peppercorns 
 1 tbsp  oil 
 2¼ pounds  tomatoes 
 1 tsp dried  fenugreek leaves  (optional) 
 1 tbsp  white pepper  powder (essential) 
 1 ounce  cream  (optional but recommended for a touch of class) 
 1 !!pound!!  butter  (you can get away with 0.6 lb if 1 lb is too much) 
 salt  to taste if you use yellow  butter , then scale down the  salt  accordingly. If you use white  butter , then you will need more  salt . 
 coriander ( cilantro ): optional topping. 
 Directions : 
 Clean  chicken  and remove the skin. 
 Make a smooth paste of  yogurt ,  garlic ,  ginger ,  lime juice ,  cinnamon , cloves, cardamoms, peppercorns and the  oil . 
 Marinate the  chicken  in this for 6 hours. 
 Bake the  chicken  in a preheated oven for 10 minutes at 250°F (130°C). Put it aside. 
 We need to get a  tomato  sauce. 
 Cut  tomatoes , put 'em in a pan (no  water ) and boil. 
 When the quantity has dropped by half, strain through a fine sieve. 
 What comes out of the sieve is the  tomato  sauce (this is hard work with a clumsy sieve). 
 Take a pan, start heating the sauce, add the  butter . 
 When the  butter  is melted, add the  white pepper  powder,  salt ,  fenugreek leaves  and  cream . 
 Mix the  chicken  pieces into this sauce. 
 You may like chopped coriander ( cilantro ) as topping. 
 Serve hot. 
 This works best with good  rice  (i.e. basmati).
