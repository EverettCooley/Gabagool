 Ingredients : 
 1 block extra firm (compressed)  tofu 
 soy sauce or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos 
 water 
 
 2 - 3 stalks of  celery 
 1 small  red onion 
 1 roasted* red pepper 
 
 1/2 - 1 cup  walnut  halves 
 1/4 cup fresh  tarragon , finely chopped 
 1 tsp each of  basil ,  sage ,  rosemary ,  thyme  and  oregano 
 2 tsp  paprika 
 sea salt  and  cayenne pepper , to taste 
 1 1/2 cups vegan  mayo 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 400 F. Lightly  oil  a cookie sheet. Slice the  tofu  1/4” thick. Place in a shallow dish and cover with a mixture of 1 part soy sauce to 4 parts  water . Allow to marinate 10–30 minutes. Place on the baking sheet and bake 20–30 minutes until it is a deep, golden brown and crispy. Remove and allow to cool, then shred (either with a sharp knife or your own hands) into irregular pieces. 
 Finely dice all veggies. 
 Combine all ingredients and chill completely (overnight is best). Serve on its own, or in big crusty rolls with all the sandwich fixin’s. 
 To roast  red peppers , place them on a baking sheet in a preheated 400 F oven, turning frequently until the skin blisters on all sides. Remove from the oven and place in a paper bag. Close tightly and allow to sit for 20 or more minutes until the skins “sweat off”. Peel loose skins off, remove seeds and ribs and discard. Use as desired.
