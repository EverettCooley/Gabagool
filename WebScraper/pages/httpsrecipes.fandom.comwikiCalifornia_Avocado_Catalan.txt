Description : 
 The flavors of southern Spain permeate this dish. The sauce is thick, crunchy, and aromatic. You can use  anchovies  that are packed in  olive oil  and chop them very fine, to a paste. If you use the salt-packed  anchovies , be sure to fillet them and rinse well. The  almonds  do not have to be blanched; in fact, sliced natural  almonds  are ideal.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup mild  olive oil 
 ¼ cup  sherry vinegar 
 ¼ cup (or to taste) fresh  orange juice 
 ¾ cup  sliced almonds , toasted and coarsely chopped 
 2 tbsp  capers , drained, rinsed, and chopped medium fine 
 2 tbsp grated  orange zest 
 1 tbsp puréed  or  finely chopped  anchovies 
 salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste 
 2 ripe  California avocados 
 1 small  head lettuce   or  2 small bunches  watercress , large stems trimmed 
 Directions : 
 Just toast them in a 350 °F oven until golden, about 7 minutes. 
 Whisk all the ingredients except the avocados and  lettuce  together. 
 Divide the  lettuce  among 4 salad plates. 
 Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits and peels, then cut into slices or chunks. 
 Place the avocados on the  lettuce  and spoon the vinaigrette over top.
