 Ingredients : 
 2  eggs 
 2 tsp  caster sugar 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 ½ cup  milk 
 4 tsp  oil 
 2½ cups  plain flour 
 ¼ cup  plain flour  for kneading 
 ½ tsp ground  cardamom 
 oil  for deep-frying 
 1 cup icing ( confectioners' ) sugar 
 ½ tsp ground  cardamom  (optional) 
 ½ cup finely chopped  pistachios 
 Directions : 
 Beat  eggs  until frothy, beat in  sugar  and  salt . 
 Stir in  milk  and  oil . 
 Sift  flour , add half to  egg  mixture and blend in with wooden spoon. 
 Gradually stir in remainder of  flour , holding back about ½ cup. 
 Turn onto floured board and dust with some of reserved  flour . 
 Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and glossy, using more  flour  as required. 
 Dough will still be slightly sticky. 
 Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 2 hours. 
 Take a piece of dough about the size of a large  hazelnut  and roll out on a floured board to a circle about 8–10 cm (3-4 inches) in diameter. 
 Gather up dough on one side and pinch, forming a shape resembling an elephant ear. 
 Place on a cloth and cover. 
 Repeat with remaining dough. 
 Deep fry one at a time in  oil , heated to 190 °C (375 °F) turning to cook evenly. 
 Fry until golden, do not over-brown. 
 As dough is rather elastic, the pastry tends to contract with handling, so just before dropping pastry into hot  oil , pull out lightly with fingers to enlarge. 
 Drain pastries on paper towels. 
 Sift  icing sugar  with  cardamom  if used and dust pastries with mixture. 
 Sprinkle with  nuts  and serve warm or cold. 
 Store in a sealed container. 
 Alternative topping: make a syrup with 1 cup  sugar  and ½ cup  water . 
 Bring to the boil when  sugar  is dissolved and boil for 5 minutes. 
 Dribble syrup onto warm pastries and sprinkle with  cardamom  and  nuts .
