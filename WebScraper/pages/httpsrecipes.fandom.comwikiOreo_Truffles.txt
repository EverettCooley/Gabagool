 Ingredients : 
 1 large package of  Oreos 
 1 x 8-ounce package  cream cheese , softened 
 1Â½ bags of  white chocolate  morsels or  baking chocolate 
 Directions : 
 Chop up a whole package of Oreos into a large bowl. 
 After all the Oreos are finely chopped, use your hands and mix the cream cheese to the Oreos. 
 You should have a big ball of chocolate! use a mini scoop to make balls and then roll the balls in your hands like a meatball. 
 While this step is in the process of being done, melt your white chocolate in a double boiler. 
 Make sure all the chocolate is nice and smooth. 
 (if it needs to be smoothed out, add a tablespoon of Crisco shortening) drop one ball at a time into the chocolate and using a large fork drop the ball in the chocolate and take out and place on a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper. 
 Continue this until all balls have been dipped. 
 Drizzle some milk chocolate or colored chocolate over the balls for a pretty effect. 
 You can do this by adding melted chocolate into a corner of a zip-lock bag and cut off a tiny corner and use this as a pastry bag. 
 Let sit until chocolate is hard and then refrigerate.
