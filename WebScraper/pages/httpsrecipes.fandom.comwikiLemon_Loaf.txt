Ingredients : 
 1¾ cup unbleached white  flour 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 large  lemon 
 ½ cup vegan  margarine , or a light, natural  oil  like sunflower 
 1 cup granulated  beet sugar  (I haven't tried this with unrefined  brown sugar , but i imagine it would be fine) 
 equivalent of 2  eggs  in  egg replacer 
 ⅔ cup unflavoured or  vanilla  flavoured  soy milk  or nut  milk 
 ½ tsp  vanilla extract 
 ¼ cup extra granulated  beet sugar  that has been powdered in your coffee grinder (to get an  icing sugar  consistency, for the glaze) 
 Directions : 
 Lightly  oil  a loaf pan. 
 Preheat your oven to 350°F. 
 Mix together the dry ingredients (except the  sugar ). 
 Finely grate the  lemon peel  (just the yellow part. The white part is bitter!) and stir into the  flour  mixture. 
 Squeeze the juice from the  lemon  and in a small bowl, mix it with the ¼ cup of powdered  beet   sugar . 
 Set aside for the glaze. 
 Beat the  margarine  or  oil  and  sugar  together in a separate, large bowl, until it looks quite creamy. 
 Add the  egg replacer  and alternate adding ½ of the  flour  mixture with ½ of  milk  mixture at a time, beating well between additions. 
 Add the  vanilla  and mix well. 
 Pour into the loaf pan and bake 50–60 minutes until it tests done (slip a toothpick into the centre and if it comes out clean, it's finished baking). 
 Let cool on the counter for ten minutes, then drizzle with the glaze. 
 Let cool another ten minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack. 
 Serve at room temperature.
