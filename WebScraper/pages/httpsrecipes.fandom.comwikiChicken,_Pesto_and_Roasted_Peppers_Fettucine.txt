What better to cook than something so fast and packed with flavor? I got this recipe from Sara
Moulton's show. Instead of pulled rotisserie I just fried chicken breast with adobo. I also omitted the olives since they're not my taste. I almost went into a panic when I thought I lost the recipe. That's how much I love it! by Chef Christine
