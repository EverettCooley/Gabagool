 Caramel , the French term for burnt sugar, is used not only as a flavoring but as a coloring in savory dishes as well as desserts. In its most basic form,
 caramel is made by melting sugar in a pan over heat, while stirring constantly until it is liquified; and then starts to change color.
 The deeper the colour the stronger will be the  distinctive taste. If cooked too long, it darkens and turns bitter.
 In the production of candies, other ingredients such as cream are added to melting sugar for a softer result.
