 1 (20oz.) can crushed  pineapple  undrained and unsweetened
1 package Instant Pistachio Pudding,  sugar  free can be used
1 (8oz.) carton  Cool Whip 
1 cup Miniature Marshmallows
1 cup  ricotta cheese 
 Stir dry pudding into whipped topping and remaining ingredients. Blend
well
without breaking  Cool Whip  down to much. Put in a mold or bowl you've
very
lightly sprayed with non-stick spray. Chill several hours or overnight
before serving. To serve put a plate over top of mold or bowl and invert
quickly. Tap mold or bowl all over with handle of a table knife and lift
gently up, hopefully the salad will be in one piece when your through.
This
is a very good tasting salad.
 You could use any flavor of instant pudding you wish. Depending on how
well
your crowd likes the salad, it should feed about 10 servings.
