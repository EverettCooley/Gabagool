A small to medium sized squash ranging in diameter from 5 to 7 inches. Round and hard skinned, the inner flesh has a mellow taste similar to sweet potatoes. The squash can be baked, pureed, or steamed to be served as a side dish seasoned with butter and herbs, or used as a base for soups and stews. When preparing in an oven, the squash can be cooked whole or cut in half lengthwise from the stem to the bottom. Place the squash with the skin side down in a dish containing ½ inch of water. Cover the dish and bake for ½ to ¾ hour at 375°F. In a microwave, cook for approximately 20 minutes in a dish with a loose cover of plastic wrap. This squash is available year round, but best during August to October.
