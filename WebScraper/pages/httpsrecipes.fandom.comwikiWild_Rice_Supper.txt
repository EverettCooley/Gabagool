and place bowl with rice on rack in cooker. Cover bowl tightly with
foil. Use a foil sling, as needed, for easy removal of bowl. Lock
lid and bring to full pressure. Adjust heat, maintaining pressure,
and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from heat; release pressure
naturally. Remove bowl, rack, and drain remaining water.
 Heat cooker and brown sausage; drain. Add celery and onion to
sausage and saute until tender. Stir in remaining ingredients
including rice. Lock lid and just bring the pressure up to the point
where steam is escaping. Let pressure drop by itself.
