Description : 
       Not actual product, just a photo of kebabs.     
 Modeled after the Middle Eastern dish  kofta  and designed for cooking on skewers in a clamshell grill or  George Foreman Grill  this recipe makes a savory combination of traditional ingredients with sunflower seed butter for a main dish that goes well with rice and grilled vegetables.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ground lamb  or  veal  - 1 lb / .5 kg will generously cover six 8-inch skewers 
 minced  onion 
 minced  garlic 
 ground  cumin  seeds 
 ground  coriander seeds 
 sunflower seed butter 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Combine the onion, garlic, spices, and sunflower seed butter in a bowl and mix thoroughly. 
 Add the ground lamb or veal and fold in the spice mixture. Allow to sit for several hours or overnight. 
 Roll meat mixture into finger shapes and pierce lengthwise with metal or wooden skewers. 
 Apply oil or other anti-stick agent to grill surface if necessary and turn on grill. 
 Place skewers on grill for five to ten minutes or until cooked through. 
 Notes : 
 Like most spices coriander is best if purchased as whole seeds and ground as needed. If allowed to sit in the meat mixture for this dish as instructed above all that's necessary is to crush the coriander seeds on a plate with a large spoon.
 Sunflower seed butter is available in some whole foods stores in North America. Its use in this dish is an innovation rather than a traditional ingredient. Try substituting peanut butter, walnut butter, or other seed butters also.
 Serve on a bed of rice or couscous topped with diced tomato.
