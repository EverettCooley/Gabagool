 In a small bowl, combine  oregano ,  thyme ,  paprika ,  cayenne ,  black pepper ,  sugar ,  cumin ,  salt ,  garlic powder ,  onion  powder,  Tabasco sauce , and  oil ; mix well into a paste. 
 Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil; pour a small amount of  oil  onto foil and spread with a paper towel. 
 Peel  potatoes  and slice into french fry shapes. 
 Place fries in a plastic bag with paste and work paste onto fries; alternatively you can do this in a bowl, but the bag method is easier. 
 Place fries on lined baking sheet, trying not to let edges touch. 
 Bake in preheated oven for approximately 30 – 35 minutes (your time may vary with the size fry you cut); turn once during cooking to brown underside.
