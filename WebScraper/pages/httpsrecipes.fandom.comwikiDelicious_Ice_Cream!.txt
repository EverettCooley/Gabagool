Delicious Ice Cream! 
In the world of sweet indulgences, ice cream is in a class of its own. What is a birthday party without ice cream and cake, and who hasn’t had a soft vanilla cone on a hot summer’s day! Countless favorite desserts are built around ice cream, like banana splits and hot fudge sundaes. Ice cream comes in a tremendous variety of flavors. Chocolate, strawberry and vanilla are considered the three basic flavors, and they still rate within the top ten favorite ice cream flavors, according to a 2003 study. Vanilla tops the list with first place, as always! There’s pralines and cream, triple chocolate, caramel nut, and cheesecake, and literally hundreds more! It’s no wonder choosing an ice cream flavor is such a difficult decision! 
 Ice cream may be delicious, but it also has nutritional value. Calcium plays an important role in building and maintaining strong bones, along with other vital functions. As a dairy product, ice cream is easy to eat. A favorite with young and old alike, it's a good contributor of calcium to the diet. 
 Ice cream has been with us for a very long time. Even a hundred years ago ice cream cones could be seen in abundance at carnivals. Hand cranked ice cream makers have been churning out home-made ice cream in backyards across the country for many years, and still are popular today. Ice cream makers are a little improved upon from the early days, but operate on the same principle. Whether home-made or from your favorite grocers’ freezer, ice cream is a timeless favorite.
