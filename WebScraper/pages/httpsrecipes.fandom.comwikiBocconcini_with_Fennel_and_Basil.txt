 Description : 
 Bocconcini are tiny balls of milky soft Mozzarella cheese, usually found in containers with brine. Each are hand-stretched and rolled. If you can't find bocconcini, use ordinary Mozzarella cheese cut into bite-sized pieces. Bocconcini can usually be purchased in finer Italian delicatessens, good cheese shops and in gourmet grocery stores.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  bocconcini 
 1 tsp  fennel seeds , lightly crushed 
 3 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil 
 small bunch of fresh  basil  leaves, roughly torn 
 salt  and ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Drain the bocconcini well and place in a bowl. Stir in the olive oil, fennel seeds and basil, then season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill for one hour. 
 Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and leave to stand for about 30 minutes for the cheese to return to room temperature before serving. 
 Serve as antipasti if using this dish for a full, traditional Italian meal; make sure to serve an appropriate wine along with this.
