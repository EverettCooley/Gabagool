 4 cups unflavored  yogurt 
 1¾ cups  all-purpose flour 
 ½ cup  whole wheat flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 whole  egg 
 1  egg yolk 
 ½ cup  water

 Directions : 
 Place the  yogurt  in a cheesecloth-lined strainer and let drain for 1 hour. 
 For the dough: while the  yogurt  is draining, combine the white and whole- wheat  flours and ½ teaspoon  salt  on a work surface. 
 Make a well in the center. 
 Mix together the whole  egg , yolk and  water ; pour into the well in the  flour . 
 Using a fork, gradually bring the  flour  into the well to mix together. 
 Using a pastry scraper and your hands, gather the mixture into a ball and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. 
 It will be a rough dough. 
 Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
 Sauce : 
 Pour the  chicken stock  into a saucepan and reduce over high heat to ½ cup. 
 Combine half of the stock, the drained  yogurt ,  garlic  and  olive oil . 
 Mix with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. 
 Season with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Set aside at room temperature. 
 Filling : 
 Combine the  lamb ,  onion  and  parsley ; season with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Knead together for 2 minutes; set aside. 
 Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. 
 Cover with an inverted bowl so the dough doesn't dry out. 
 Then?
