Ingredients : 
 2 large bundles of salad leaves 
 3 – 4 big  tomatoes  (or 8 – 9 small ones) 
 6  potatoes 
 1 can of  chickpeas  (“pois chiches”) 
 3  hard-boiled eggs 
 2 small tins of  tuna 
 3 big  lemons 
 3 – 4 big  onions  (6 small ones) 
 lots of  garlic 
 black pepper 
 1 tin of  anchovies  (expensive, and therefore optional) 
 Directions : 
 Canned  chickpeas  should be reconstituted in  lemon juice  first for better flavor, so you will want to soak the  peas  in the juice of the  lemons  for and hour or two prior to prep (if you don’t have time or can’t find  lemons , add  salt  generously to this salad to balance flavors). 
 Wash leaves, peel them off their stems, and drain as thoroughly as possible. 
 Sauté the  garlic  and the  onions  together in the  oil . 
 Mix together with the remaining ingredients, including some leftover  lemon juice . 
 You won’t need to add  oil  or  vinegar  because some of the  oil  from the  onions  and  tuna  inevitably gets into the salad, along with the  lemon juice  (which takes place of the  vinegar ). 
 Boiled  potatoes  are often easier to peel.
