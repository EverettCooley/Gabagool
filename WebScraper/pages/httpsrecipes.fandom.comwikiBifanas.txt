 Ingredients : 
 12 medallions of  pork loin , about ¼ inch thick 
 3 – 4 cloves of  garlic , chopped 
 1 tsp coarse  salt , 
 1 tsp  chili paste 
 3 tsp  paprika 
 2 cups of  white wine 
 olive oil  (for frying) 
 2 – 3 large  onions 
 Directions : 
 One day before you plan to serve this recipe, mash the  garlic  and  salt  to form a paste. 
 Add the  chili paste  and 1 tsp of  paprika . 
 Coat the medallions with paste and place in a shallow baking dish cover with wine, making sure coverage is complete. 
 Refrigerate overnight. 
 The following day, remove the medallions from the dish, saving the marinade. 
 Heat ½ cup of  olive oil  over a medium-high heat. 
 Add the  onions  and sauté until golden. 
 Add remaining  paprika  and cook for about 3 minutes. 
 Set aside, cover and keep warm in a large skillet pour enough  olive oil  to cover about half the bottom of the pan. 
 Heat until the pan is very hot but not smoking. 
 Brown the medallions a few at a time, being sure not to crowd them. 
 Fry for about 1 minute on each side.
