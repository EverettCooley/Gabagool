 Ingredients : 
 1 quart  mayonnaise 
 ¾ quart apple  cider vinegar 
 ½ cup  corn syrup 
 ¼ tablespoon  cayenne pepper 
 prepared  horseradish 
 lemon juice 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Place all ingredients in a very large blender or food processor (it may be necessary to do this in 2 batches; just add ½ of each ingredient and then repeat) 
 Blend for 1 minute, or until thoroughly combined and mixture is smooth. 
 Pour sauce into a large bowl. 
 Use when grilling chicken; brush lightly over the chicken during the last few minutes of grilling. 
 This sauce is also great for dipping; set some sauce aside for passing at the table.
