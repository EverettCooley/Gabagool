 salt  (optional) 
 juice from 1  lemon 
 ¼ cup dried  breadcrumbs 
 ¼ cup shredded reduced-fat  cheddar  cheese 
 3 tbsp reduced-fat  margarine

 Directions : 
 To help save on time, have your fish market remove the scaled, insides, head and tail from the fish before bringing it home to cook. 
 Heat the oven to 375°F. 
 Sprinkle salt (optional) and lemon juice on the flounder and lay in a non-stick baking pan. 
 Cover the flounder with breadcrumbs, cheese, small lumps of margarine, and onion. 
 Bake in the oven for 35 – 45 minutes or until fish flakes easily. 
 Baste the flounder from time to time to keep moist.
