 Description : 
 Boeuf aux Mangues Sauvages
 
 Ingredients : 
 salt  (to taste) 
 2-3 Lbs of  Beef , cut into large bite-sized pieces 
 1 dozen wild  mango  kernels, crushed with a mortar and pestle 
 1 cup  palm oil , or any  oil 
 2  tomatoes , peeled and chopped 
 1  Onion , finely chopped 
 1-2 tbsp dried  Shrimp 
 cayenne pepper  or red pepper (to taste) 
 Directions : 
 In a large pot bring a few cups of salted  water  to a boil. Add the meat and cook it for a few minutes. Drain and remove the meat and set it aside.
 If using whole wild  mango  kernels, heat half the  oil  in a skillet. Add the kernels. Cook on low heat, stirring often.
 Heat the remaining  oil  to the pot the meat was cooked in. Add the  tomato ,  Onion , and dried  Shrimp . Cook for a few minutes then add the meat. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for an hour. 
 While the meat-tomato- Onion  mixture is simmering, use a potato-masher to crush the wild  mango  kernels. Keep warm. 
 When the meat is fully cooked and tender, stir in the crushed kernels bit by bit. Be careful to avoid forming lumps. Continue to simmer, stirring often, for a few minutes or until the sauce reaches the desired thickness. Adjust seasoning. Serve meat and sauce with boiled  sweet potato .
