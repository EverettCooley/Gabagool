 The rice bean is a small, hairy annual vine which bears yellow flowers and small edible beans. It is a minor food and fodder crop and occasionally a weed.
 The English language name is a literal translation of the Chinese language name (Chinese: 米豆; Hanyu Pinyin: mǐdòu).
 Seed color is variable, but commonly red or yellow.
 Although a separate species from the more common  azuki bean , its appearance and uses are similar.
