Description : 
 Serves about 2 people.
 
 Ingredients : 
 About 2 – 3 cups of  gari . 
 About 4 – 6 cups of  water 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  water  to a boil. 
 Lower the heat. 
 Add the  gari  to the boiling  water . 
 Stir the mixture until it is consistent. Add more  gari  or more  water  to obtain the thickness you would like. Because  gari  is a little coarse, the resulting eba will be a little course, but if done properly, should not be lumpy.
