 Ingredients : 
 2 lb long white potatoes 
 1  egg 
 1 tablespoon  margarine 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 3 tablespoon grated  Parmesan cheese 
 6 tablespoon  all-purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 Place  potatoes  in a pressure cooker with enough  water  to cover. 
 Close pressure cooker and put in medium heat. 
 Cook for 5 minutes after the regulator starts to blow steam or until tender. 
 Peel  potatoes  and rice them using a potato ricer. 
 Place riced  potatoes  in a large bowl and refrigerated for at least 3 hours (better if refrigerated overnight). 
 Combine into the refrigerated riced  potatoes  the  egg ,  margarine ,  salt , grated  cheese  and mix well while adding the  flour  just enough to keep mixture from sticking. 
 Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rope Â¾-inch thick and cut into 1-inch long pieces. 
 Press each piece with a fork to create a pattern and slight indentation that will hold the sauce when served. 
 Boil the  gnocchi  in batches in plenty of salted  water . 
 The  gnocchi  are done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface, remove with a slotted spoon, and serve.
