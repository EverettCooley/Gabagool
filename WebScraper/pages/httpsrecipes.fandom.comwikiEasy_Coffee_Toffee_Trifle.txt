Easy Coffee Toffee Trifle
 1 1/2 T. instant coffee
1/4 cup sugar
1 Angel Food cake, about 12 oz
2 cans {12 oz. each} skim evaporated milk
1 package {5.1 oz.} instant vanilla pudding
1 carton {16 oz.} light whipped topping, thawed
1 cup English toffee candy bar, coarsely crushed
 In a large bowl, dissolve coffee and sugar in 2 T. hot water. Refrigerate until cool. 
 Meanwhile, cut or tear the cake into 1 1/2 inch chunks. 
 Pour milk and pudding into coffee mixture. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes.
 Stir in cake pieces, and set aside for 5 minutes.
 In an attractive 2 quart serving bowl, layer 1/2 the cake mixture. 
 Top with 1/2 the whipped topping, and half the toffee. Repeat with the remaining cake mixture and whipped topping. 
 Sprinkle the remaining toffee over the top. 
 Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1-2 hours so flavors will blend. 
 Trifle may be refrigerated overnight.
