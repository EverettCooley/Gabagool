 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 large  onions , finely chopped 
 2 tblsp.  oil 
 1 tsp.  cumin  seeds 
 1 tsp.  mustard seeds  (the black kind, if possible) 
 8 medium  potatoes , quartered 
 1 and 1/2 tsp.  fresh ginger , crushed 
 1 large  garlic  clove, minced and crushed 
 1 tblsp. ground  cumin 
 1 tblsp. whole coriander, crushed 
 2  chile peppers  or 1 tsp.  cayenne pepper 
 1/2 tsp.  turmeric 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 4  cinnamon  sticks 
 6 cloves 
 4 oz.  tomato  paste 
 1/2 lb.  green beans 
 1/2 of a small  Cauliflower 
 1 medium  Eggplant 
 1/2 lb. fresh  green peas , shelled, or 1 small package of frozen  green peas 
 1 bunch of fresh leafy greens ( kale ,  spinach ,  collards , etc.), or 1 small package of frozen greens 
 1/2 cup dry  Chickpeas , cooked (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. In a large, heavy skillet or pot, brown the  onions  in moderately hot  oil  along with the  cumin  seeds and  mustard seeds .
Add the  Potato  pieces (peeling is optional), and stir to coat each piece with the spices. Now add the remaining spices and continue to stir for several minutes.
Thin the  tomato  paste with about 2/3 cup of  water . Stir into the pot. Add vegetables, one at a time, cooking for a minute or so between each addition, and put in the cooked  Chickpeas  last.
If your pot is not oven proof, transfer mixture to one that is.
Cover with a lid or seal with foil and bake for about 45 minutes, checking after the first 20 minutes.
The consistency should be rather thick, but add liquid if necessary to prevent burning. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Serve over  rice  or with Indian bread.
