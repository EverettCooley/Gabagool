Ingredients : 
 Meat filling : 
 minced  beef  or  mutton 
 medium  onion 
 salt 
 ground  pepper  (optional) 
 garlic  (optional) 
 chopped herbs (optional) 
 5-spices (optional) 
 Dough : 
 premium  wheat flour 
 a pinch of  salt 
 3 lukewarm  water 
 yeast 
 Directions : 
 Dough : 
 Dissolve a pinch of  salt  and  yeast  in lukewarm  water , mix in  flour  and knead into smooth soft dough. 
 Leave the dough to rest and double in size. 
 Knead again and cut into small pieces (the size depends on whether you like small or medium mantuun buuz). 
 Roll the pieces into balls and leave them rest in a bowl. 
 Sprinkle with  flour  to avoid from sticking together. 
 Meat filling : 
 Mince  beef  or  mutton . 
 You can certainly use a Moulinex for this purpose; however, mantuun buuz will taste better if you do the mincing by hand using a sharp knife. 
 Combine the meat in a bowl with minced  onion , crushed  garlic  (optional), herbs (optional) and other seasonings. 
 Add some  water  to make the filling juicy. 
 The next stage is forming mantuun buuz. 
 Roll out the dough ball into circles by leaving the center thicker than the edges. 
 Put the meat filling in the center of the circle and start sealing the edges with your fingers. 
 With mantuun buuz, sealing is much less sophisticated because the sealing becomes almost unnoticeable when the dough rises during steaming. 
 Mantuun buuz can have a round shape with an open hole in the center or can be closed like a more roundish version of hushuur. 
 However, open mantuun buuz will become more juicy and tastier. 
 When forming is complete, put mantuun buuz in a steamer and steam for 15 â€“ 20 minutes. 
 Steamed mantuun buuz must be served hot.
