I first made this mousse when I was in college and needed to make something quick for a potluck at a friends house. I adapted it from Mollie Katzen's 1998 cookbook " Vegetable Heaven ". When I was buying the ingredients someone asked what I was making and assumed I was vegan. But you don't need to be a vegan or a tofu fanatic to enjoy this dessert. In fact, I think this dessert should really be called "I Can't Believe It's Not Dairy!".
 
 Cook Time : 10 minutes + 2 hours to chill 
 Serves : 4-6 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ to 1 cup semisweet  chocolate chips 
 1 x 10-ounce box soft,  silken tofu 
 2 large ripe  bananas , chopped 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 2 to 3 tablespoons  light brown sugar 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  raspberry vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  chocolate  in a carefully observed  microwave  at low power. 
 While the chocolate is melting, purée the tofu and a handful of banana chunks together in a  blender . 
 Gradually add the remaining banana, taking time to puree after each addition so the mixture comes out smoothly. 
 Blend in the vanilla, sugar, salt and vinegar as you go. 
 Pour the melter chocolate into the tofu-banana mixture and use a scraper to get every last bit of chocolate in. 
 Puree for a final time until the mixture is incredibly smooth and consistent. 
 Pour mousse into a container or individual serving bowls, covering tightly with saran wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours prior to serving.
