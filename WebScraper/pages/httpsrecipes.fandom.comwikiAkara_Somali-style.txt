Ingredients : 
 2 to 3 cups dried  cowpeas  ( black-eyed peas ) or similar 
 1  onion , finely chopped 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 hot  chile pepper , and/or sweet  green pepper  or  sweet red pepper 
 ½ teaspoon fresh  ginger  root, peeled and minced 
 peanut oil ,  palm oil , or  vegetable oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 Clean the  black-eyed peas  in running  water . 
 Soak them in  water  for at least a few hours or overnight. 
 After soaking them, rub them together between your hands to remove the skins. 
 Rinse to wash away the skins and any other debris. 
 Drain them in a colander. 
 Crush, grind, or mash the  black-eyed peas  into a thick paste. 
 Add enough  water  to form a smooth, thick paste of a batter that will cling to a spoon. 
 Add all other ingredients (except  oil ). 
 Some people allow the batter to stand for a few hours (overnight in the refrigerator); doing so improves the flavor. 
 Heat  oil  in a deep skillet. 
 Beat the batter with a wire whisk or wooden spoon for a few minutes. 
 Make fritters by scooping up a spoon full of batter and using another spoon to quickly push it into the hot  oil . 
 Deep fry the fritters until they are golden brown. 
 Turn them frequently while frying (if the fritters fall apart in the  oil , stir in a beaten  egg , some  cornmeal  or crushed  breadcrumbs ).
