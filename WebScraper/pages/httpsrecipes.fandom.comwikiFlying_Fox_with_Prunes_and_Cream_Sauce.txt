Ingredients : 
 6 flying foxes 
 1 pound  prunes 
 1 Â¼ cup  white wine 
 salt , 
 pepper 
 1/4 cup  flour 
 2 oz.  butter 
 1 tbsp  red currant jelly 
 1 cup thick  cream 
 Directions : 
 Remove the flesh from the flying foxes. Either plunge the animals in boiling water for a while, then skin them and remove the flesh from the bones, or roast the animals for a little over an open fire, remove, and when cool, break open down the backbone and remove the flesh from the skin. 
 Soak the prunes overnight in 1 cup of the wine, then heat for about ten minutes in the wine before using. Season the flying fox meat with salt and pepper and roll in flour. Saute in butter over a low heat until brown. Add the rest of the wine, cover and cook another 20 minutes. Add the juice from the prunes, and transfer the prunes onto a serving dish. Cook the meat in the prune juice, uncovered, for another 10 minutes, then place on the serving dish with the prunes.
