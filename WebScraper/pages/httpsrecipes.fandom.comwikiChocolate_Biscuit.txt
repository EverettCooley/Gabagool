 Chocolate Biscuit   Tasty Chocolate Biscuit 
 
 
 How I thought of this : 
 Over the last few weeks I saw a lot of amazing chocolate desserts that had me craving chocolate. Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts and I have not had one in a while. I thought that a chocolate cheesecake would be the perfect finish to my weekend steak dinner. I decided to go with a chocolate graham wafer crust and drizzle the cheesecake with a chocolate sauce for lots of chocolate goodness. The chocolate cheesecake turned out really well. It was nice and rich and creamy and decadently chocolaty. It really hit the spot. 
 How to make this: 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  graham cracker  crumbs 
 1 tablespoon  cocoa powder 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 2 tablespoons  butter  (melted) 
 3½ ounces  dark chocolate  (chopped)

 1 (8 ounce) package  cream cheese  (room temperature) 
 ¼ cup  sugar 
 1  egg  (room temperature) 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Chocolate Sauce : 
 1 ounce  dark chocolate 
 1 tablespoon  corn syrup 
 1 tablespoon  heavy cream 
 Directions : 
 Mix the graham wafer cookie crumbs, cocoa powder, sugar and butter. 
 Press the mixture into the bottom of two 4 inch spring form pans. 
 Melt the chocolate and in the heavy cream in a double boiler. 
 Mix the cream cheese and sugar. 
 Beat in the egg and vanilla extract. 
 Mix in the chocolate. 
 Pour the mixture into the spring form pans. 
 Bake in a preheated 325 °F oven until it is set, about 45-60 minutes. 
 Chocolate Sauce :
