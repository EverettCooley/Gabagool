 About Halvah : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Halvah on Wikipedia 
 Halva is used to describe a type of candy which originated in Iran, and is popular today in Western Asia and surrounding areas. The name is derived from an arabic word for a sweet confection.    There are many ways to create halva, however it typically uses either grain ground into flour (such as semolina or rice) or sesame paste as a base, although it is possible to use a root vegetable base as well.  Butter is added for depth of flavor, and it is typically sweetened with some type of sugar syrup, sweetened milk, or coconut milk.  Raisins, dates, other dried fruits and nuts are often added.
