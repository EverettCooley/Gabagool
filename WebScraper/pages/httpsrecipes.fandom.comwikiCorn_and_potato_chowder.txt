 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cup coarsely chopped  onions 
 (preferably red) 
 4 cup boiling veg. stock (or 
 more) 
 1 lbs thin-skinned  potatoes 
 peeled and cut into ½" 
 dice 
 1 large red  bell pepper , seeded and 
 diced 
 4 cup fresh or frozen (defrosted) 
 corn  kernels 
 2 tbsp fresh or ½ t dried  thyme 
 Directions : 
 Heat some stock in the cooker. Cook the  onions  over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the rest of the stock,  potatoes , red  bell pepper , 1 c of  corn , and  thyme . (she notes here that if you are using fresh  corn , add the cobs too for more sweetness). Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure ad cook for 4 minutes. (!!! i was impressed !!!) reduce the pressure with a quick-release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. Remove the  corn  cobs (if used). With a slotted spoon, put about 2 c cooked veggies into a food processor and puree them w/2 more c of the  corn . (i just dumped the 2c  corn  into the cooker and used one of those hand-held blenders right in there to puree things together until it looked nice). Stir the puree back into the soup together with the remaining c of uncooked  corn . Add  salt  and  pepper  and simmer until the just-added  corn  is tender, 2–3 minutes
