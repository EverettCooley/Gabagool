About Herring Family : 
 Herring is an oily fish of the genus Clupea, found in the shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans, including the Baltic Sea. Two species of Clupea are recognized, the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), each which may be divided into subspecies. Herrings are forage fish moving in vast schools, coming in spring to the shores of Europe and America, where they are caught, salted, smoked, marinated and creamed.
