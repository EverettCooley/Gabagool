Ingredients : 
 18 Vanilla Cupcakes 
 1 C unsalted sweet cream  butter , softened  
 2 C  powdered sugar    
 1 tsp pure  vanilla extract  
 3 tbsp  heavy whipping cream 
 1 bag mini  marshmallows 
 Instructions : 
 Empty the bag of mini marshmallows into a large bowl. 
 Use scissors to snip the top half of each marshmallow in 3 to 4 spots. Doing this will make them look like freshly popped popcorn kernels. Set the prepped marshmallows aside. 
 Using a standing mixer, combine all ingredients until stiff peaks form and the frosting is creamy.  
 Scoop the frosting into a piping bag prepared with a medium star tip. 
 Pipe frosting onto the cupcakes. 
 Begin sticking the "popcorn" onto the frosting to make it look like a mound of "popcorn". 
 Once done sticking on the popcorn, spray spots yellow to make it look like butter.
