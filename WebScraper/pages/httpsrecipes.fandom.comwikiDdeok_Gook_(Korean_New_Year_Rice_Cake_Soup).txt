This is a traditional Lunar New Year dish in Korea. I have seen many different recipes - the only really standard ingredient seems to be the  rice  cakes—but I really liked the savoriness of this one. The  rice  cakes in this soup are not the crispy American kind, but a firm Asian kind used in soups and other dishes. They are like Korean mochi, if that means anything to you. You could use  beef broth  instead of the anchovy broth if you prefer, although I don't think the anchovy broth really tastes fishy - it's more  savory , in the way that  worcestershire sauce  and Caesar  salad dressing , both of which contain anchovy, are  savory . Be careful eating the  rice  cake: it is so slippery it almost slides down your throat, but gooey enough that you really need to chew it. This is from koreankitchen.com, but I had to do a really specific search to find it, so I thought I'd post it to give it wider exposure, because it was good, and a new treat for me.

 2 servings Change size or US/metric 
 50 minutes 10 mins prep 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup thin sliced Korean  rice cakes  (ddeok gook ddeok) 
 ¼ cup dried  anchovies  (myeol chi - I think the Japanese word is naboshi) 
 6 cups  water 
 2  green onions , chopped 
 4 ounces  beef , cut into thin strips 
 1  egg , beaten 
 2 sheets  nori  (seasoned kim, dried  laver  seaweed) 
 ¼ teaspoon  soy sauce 
 ¼ teaspoon  sesame oil 
 ⅛ teaspoon  sugar 
 ⅛ teaspoon  pepper 
 ⅛ teaspoon minced  garlic 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  rice  cake in cold  water  for 30 minutes. 
 Marinate the  beef  in the soy sauce,  sesame oil ,  pepper ,  sugar , and minced  garlic . 
 Saute the  beef  in a skillet, then set aside. 
 Put the 6 cups of  water  and the dried  anchovies  in a pot. 
 Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. 
 Strain out the  anchovies  and return the broth to the pot. 
 Add the  rice  cakes to the broth. 
 Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium. 
 Cook for 10–15 minutes, until tender. 
 Add the  green onions . 
 Pour the  egg  in a little at a time. 
 Let it set a bit, then stir- if you stir right after adding the  egg , the broth gets milky. 
 Put into bowls. 
 Garnish each bowl with some  beef  and some crumbled kim.
