 Ingredients : 
 2 cups cooked fresh  salmon 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 Â½ cup soft  breadcrumbs 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 3  eggs 
 Directions : 
 Remove the skin and bones from the  salmon , chop the meat fine, and add  salt ,  white pepper  or  paprika , soft  breadcrumbs ,  lemon juice  or  vinegar , and well beaten  eggs . 
 Mix thoroughly, and pack in six or eight oiled cups, filing the cups even full. 
 Set the cups at once in a pan containing hot  water  that comes to about an inch below their tops, and bake for one-half hour. 
 If the oven is very hot, lay a sheet of thick paper over the cups. 
 Turn out upon a hot platter, thrust a sprig of  parsley  or  celery , or a clove, into the center of each puff, and pour about them any good sauce.
