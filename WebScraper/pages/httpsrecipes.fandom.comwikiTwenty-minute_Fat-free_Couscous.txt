 1 each  couscous  prepared per pk (1½ cups  water  to 1 cup  couscous ) 
 ½ cup cooking  sherry 
 1  onion , chopped 
 2 cup chopped  broccoli  and/or  cauliflower 
 1  bell pepper , chopped 
 1 bunch  green onions 
 1 bunch  spinach 
 garlic  to taste 
 1 herbs ( rosemary ,  oregano ,  bay leaves ) 
 1 small pinch  cayenne pepper 
 2 tbsp  whole wheat flour 
 Directions : 
 Place a large skillet over medium heat. 
 Pour about ½ – ¾ cup of cooking  sherry  in. 
 Chop up 1  onion  and add. 
 Stir occasionally. 
 Add a couple cups of chopped broccoli and / or cauliflower. 
 Continue to sauté. 
 Add a chopped  bell pepper . 
 Add a bunch of  green onions , spinach, , etc. 
 Can be added at this point. 
 Add as much  garlic  as you can stand. I usually use 3 or 4 cloves. 
 Add rosemary,  oregano ,  bay leaves , and small pinch of cayenne. 
 Sauté all of this until done. Usually just a few minutes. 
 Add  water  to couscous, stir well, and leave covered. 
 Remove most of the vegetable from the skillet, leaving as much liquid as possible, and some of the vegetables. 
 Add 2 cups of room temperature  water  to the remaining liquid. 
 Mix two tablespoons of  whole wheat flour  in ½ cup of room temperature  water  until completely dissolved. 
 Any lumps will prove disastrous. 
 When the  water  in the skillet boils, and the  water  / whole wheat mixture. 
 Stir until the gravy thickens.
