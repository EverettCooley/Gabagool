Ingredients : 
 1 bunch  broccoli   or  1 lb frozen chopped  broccoli 
 6 cloves  garlic 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 2 tbsp  water 
 ¼ tsp  cayenne pepper  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Wash  broccoli  and cut into small florets. Cut the tender parts of the stem into smallish cubes or save for  Broccoli Stem Pickled Pennies  or  Broccoli Cole Slaw . 
 Steam in a microwave steamer or over boiling  water  until barely tender and still bright green (about 3-1/2 to 5 minutes in a microwave, depending on the volume of  broccoli  and  water ). Don't overcook: with all cruciferae, this is a very important guideline! 
 Place  olive oil  in a skillet over medium heat. Chop or mince the  garlic . 
 When the  oil  is hot, add the  salt , then the  garlic . 
 Sauté, stirring frequently, just until the  garlic  starts to soften. 
 Quickly add the  water , and the  cayenne  if desired. Turn heat low and simmer for a couple of minutes. 
 Place the  broccoli  in a large glass or crockery serving bowl. 
 Pour the  garlic  mixture over it, mixing gently to coat. 
 Serve and enjoy. Leftovers are delicious cold, added to salads.
