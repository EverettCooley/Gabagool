 Squirrels are often hunted and cooked after traditional recipes by the Native Americans. Also meat dishes are made with Guinea pig meat, Bison, Guanaco and Turkey. In some parts of the United States poultry meat and fish are highly consumed. In order to be served meat is most of the time steamed, grilled or made like stews.
