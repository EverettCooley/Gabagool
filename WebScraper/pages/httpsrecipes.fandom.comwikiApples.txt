 The native home of the apple is not definitely known, but the tree originated probably in the area between the Caspian and the Black seas. Charred remains of apples have been found in the prehistoric lake dwellings of Switzerland. Evidence shows that man has been enjoying apples for at least 750,000 years. Apples were a favorite fruit of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Today, Americans eat about 120 apples apiece each year. At least 50% of the domestic crop is used in items we use every day such as, applesauce, juice, jellies, and other popular desserts. (Wellness Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition, 1992).
