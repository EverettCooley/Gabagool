Description : 
 It is not sloppy wet like so many others out there. However, this recipe can be served wet too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 lbs  chicken  legs or  chicken wings  (tips removed) 
 2 (6 ounce) bottles Bruce's  hot sauce  (or your favorite brand) 
 ½ cup  unsalted butter , melted 
 ⅓ cup  Italian salad dressing , not creamy 
 2 teaspoons  lemon juice 
 2 teaspoons dried  basil  leaves 
 Directions : 
 Broil  chicken  until done and is a nice golden crispy brown. 
 Mix up sauce while  chicken  is cooking. 
 Once  chicken  is done, dip each piece of  chicken  into sauce and return to broiler. 
 Allow sauce to become a bit dry being careful not to burn. 
 Dip each piece of  chicken  in sauce again and put under broiler one more time making sure to put opposite side up. 
 Eat with  chicken  flavored noodles and a veggie for a complete meal, or do as we do and pig out without anything else. 
 Enjoy!.
