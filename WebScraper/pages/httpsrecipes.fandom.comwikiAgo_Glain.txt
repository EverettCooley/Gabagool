 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 6 live (1-pound ea) crabs 
 1 cup  vinegar 
 salt 
 freshly ground  black pepper  to taste 
 3 large  tomatoes 
 1  bay leaf 
 1 sprig  parsley 
 3 large  onions 
 2 whole cloves 
 3  limes , juiced 
 1 tablespoon  dende oil 
 1 teaspoon Pili Pili 
 Directions : 
 Wash the crabs and place them live in a large stockpot full of boiling  water  to which the  vinegar ,  salt , and  pepper  have been added. 
 Cook the crabs for 10 minutes, skimming off any residue that rises to the top of the  water . T 
 hen add the whole  tomatoes , the  bay leaf ,  parsley , and one of the  onions  with the cloves stuck in it.
 
 Remove the  tomatoes  after 5 minutes and continue to cook the rest of the ingredients for an additional 5 minutes or until the crabs are done. 
 Remove the crabs. (You may wish to reserve the  water  in which the crabs have been cooked to use for cooking the  white rice  that traditionally accompanies this dish.) 
 Remove the crabmeat from the body and the claws, trying to maintain the shells for serving. 
 Place the crabmeat in the  lime juice . 
 Meanwhile, heat the  oil  in a saucepan. 
 Mince the two remaining  onions  and brown them lightly in the  oil . 
 Add the cooked  tomatoes  and cook the mixture until it is reduced to a pastelike consistency. 
 When the mixture is reduced, add the Pili Pili, stir to ensure that the flavors are mixed, verify flavoring, and serve hot. 
 The crabs are traditionally served in their own shells or in ceramic shells, on a bed of  rice  covered with the sauce. 
 Alternately, the sauce may be served separately in a sauceboat.
