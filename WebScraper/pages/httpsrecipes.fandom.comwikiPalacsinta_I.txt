Description : 
 Hungarian pancakes
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 whole  eggs 
 2 cups  milk  (may substitute  club soda  for up to ½ cup of the milk) 
 2 tsp  sugar 
 2 cups sifted  flour 
 butter 
 Directions : 
 Mix  flour ,  salt  and  sugar . 
 Combine well beaten  eggs  and  milk . 
 Add  egg  and  milk  gradually to  flour  mixture, beating to a thin smooth batter. 
 Let batter sit for at least ½ hour, up to overnight. 
 This gets rid of the raw  flour  taste and permits the flour to hydrate. 
 Spoon 3 tbsp on hot buttered skillet. Will be very thin. 
 Tilt skillet quickly in a circular motion to distribute batter over skillet. 
 Brown lightly on both sides. 
 Continue this until batter is used up. 
 As each crêpe is done, spread with  strawberry  jam, roll up lightly and sprinkle with  powdered sugar . 
 These can be made ahead of time and reheated in a slow oven for a few minutes.
