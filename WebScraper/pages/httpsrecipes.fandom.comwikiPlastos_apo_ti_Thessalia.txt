 Plastos from Thessalia. For those who can't handle spreading a pastry sheet
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ kg  corn flour 
 1 kg of  spinach 
 ½ kg of  leeks 
 butter 
 oil 
 200 g ground  hard cheese 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 We wash the  spinach , then finely cut it. 
 We cut the  leeks  in round pieces. 
 We mix  leeks  and  spinach , pour  salt  in them and mix and them put aside. 
 Ten minutes later, we squeeze them until their juices are removed. 
 In the meantime, we pour the  flour  in a pot, add some  salt  and  water , and create a mush. 
 We add the  cheese  and stir well. 
 We  butter  a baking pan and spread half of our  mush  on the bottom of it, with a spoon. 
 We spread the vegetables on top of the mixture. 
 We smear with  olive oil  and spread the rest of the  mush  on top of that, making sure the vegetables are properly covered. 
 We pour  olive oil  on the surface and bake at 200°C, until it gets a rosy colour. 
 We serve it hot. 
 It goes great with  yoghurt .
