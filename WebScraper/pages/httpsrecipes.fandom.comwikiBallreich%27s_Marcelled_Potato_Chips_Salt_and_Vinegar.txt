 Description : 
 Ballreich's   Marcelled Salt and Vinegar Potato Chips  are wavy, rippled chips. Ballreich's chips are described as being "marcelled" because the waves resemble those of the marcelled hair fashion in the 1920s, shortly after Ballreich's was founded.
 
 Reviews : 
 According to reviewers at  taquitos.net  the chips lack crunch and seem to dissolve in your mouth after you bite into them. Taquitos tasters felt that the salt and vinegar taste was okay, but not good enough to entice them into finishing the entire bag of chips.
