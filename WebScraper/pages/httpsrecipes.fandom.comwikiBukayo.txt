Description : 
       Bukayo     
 Bukayo  is just one of the products made from buko (young coconut). It is an after-dinner treat that Filipino children love. It is made by simmering coco meat strips in coconut water mixed with white or brown sugar (which explains the white or brown color).  The result is a sweet tasting diabetes-triggering delight. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  coconuts 
 1 kg  brown sugar 
 all-purpose flour  or  cornstarch 
 pandan leaves  and/or 2 Tbsp  Vanilla extract  for flavoring (optional) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Boil together the coconut water, pandan leaves and sugar until sugar dissolves completely and mixture thickens. 
 Remove the pandan leaves (if using) and add the vanilla extract. 
 Grate the coconut meat and cook in a pan with a little oil until it turns slightly brown. 
 Add syrup and thicken with a little flour or cornstarch diluted in equal parts water 
 Keep stirring so that syrup coats the coconut completely, mixture thickens and bukayo gets cooked completely. 
 When cooked, transfer bukayo to a bowl. 
 Form into small balls while hot. 
 Use plastic wrap or wax paper to cushion your hands from the hot bukayo.
