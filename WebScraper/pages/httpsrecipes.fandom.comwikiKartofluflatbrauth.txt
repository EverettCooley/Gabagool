 Potato  Flatbread (Kartofluflatbrauth)
 
       Kartofluflatbrauth     
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb Cooked  potatoes 
 1/2 lb  rye flour 
 Directions : 
 Peel and mash  potatoes . When cool, knead  rye flour  into them. How much  rye flour  you have to add depends on how soft the  potatoes  are, but knead until the dough does not stick to your hands. With your hands make round balls, about the size of a tennis ball, flatten with a rolling pin until fairly thin, and prick with a fork. Bake on both sides on a hot cast-iron pan, using low flame. Pile up and cover with a damp cloth to keep soft. Serve warm or cold with  butter  and  Cheese  and cold cuts. Makes 6 or more round flat breads.
