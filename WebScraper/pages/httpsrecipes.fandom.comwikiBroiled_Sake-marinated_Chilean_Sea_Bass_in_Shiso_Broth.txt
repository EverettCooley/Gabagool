 Description : 
         
 This recipe yields 2 servings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup  soy sauce 
 6½ tbsp  mirin   [1] 
 ¼ cup  sake   [2]  or dry  sherry 
 6 tbsp + 1½ teaspoons  sugar 
 1 tsp grated fresh  ginger 
 1 tsp minced  garlic 
 2¼ lb  Chilean sea bass  or  cod  fillet, cut into 6 pieces 
 3 oz medium-width dried  rice noodles 
 2 tbsp  sesame seeds 
 2 cup  chicken stock , or canned low-sodium  chicken broth 
 2½ tbsp  rice wine vinegar  or  white wine vinegar 
 1½ tsp Asian  sesame oil 
 
 Directions : 
 In a shallow glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine ½ cup of the soy sauce, 4 tablespoons of the  mirin , the  sake , 6 tablespoons of the  sugar , ¾ teaspoon of the  ginger  and ¾ teaspoon of the  garlic . 
 Add the fillets and arrange them so that they are completely covered with the marinade. 
 Let the Chilean sea bass marinate in the refrigerator for about 6 hours. 
 Heat the broiler. 
 Drain the and discard the marinade. 
 Put the fish on a baking sheet and broil until the is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.  [3] 
 Meanwhile, in a medium pot, combine the remaining ¼ cup soy sauce, 2½ tablespoons  mirin , 1½ teaspoons  sugar , ¼ teaspoon  ginger , ¼ teaspoon  garlic , the  chicken stock ,  rice wine vinegar  and  sesame oil . 
 Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Sweet  sherry , while not as sweet as  mirin , can be used in its place. 
 
 ↑   A dry  gewürztraminer  or  riesling  from the Napa Valley or Alsace has almost the same balance of sweetness and acidity as the  sake , and complements the  ginger  and  shiso . 
 
 ↑   Chilean sea bass has a very different texture from that of other fish. Even when it is cooked to well-done, the remains soft. Since it doesn't firm up, you'll need to check its temperature to tell whether it's done. Stab a small bamboo stick into the middle of the fillet. Leave for a moment, pull it out and touch the end. If it's hot, the is ready.
