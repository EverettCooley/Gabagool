Ingredients : 
 1½ oz  melon liqueur 
 1½ oz  Chambord 
 Directions : 
 This is a layered shot, for best effect use a tall thin liquer glass. 
 Pour half shot Chambord first, then slowly pour half shot  Midori ® over the back of a spoon into glass. 
 If done correctly, you should have a layered red and green shot perfect for celebration, if not-a muddy brown mess. 
 Serve in: Shot Glass
