 Notes : 
 Gulden's was founded over one hundred and thirty years ago, producing as many as thirty different types of  mustard  from its original plant on Elizabeth Street, near New York City's South Street Seaport. There ships brought in the  mustard seed ,  vinegar  and other spices (they're secret, don't ask), that contribute to Gulden's quality. Today there are three Gulden's Mustards. Golden Yellow, Hot Diablo And Spicy Brown, and the family owned business has been sold to a national conglomerate, but the quality remains high and the  mustard  remains an essential ingredients, particularly when it comes to a summertime batch of this picnic  potato  salad.
