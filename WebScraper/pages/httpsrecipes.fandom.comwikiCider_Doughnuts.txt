 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  apple cider 
 3 1/2 cups  flour 
 2 teaspoons  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1/8 teaspoon  nutmeg 
 4 tablespoons  butter  (or soy  margarine ) 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2  eggs  (or 1/2 cup  egg  replacer) 
 1/2 cup  buttermilk  (or  soy yogurt ) 
 1/2 can of  vegetable shortening  (for frying) 
 small bowl of  cinnamon sugar  (to roll doughnuts in after frying) 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan, reduce the  Cider  to 1/4 cup by simmering on medium-low heat for 20â€“30 minutes, stirring occasionally. During the last 5 minutes turn the heat up if necessary so it becomes syrupy but watch it constantly so it doesn't burn or reduce too much. 
 While the  Cider  is reducing, combine the  flour ,  baking powder ,  baking soda ,  cinnamon ,  salt , and  nutmeg . In a separte bowl, cream the  sugar  and butter. Add  eggs , then buttermilk (or  yogurt ). 
 Add egg/yogurt mix to dry ingredients along with reduced  Cider  and combine until doughy. Roll out on floured surface and cut into doughnut shapes. (I like to cut them into squares because they're easier to fry, it's quicker, and it doesn't waste any dough). 
 Put the  shortening  in a high sided pan (a soup pot works well) and heat it until liquid and about 350 degrees (it will just be starting to bubble and there should be no smoke). Put a small scrap of doughnut in to test. Fry 3-4 doughnuts at a time, about a minute per side. They should be golden brown on the outside. Crack the first one open to make sure they're done on the inside and not doughy; you may have to adjust your heat. 
 Drain doughnuts on paper towels and when they are cool enough to touch roll them in the  cinnamon sugar .
