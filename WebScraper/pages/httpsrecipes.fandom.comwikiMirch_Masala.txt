      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Pepper Sabji. "Mirch" is a Punjabi term (and Hindi I think) for  pepper  - or  capsicum . More accurately it refers to entire family of capsaicin-carrying vegetables - which includes green chillies, red chillies,  peppers  etc. (Capsaicin is the chemical that causes the "heat" sensation in chillies.) Of course, the  green peppers  (capsicums) that you get at your local grocer or supermarket are not at all "hot" - but impart a very unique taste and aroma that when cooked (with some  Potato ) will result in a fantastic tasting dish. The cooking style is " masala " - and is one of my absolutely favourite mid-week vegetarian dishes.
 I cooked this last night whilst dancing away in the kitchen to Toni Braxton's "Unbreak my heart" track - the "club mix" - a perfect song to cook (and sing) along to whilst cooking this  green pepper  sabzi!
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 6 medium/large  green peppers 
 1 or 2  onions  - very coarsely chopped 
 3 or 4 small/medium-sized  potatoes 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 2 teaspoon haldi ( turmeric ) 
 2 teaspoons  garam masala 
 2 teaspoons  ground coriander 
 Chunks of  garlic ,  ginger  and  chile 
 Pinch of  cumin  seed and pinch of  onion seed 
 A few generous dashes of  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 You might be put off slightly by the number of  peppers  used in this recipe - but don't be - because the volume might look overhelming when you end up with a mountain of chopped  pepper  - but trust me - the volume will reduce to less than half of what you start with! Because of the starting volume - you might want to get your biggest pot or karahi ready too.
 The more observant of you will notice that there is a picture of tinned  tomato  above - but I haven't listed it in the ingredients. This is because I mistakenly got the  tomato  tin prepared when I was getting the ingredients together. This recipe does *not* require  tomato !
 OK - here goes!
 Pour a couple of tablespoons of  vegetable oil  (we use  sunflower oil  because it's zero cholesterol) into the karahi - and light up a fierce flame. You want the  oil  very hot. Throw in the pinches of  cumin  seed and  Onion  seed - and wait until they start to splutter in the hot  oil  before you throw in the coarsely chopped  Onion . When I say coarsely - I mean really coarse - e.g. take a peeled  Onion , chop it in half, chop each half in half again - and then chop the quarters into half again - with this final chop in the opposite direction the previous one. I hope you get what I mean by that.
 
       Splutter some cumin and onion seeds in 2 tbsp of veg oil     
         Add the coarsely chopped onions and fry until soft     
 Fry the  onions  for a few minutes (stirring infrequently) until they are becoming translucent. Then lower the flame a bit to medium and throw in the pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie. (Remember that if you are using chunks from your freezer you must defrost the chunks first by zapping them in the microwave for about 20 seconds on full power.) Stir fry the mixture for a couple of minutes - and then add all the ground spices as per the quantities listed above - but be happy to add more or less depending upon your taste. You can use red chillie powder instead of pulped frozen chillie. But whatever you do - do NOT use powdered chillie or  garlic  as substitutes for the real thing!
 
         Then add the garlic, ginger and chillie pulps     
         Then add the ground spices     
 Stir up the spices for a minute - and then add the  Potato  chunks. The chunks should be bite-sized - and about the same sort of size/square as the  green pepper  chunks. For this dish I always use "new"  potatoes  - as they will cook quicker - and have a great texture. You could always use the small  new potatoes  of you like - and leave them with skin on - either whole or chopped into halves.
 Stir up all the  Potato  chunks so that they are coated thoroughly with all the spice/ Onion  mixture. And turn up the flame temporarily so that the karahi gets real hot and starts to make a sizzling noise. And now for the magical bit: pour in 5 or 6 shakes of the concentrated  lemon juice  into the pot - which will make it sizzle even louder! The  lemon juice  provides a little extra liquid with which to steam the  potatoes  in. 
 
 
         Then add the patatos chunks     
         Stir it all about     
 After adding the dashes of  lemon juice  - stir it all up - reduce the flame to low - and stick the lid on the pot - with no vents. The objective is to steam the  potatoes  gently until they are soft. But be careful not to overcook the  potatoes  so that they are mushing or breaking up. The  new potatoes  I used only took 15 minutes to soften to the point that they are almost ready to eat. It's at this point that you add all of the  green pepper  chunks - increase the flame again - and stir it about - until the  peppers  are also coated in the spices. Leave the flame high as you put the lid back on - and let the  peppers  heat up until the pot is making the loudest noise that it can before you reduce the flame to very low.
 
         Steam with lid on pot for around 15 minutes     
         Then add the green pepper chunks     
 Keep it on the very lowest flame you possibly can for a further 30 to 30 minutes. Stir after 10 or fiften minutes. You will notice that the  peppers  have reduced in volume dramatically - and the pot has a lot more liquid in it. What you should do is cook for the final 10 minutes with the lid off so that some of the  water  evaporates - and what you are left with is a semi-dry consistency (see large picture below) - i.e. nothing should be "swimming" in  water . At this point you are ready to serve!
 
         Put lid on and let steam on very low heat around 30 minutes     
         When the peppers have softened and released their water serve up!
