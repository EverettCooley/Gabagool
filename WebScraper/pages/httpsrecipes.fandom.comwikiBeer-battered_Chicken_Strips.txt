Description : 
 This bold, countrified poultry dish is made and packed with real beer, flour, and baking soda and cooked to great, golden perfection. Serve up a red-hot, crispy treat with other side dishes so when it comes to beer and fried chicken, make the chicken strips crispier and tastier with other herbs and spices.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1-  2 large  eggs 
 ¾ -1 ¾ cup  beer , any brand, cold only 
 1 - 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 1 - 2 teaspoons  baking soda 
 1 - 3 teaspoons  salt 
 ground  black pepper 
 3 - 6  chicken breast  halves, skinless, then boneless 
 1 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  egg  lightly with a whisk. 
 Beat out or mix up the  beer , then the dry ingredients, whisking until smooth. 
 Cover and let stand for 25 to 30 minutes before using. Cut  chicken  breasts in half lengthwise. 
 Heat  oil  in a 10-inch skillet over a moderate-high heat until  oil  reaches the desired temperature of 360° F (or use the deep-fryer). 
 Using tongs to hold  chicken  strips, dip into the batter; allow the excess to drip off. 
 Remove and carefully lower, one by one, into the hot  oil . After about 1 minute, just turn the strips. 
 Continue to turn the strips occasionally until they are golden, cooking for a total of 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel lined tray. 
 Pat more towels on top to absorb excess  oil . Serve immediately with barbecue sauce or sweet and sour sauce, as well as over rice.
