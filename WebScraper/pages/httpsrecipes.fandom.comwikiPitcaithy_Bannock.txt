Description : 
 Bannock is an ancient and traditional bread of the Scots and early Canadian settlers. In Scotland, many towns and villages have their own unique recipes for it, and this is one of my personal favourites. Although many bannocks are in the bread family, this one is more closely related to shortbread cookies. It can be served as dessert, at afternoon tea or "happy hour", and stops that slight grumbling in your belly when you need a bedtime snack. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 lb  unsalted butter 
 2 	ounces caster or  superfine sugar 
 2 	ounces  confectioners' sugar 
 200g  all-purpose  flour 	(1-1/2 cups, less 4 tsp) 
 100g  rice flour (2/3 c) 
 2 	ounces  slivered almonds 
 2 	ounces citrus peels 
 Directions : 
 Cream the butter and sugars together 
 Add both the flours and mix well. 
 Add almost all the almonds, work them in and roll out into 1 large round or 2 smaller rounds 
 Press in the remaining  almonds  and citrus peel and decorate the edge by pinching with the finger and thumb. 
 Mark into slices and prick the top all over lightly with a fork. 
 On a lightly greased cookie sheet, bake at 300 °F for 60 minutes or until just golden brown. 
 Dust with caster sugar and divide into slices while still warm.
