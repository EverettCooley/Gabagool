 Wikipedia Article  About Anisette on Wikipedia 
 Anisette is an Italian anise-flavored liqueur mainly consumed in France and Spain. It is sweeter than most anise-flavored liqueurs (such as pastis), and also has a lower alcohol content (typically 25% by volume, versus 40%). Marie Brizard is the most well-known brand of anisette.
