 Cook Time : 10 minutes prep, 4–6 hours baking 
 Serves : 8 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups  apples , cored and chopped 
 1 cup  raspberries 
 2 tablespoons frozen  orange juice  concentrate 
 2 tablespoons  honey 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 1 teaspoon fresh  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 140 °F. 
 Using a blender, blend 1 cup of apples, the raspberries and the orange juice concentrate until smooth. 
 Add remaining apples and blend until smooth. 
 Pour apple mixture in a medium sized bowl then stir in the honey, cinnamon and lemon juice. 
 Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap and tape to edges. 
 Do not use wax paper or aluminum foil since it's difficult to remove the fruit from these items. 
 Pour apple mixture on the plastic lined baking sheet and spread with a rubber spatula until it's ⅛ inch thick. 
 Leave about ½ inch of space open from edge of pan to allow fruit to expand while drying. 
 Bake in oven for 4–6 hours. 
 Fruit leather is done when it is no longer sticky to the touch. 
 When done, roll the fruit with the plastic wrap the long way. 
 Cut into 2-inch pieces. 
 Store pieces in an airtight container.
