Make these cute Panda rice balls!
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 Rice 
 Seaweed (nori) 
 Fillings of your choice 
 Salt 
 Directions : 
 1.　Cut out a panda face from the seaweed using a Panda Onigiri seaweed stamp (or print a stencil online and use that to cut out the face).
 2. For the hands, stack on 2 sheets of nori to make 2 rectangles, at a size of about 1 cm × 3 cm and round off to 1 side.
 3. Make a small barrel shaped onigiri. You can tuck in your favorite fillings! Or simply season it with salt.
 4. Assemble the parts. You can add a mouth or change the facial expression if you like! Placing umeboshi (salt-cured ume plums) on the cheeks are cute too.
 5. Stick on the hand shaped nori at a slant and they will turn out very nice.
