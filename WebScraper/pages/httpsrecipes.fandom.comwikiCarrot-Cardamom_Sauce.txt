Ingredients : 
 6 cups fresh  carrot juice 
 1 teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 5 tablespoons  cornstarch  mixed with 6 tablespoons  vegetable stock 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  carrot juice  and  cardamom  in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes (the  carrot juice  will separate; this is okay). 
 Mix in the  cornstarch  mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. 
 Pour the sauce into a blender and process to incorporate the  carrot juice . 
 Use the sauce immediately, or cool quickly by setting in a bowl of  ice  and  water . 
 Store in an airtight container for up to one week in the refrigerator or freeze for about one month.
