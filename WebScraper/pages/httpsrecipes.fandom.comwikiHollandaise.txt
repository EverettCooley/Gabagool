About Hollandaise sauce : 
 Hollandaise sauce is an emulsion of  egg yolk  and  butter , usually seasoned with  lemon juice ,  salt , and a little  white pepper  or  cayenne pepper . In appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy. The flavor is rich and buttery, with a mild tang added by the seasonings, yet not so strong as to overpower mildly-flavored foods.
 Hollandaise is one of the five sauces in the French haute cuisine mother sauce repertoire. It is so named because it was believed to have mimicked a Dutch sauce for the state visit to France of the King of the Netherlands. Hollandaise sauce is well known as a key ingredient of  Eggs Benedict , and is often paired with vegetables such as steamed  asparagus .
