 Ingredients : 
 4 graham cracker squares, finely crushed 
 2 pounds  firm tofu , pressed and very well drained 
 1/2 cup honey 
 1 teaspoon  almond extract 
 2/3 cup  granulated sugar 
 2 tablespoons soy  oil 
 1/4 cup  lemon juice

 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
 Spray a 9-inch pie pan with  vegetable oil spray  and coat it lightly with the graham cracker crumbs, tilting pan to spread the crumbs.
 In a food processor or blender (a food processor makes the job easier), blend all the remaining ingredients. Process until very smooth, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Pour into the prepared pie pan.
 Bake at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour, until small cracks start to form. Cool at room temperature about 20 minutes, then refrigerate.
