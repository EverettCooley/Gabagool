 Description : 
 Flat pieces of mutton cut from the ribs and fried till they acquire a crisp crackling texture.

 Directions : 
 Take the entire rib section and cut into rectangular pieces across the ribs. 
 Care should be taken that the muscle covering the ribs is not removed. 
 Each piece of the rib should be about five inches in length and two inches in width, containing about three to four pieces of rib bone in the meat.
