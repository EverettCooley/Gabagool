       Chambord Liqueur     
 About Chambord Liqueur : 
 Chambord Black Raspberry Liqueur  is inspired by a raspberry liqueur produced in the Loire Valley of France during the late 17th Century. The liqueur was said to have been introduced to Louis XIV during one of his visits to the Ch√¢teau de Chambord. It was common during that time for liqueurs and cognacs to be consumed with elegant meals.
 Chambord is made from  raspberries ,  blackberries , Madagascar  vanilla , Moroccan citrus peel,  honey  and  cognac  to create an all-natural Black Raspberry liqueur.
