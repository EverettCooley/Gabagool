 Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds fresh  tuna  steak 
 2 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 2 inches fresh  ginger  root, minced or grated 
 3 tablespoons  tamari  dark soy sauce 
 2  scallions , chopped 
 ½ small  red bell pepper , finely chopped 
 2 teaspoons  sesame oil  -- eyeball the amount 
 2 teaspoons grill seasoning blend (recommened: Montreal steak seasoning by McCormick)  or  1 teaspoon black pepper and ½ teaspoon coarse salt -- eyeball it 
 1 tablespoon light-in-color oil, such as  canola ,  safflower  or  peanut oil 
 ½ pound  shiitake mushrooms , coarsely chopped 
 coarse salt 
 4 sesame  kaiser rolls , split 
 1 jar, 8 ounces,  mango chutney 
 4 leaves  red leaf lettuce 
 1 jar, 8 ounces,  wasabi  mustard (recommended: Stonewall Kitchen brand) -- Asian sweet-hot mustard, available on the condiment aisle as well as in Asian foods section of larger markets, may be substituted 
 exotic root vegetable chips (recommended: Terra brand), to pass at table, optional 
 pickled ginger , optional plate garnish 
 Directions : 
 Preheat a nonstick griddle or a grill pan to high heat. 
 Cube tuna into bite size pieces and place in a food processor. 
 Pulse the processor to coarse-grind the tuna; it should take on the consistency of ground beef or turkey. 
 Transfer tuna to a bowl. 
 Combine ground tuna with garlic, ginger, dark soy sauce, scallions, red bell pepper, sesame oil, seasoning blend and black pepper. 
 Form 4 large patties, 1½ inches thick. 
 Drizzle patties on both sides with light-in-color oil, such as canola, safflower or peanut oil. 
 Cook tuna burgers 3 minutes on each side for rare, up to 6 minutes each side for well done. 
 Preheat broiler. 
 In a medium nonstick skillet over high heat, saute fresh shiitakes for 2 or 3 minutes in 1 tablespoon light oil -- 1 turn of the pan in a slow stream. 
 Season mushrooms with salt and pepper. 
 Open up the rolls and lightly toast them under the broiler. 
 Spread mango chutney on the bottom of each bun. 
 Top with tuna burger, shiitakes, red leaf lettuce. 
 Spread wasabi mustard or sweet hot mustard on bun tops and set them in place. 
 Serve with exotic chips and pickled ginger, if desired.
