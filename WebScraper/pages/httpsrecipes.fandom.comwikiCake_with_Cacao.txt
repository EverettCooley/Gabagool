 14 oz / 400 g  flour

 Directions : 
 Cream the  butter  with the  sugar  and  vanilla , add the  yolks  one by one.

 Take 4 - 5 tablespoons of this mixture and put in a bowl where you mix this with 1 tablespoon cacao. 
 Place half of the plain (without cacao) mixture in the buttered and dusted bread pan, then pour the cacao mixture down the middle over the plain mixture (to obtain a brown strip in the middle, from one end to the other). 
 Then pour the remaining plain mixture. Bake, first at low temperature, then somewhat higher. 
 When done, remove onto a wooden cutting board and cover with a cloth.
