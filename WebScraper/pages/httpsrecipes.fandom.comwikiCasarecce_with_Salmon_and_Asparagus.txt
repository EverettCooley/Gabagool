 Description : 
 Since the secret really is in the sauce, skipping meat altogether won't make this recipe any less appetizing.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ pound cooked  salmon  or  arctic char  (poached, roasted, grilled, pan-seared, smoked--your choice) 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1 small  yellow onion , thinly sliced 
 1 small bunch thin  asparagus , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 5  eggs , beaten 
 2 tablespoons  milk  or  cream 
 ¼ cup freshly grated  Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 1 pound  casarecce  pasta 
 coarse  salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Flake the fish with a fork or your fingers and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. 
 Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sweat them for about 2 minutes, until they begin to soften. Add the asparagus and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, until the asparagus is just tender. 
 Whisk the eggs, milk and cheese together in a large mixing bowl. Set the bowl next to the sink to access immediately after draining the pasta. 
 Drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook to al dente. Drain, shake firmly 2 or 3 times to eliminate excess water, and immediately transfer to the mixing bowl with the egg mixture. Toss constantly for 30 seconds or so, coating all of the pasta with the sauce as it thickens. Add the asparagus and onions and toss to combine. Gently fold in the flakes of fish. 
 Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve with additional Parmigiano-Reggiano, to taste.
