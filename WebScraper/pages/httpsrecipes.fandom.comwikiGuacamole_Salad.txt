Guacamole Salad
 3 ripe avocados
2 T. lime juice
Garlic salt to taste
1 ripe tomato, finely chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 t. salsa
2 T. mayonnaise
1 t. chili powder
 Slice avocados in half, reserving seeds. Scoop pout pulp, mash with a fork and sprinkle with lime juice and garlic salt. Fold in remaining ingredients and serve at once. Tip: If not serving guacamole immediately, press avocado seeds back into the mixture, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Seeds will help preserve color and freshness for another 2 to 3 hours.
Makes 6 servings.
