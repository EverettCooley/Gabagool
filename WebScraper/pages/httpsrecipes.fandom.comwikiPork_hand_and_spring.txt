About Pork hand and spring : 
 This large economical pork joint is cut from below the pig’s shoulder to include the lower shoulder (the hand) and jowl and runs down the fore leg to give the knuckle.
 It includes three or four bones of the belly too. On a pig bred for bacon, this cut is known as the fore hock – and can be cut into three smaller joints – the butt, fore slipper and small hock.
