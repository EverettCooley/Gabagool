 Special Equipment for Swiss Cooking : 
 Swiss cuisine relies on standard pots, pans and cooking implements.  For cooking a classic fondue, you will need special equipment such as fondue-pans, spatulas, fondue flamers to keep the fondue warm while it is eaten.  Chopsticks are essential for dipping food in the fondue.  There are also fondue platters designed for the meat and the special dipping sauces. 
 Deep fryers, or deep frying pans, are a must to cook Swiss schn√§tzls.
