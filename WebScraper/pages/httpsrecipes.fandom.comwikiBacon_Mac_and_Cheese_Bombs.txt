Description : 
 An extraordinary, divine combination of real bacon, macaroni, and cheese is made and packed with pizza dough, herbs, and ranch dressing and baked to an incredible crisp. The effort and quality are worth it but aioli occasionally replaces the ranch dressing and works for this, too.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 cooking spray 
 4 tablespoons grated cheese (Mozzarella, Colby, American, Brie, Parmesan, or Provolone), optional 
 2 cups homemade, cooked macaroni and cheese 
 8 slices fully cooked  bacon , heated and chopped 
 1 package refrigerated pizza dough  or  (1 tube biscuit dough) 
 1 ¾ cup butter, melted 
 1 teaspoon parsley flakes 
 1 teaspoon garlic powder 
 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning, optional 
 1 cup ranch dressing, optional 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 425° F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray; set aside. 
 Stir together cheese (optional), Italian seasoning (optional), macaroni-and-cheese, and bacon in a medium bowl; set aside. 
 Unroll pizza dough; press into a 15x9 rectangle. Cut into 24 square pieces. 
 Divide macaroni and cheese mixture evenly and place in the center of each piece. 
 Pull edges of each piece of dough up and around the macaroni-and-cheese mixture to enclose completely, pinching seams to seal. Place seam-side down in a pie plate. 
 Brush tops of dough with butter. Sprinkle evenly with parsley flakes and garlic powder. 
 Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Serve hot and plain with the ranch dressing, if desired.
