 Although most Ukrainian restaurants donâ€™t have a special vegetarian menu, you will notice that most of them are very happy to shape a particular dish to suit your demands. Although there is no traditional Ukrainian vegetarian cuisine the modern Ukrainian cuisine is often adjusted to fit lacto-ovo-vegetarian demands. Although meat plays an important role in most Ukrainian dishes, it is possible to find excellent Ukrainian vegetarian cooking. Soups can be adjusted to fit vegetarian standards and some of the traditional meat dishes were adapted to this eating style. Mushroom stews and meshed potatoes are among the most common Ukrainian vegetarian dishes. Salads are, of course, suited for a vegetarian regime, and you will find excellent vegetable assortments, such as salads containing radishes, green lettuce, tomatoes and carrots.
