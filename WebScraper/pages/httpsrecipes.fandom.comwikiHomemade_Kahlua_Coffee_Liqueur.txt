 1½ cups  granulated sugar 
 1½ tablespoons instant  coffee 
 2 cups 80 proof  vodka 
 1½ tablespoons  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Combine  water ,  sugar , and  coffee  in a covered saucepan over high heat. 
 Bring mixture to a boil, and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Be sure mixture does not boil over. 
 Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes. 
 Add  vodka  and  vanilla . Stir. 
 Store in any empty 750 ml.  Liquor  bottle with a screw top or another bottle with a resealable lid. 
 Tidbits : 
 It is very important that you use a covered saucepan when making this drink. 
 The alcohol will boil away if the solution is not covered when it gets hot. 
 Also the longer this drink is bottled and stored in a dark, cool place, the better it will taste. 
 For the best flavor, store it for at least thirty days before drinking. 
 Probably the hardest part of making this simple recipe is not drinking the stuff before it matures!
