 If you don"t have a thermometer, test the syrup by letting some drop from a spoon into a cup of cold  water . 
 The syrup is done when it forms a thread as it drops into the  water .

 Cool and break into chunks with a wooden spoon. 
 Stored in an airtight container, mixture will keep well for 4 th6 weeks.
