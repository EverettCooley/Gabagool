 Wikipedia Article  About Brandy on Wikipedia 
 Brandy (short for brandywine, from Dutch brandewijn—fire wine) is a general term for distilled wine, usually 40–60% ethyl alcohol by volume. In addition to wine, this spirit can also be made from grape pomace or fermented fruit juice. Unless specified otherwise, brandy is made from grape wine. It is normally consumed as an after-dinner drink.
 "Claret is the liquor for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy." – Samuel Johnson
