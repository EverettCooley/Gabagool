Description : 
 Modified from "Prairie Fire Reddened Rice", p.115 of  Coyote's Pantry  by Mark Miller and Mark Kiffin. The major differences are that I replaced the butter with  water  for the sauté, I like to toast the  rice , and ⅓ cup (even 3 tbsp) of  chile powder  is way too mouth-blistering with the "New Mexico"  chile powder  I got at the local Mexican grocery.
 
 Total time: about 45 minutes | 30 minutes unattended 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups white  long-grain rice  — try  texmati , they say 
 2 cloves  garlic /peeled and minced 
 ½  onion , peeled and minced 
 4½ cups  water 
 1 tbsp dried  oregano 
 1 tbsp  cumin 
 1 tbsp minced fresh  marjoram  leaves (i never have these) 
 2 scant tbsp medium-hot pure  chile powder  this may still be pretty hot 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 In a large pan or skillet over low heat, sauté 2 cloves  garlic  and  onion  in a tablespoon or so of  water , until soft and beginning to dry. 
 Add  rice  and increase heat to medium-high; dry-toast until golden brown, stirring frequently. 
 Add  water  and all remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, and cook for two minutes. 
 Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the  water  has just evaporated. 
 Remove from heat and let stand five minutes. 
 Fluff up with a wooden spoon. 
 Yum yum.
