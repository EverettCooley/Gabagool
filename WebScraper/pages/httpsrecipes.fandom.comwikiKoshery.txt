 2 cups of a small pasta such as  ditalini 
 ½ cup of uncooked  brown lentil 
 1 can  chickpeas 
 1 can of pasta  or   tomato sauce

 6 – 8 cloves  garlic  to taste 
 red pepper powder 
 vinegar  to taste 
 salt  to taste 
 ¼ cup of cooking  oil 
 2 tsp extra virgin  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 In a medium sauce pan heat cooking oil and add diced onions. 
 Cook them until they are almost burnt and very crispy. 
 Remove the onion and place on a paper towel to drain excess oil. 
 Save left over oil for the rice. 
 Cook rice as directed on package and add the oil you used to cook the onion to the rice water and set aside. 
 Cook pasta as directed and set aside. 
 Cook lentils until tender and set aside, remember to add a dash of salt to taste. 
 While your rice lentils and pasta are cooking make your sauce. 
 Peel and dice garlic cloves. 
 In a medium sauce pan heat olive oil then add garlic sate' until brown and there is a nice nutty smell. 
 Add the tomato or pasta sauce ( i like to use ragu pasta sauce ). 
 Once the sauce is hot add rep pepper to taste and vinegar i use a ¼ to a half cup of vinegar traditional Koshery has ½ cup if i have friends over that are new to Egyptian food i cut it down a bit, this is where your taste comes into play. Add salt to taste. 
 Warm chick peas in microwave or on the stove and drain water. 
 On a large serving dish spoon rice out flat, next do the same with the pasta, then the lentils and chick peas pour sauce over every thing and top with onions. 
 Enjoy.
