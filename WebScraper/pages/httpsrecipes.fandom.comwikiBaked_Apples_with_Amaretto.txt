I have more cookbooks... but many do not have recipes on page 17. It's usually some part of an intro to the cookbook. Here is a Page 17 recipe:
 For a really special presentation, roast these apples in individual apple bakers, small ceramic dishes made expressly for that purpose.

 Ingredients : 
 8 baking  apples , such as Jonathan, JonaGold, Ida Red, Fuji, and Cortland, cored 
 vegetable oil  for greasing pan 
 about 1½ cups  dark brown sugar 
 about ⅓ cup  amaretto  liqueur 
 lightly sweetened  whipped cream  or vanilla  ice cream  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Place the apples in a lightly oiled baking pan just large enough to hold them in a single layer. 
 If necessary, trim the bottoms so the apples stand upright. 
 Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar in the center and on the top of each apple. 
 Drizzle 1 or 2 teaspoons of amaretto in the center and over each apple. 
 Bake until the apples are very tender and the sugar has melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the apples. 
 To serve, place the hot apples in individual bowls and top with some liquid from the pan. 
 If desired, serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
