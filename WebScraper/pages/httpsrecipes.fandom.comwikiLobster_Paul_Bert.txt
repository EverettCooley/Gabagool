 Directions : 
 Take the lobsters and plunge them into boiling water into which has been added a bunch of parsley, sliced onions, salt, pepper and vinegar; let them boil steadily twenty minutes, then remove; detach the bodies from the tails; take the meat out whole from the latter in breaking the inside of the shell only; then wash and dry the shells. 
 Cut up the tail meat into transversal slices; put four ounces of butter into a sautoire, arrange the lobster escalops on top, and sauté them, adding a small finely chopped up shallot, shrimps, and walnuts. 
 Drain off the butter and replace it by a reduced  béchamel sauce  thickened with  egg yolks ,  cream  and fresh  butter , with  lemon juice  and chopped parsley, being careful to have the sauce quite thick. 
 Fill the lobster shells with this preparation, dress them crown-shaped on a bed of parsley, and arrange a bunch of parsley leaves on top. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   should there be no fresh walnuts procurable, take dry ones and soak them for twelve hours in salt and water, then peel.
