 Description : 
 Purchased from McDonald Estate in Wylie, Texas in 1990. Date and source unknown. These are a mainstay at my house. I make them almost weekly.
 
 Ingredients : 
 10 hard boiled  eggs , chopped 
 ¾ cup  Mayonnaise  (I now use the new Chipotle  Mayonnaise  or  Wasabi   Mayonnaise ) 
 1/3 cup  dill  pickle relish 
 1 teaspoon spicy  mustard 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 ½ teaspoon  cayenne pepper  (can omit if you don't want them spicy) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients together and mix well. 
 Chill for at least two hours and serve on a bed of  lettuce  or I have been known to spread them on crackers.
