Only a few steps are required for boning and butterflying a leg of lamb, which makes it a relatively easy task for the home cook, though most butchers will do this for customers who are not contented with attempting this at home. The boned leg should be placed with the fat side down. To prepare a butterfly lamb leg is essential using a sharp knife, cut into the cavity, formed by the removal of the bones. Do not cut all the way through the meat. Excess fat and connective tissue must be trimmed. Increase out the leg as flat as possible and cut into the thickest areas, but do not cut all the way through the meat. This will result in the boned shoulder becoming flatter, with a more uniform thickness throughout. Skewers can be inserted through the meat to help keep it flat, resulting in meat that is more evenly cooked but especially when griddling. Lamb shoulder whole contains the sirloin section with hip bone and the shank portion with round bone. The exterior is roofed with fell. It is usually prepared by roasting.
