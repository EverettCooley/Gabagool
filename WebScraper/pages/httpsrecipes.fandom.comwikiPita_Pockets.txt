 Description : 
 Makes 8.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For the pita bread 
 1 cup  whole wheat flour 
 1 teaspoon (5 grams)  fresh yeast , crumbled 
 1 teaspoon  Sugar 
 1 tablespoon  oil 
 1/ teaspoon  salt 
 -- For the dressing: 
 3 tablespoons fresh curds 
 2 spring  onions , chopped 
 1  garlic  clove, chopped 
 1/4 teaspoon  cumin  seeds powder 
 1/2 green  chilli , chopped 
 salt  to taste 
 -- Other ingredients: 
 2  tomatoes , thinly sliced 
 1 cup  lettuce , shredded 
 Directions : 
 For the pita bread : Combine all the ingredients except the  oil  in a bowl and knead into a soft dough using enough  water  until it is smooth and elastic. Add the  oil  and knead again. Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and allow till it doubles in volume (approx. 15 to 20 minutes). Press the dough lightly to remove the air. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll out each portion into a circle of 5" diameter with 1/8" thickness. Cook the pita breads on a griddle on each side for a minute or until the bread puffs up. Remove and keep aside. Cut each pita bread into 2 halves. 
 For the dressing : Blend all the ingredients in a food processor to get a smooth sauce. Keep aside. Warm the pitta bread halves on a griddle. Fill each pita bread half with the  tomato  and  lettuce  and a tablespoon of the dressing on top. Repeat for the remaining pita bread halves and other ingredients to make 3 more Pita Pockets. Serve immediately. 
 Tips: 1. You can also serve the pita pockets with the red  garlic  chutney. 2. Use any other patties or cutlets of your choice for filling the pita pocket. 3. You can use 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 grams) of  dry yeast  instead of the  fresh yeast  for the above recipe.
