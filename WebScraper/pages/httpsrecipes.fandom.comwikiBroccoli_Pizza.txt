 Instructions
 
 Pre-heat oven to 425° F. (If you’re using a pizza stone, place it in the oven now) 
 Place the thawed frozen broccoli rice in a large microwave safe bowl and microwave on high for 3-5 minutes or line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the cauliflower out in a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes, rotating the pan and stirring in between. Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes. 
 In a large bowl, add the cooked riced broccoli, mozarella cheese, egg, almond flour and optional seasonings. Mix and using your hands to knead well until a dough forms. 
 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the dough on top. Place another piece of parchment paper on top and using your hands or a rolling pin, press down to form a crust to about 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch thickness, creating a raised wall around the edges. 
 Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and spread marinara sauce evenly on top of the crust. 
 Sprinkle with grated mozzarella followed by desired toppings. 
 Place the pan back in the oven and cook until the cheese melts. Slice and serve hot. 
 1/3 cup grated mozzarella 
 ¼ cup sugar-free marinara sauce (Rao's) or passata sauce 
 6-8 slices pepperoni 
 1/4 cup sliced mushrooms 
 3-4 leaves fresh basil or spinach 
 2-3 chopped olives
