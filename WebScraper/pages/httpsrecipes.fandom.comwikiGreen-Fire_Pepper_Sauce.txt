 Yield: About 3 cups 
 Ingredients : 
 9 – 12 small  fresh hot green peppers , any shape 
 3 cups distilled  white vinegar 
 small  dried hot red peppers , optional 
 Directions : 
 Rinse and dry  peppers . 
 Protecting hands with rubber gloves, stem  peppers  and chop, veins, seeds and all into med-coarse pieces. 
 Place  peppers  in clean, dry heat-proof qt jar with snug lid. 
 Heat  vinegar  to simmering in saucepan; pour over  peppers . 
 Cool  peppers  and  vinegar , uncovered; then cap jar with enamel-lined canning lid or use a recycled lid over 2 layers of plastic wrap. 
 Let mixture stand at least 2 wk or as long as 3 mon, shaking jar occasionally. 
 When you think it might be ready, taste liquid cautiously! it?s a good idea to sample it on a bit of bland food, rather than directly. 
 If it?s fiery enough to suit; strain through very fine meshed sieve, pressing lightly on debris of  peppers  to extract all possible flavor. 
 Bottle sauce in clean, dry bottles or jars and cap airtight. 
 Optionally, place a single whole dried  hot pepper  in each bottle or tie 1-2  hot peppers  to neck of each bottle to indicate heat quotient of contents.
