 Description : 
 Nigerian cookies
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 cups  flour 
 2 cups  butter / margarine 
 3  eggs 
 1½ teaspoons  baking powder 
 1 cup of  water 
 1 cup of  milk  (or additional cup of  water ) 
 10 tablespoons of  Sugar 
 Directions : 
 Mix all the ingredients together. 
 Mix and/or knead the dough until it is smooth. 
 Place some powder on a cutting board or other flat surface. 
 Place some dough on the cutting board and flatten it until it is about ½ inch thick (1¼ cm) 
 Cut the dough into little squares, each square about ½ inch by ½ inch (1¼ cm by 1¼ cm). 
 Place some  oil  on the stove on medium heat, and allow the  oil  to heat up. 
 Once the  oil  is hot, place a few handfuls of the cut pieces into the  oil . (the  oil  may appear to foam...that is all right though rotating with a utensil will tame it a bit). 
 Allow the chin-chin to deep fry until brown. Some people prefer it light brown, and others dark brown. 
 Place the fried pieces on a napkin to soak up the extra  oil .
