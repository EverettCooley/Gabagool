Description : 
 This is from Betty Crocker's New Cookbook. Although I am exercising "portion control" by listing the original recommended servings, I have to confess that the four of us finished the entire recipe last time. I am being generous on prep/cook time. If you are somewhat skilled, it should take you less time than that. 6-30-04 Recipe ingredients updated to include  Onion .
