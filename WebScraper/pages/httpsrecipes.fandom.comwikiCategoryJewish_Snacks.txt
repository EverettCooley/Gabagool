 The variety of Jewish snacks ranges from doughnuts to casseroles, cookies and complex meals. The tzimmes are the traditional Jewish casseroles, which are sweet dishes made of fruit, meat and vegetables and flavored with cinnamon and honey. The sufganiyah is a doughnut in the shape of a ball, with a jelly filling and a sugar topping.
