Description 
 Got a hot pressure cooker used for stews? This basic, international main dish is made, mixed, and packed with real lamb, beef broth, herbs, and vegetables, and has a higher hint of black pepper. Sweet potatoes sometimes work for this, too.

 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 1 pound leg of  lamb , cut into ¾-inch cubes, seasoned liberally with salt and pepper   
 3 cups  beef broth , hot or lukewarm only
