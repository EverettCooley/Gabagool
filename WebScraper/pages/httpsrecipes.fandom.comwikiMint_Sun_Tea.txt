 Ingredients 
 water 
 2 bags of black tea, or mint black tea 
 1/4 cup torn mint leaves 
 slice of lemon 
 Ball or Mason jar (or any other glass jar with a lid) 
 Directions 
 Put all of the ingredients in your glass jar and fill it with water. Seal the top of your jar and place it in direct sunlight for about 6 hours. You can adjust the time depending upon how dark you like your tea. 
 When the tea looks too good not to drink, strain or remove the leaves, lemon, and tea bag. The tea can be drunk warm direct from the sun, or on ice.
