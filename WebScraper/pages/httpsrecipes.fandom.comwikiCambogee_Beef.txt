Ingredients : 
 1 pound  beef 
 Marinade : 
 2  red jalapeños  — stems removed 
 4 stalks  lemongrass  — sliced thin 
 6  lime leaves  or the peel of 1  lime 
 4 cloves  garlic 
 1 teaspoon  galangal 
 ⅛ cup  oyster sauce 
 2 tablespoons  sugar 
 1 pinch  salt 
 2 cups  water

 Mash or blend the   jalapeño ,  lemon grass ,  lime  leaves,  garlic  and  galangal  together. 
 Combine the mixture with the remaining marinade ingredients. 
 Place in a saucepan, and bring to a boil for 1 minute. 
 Remove from the heat and let cool. 
 Taste for sweetness; it should be present but not dominant. 
 Marinate the  beef  in the refrigerator for at least one hour. 
 Grill the skewers over hot coals, keeping the  beef  at least four inches from the heat lest the  sugar  burn, until desired doneness.

 Serve with  green mango  salad and steamed  rice .
