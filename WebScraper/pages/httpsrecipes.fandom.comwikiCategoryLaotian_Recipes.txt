Fish is mostly prepared as a soup, like the keng pa sai, or clear fish soup, which besides grilled fish, also includes pork bones. Rice is consumed as sticky rice or khao neeo, which is made of long grain glutinous rice. Beef is used for the beef laap, which also has Siamese version of goy. The recipe of the beef laap includes fresh ground beef, mint leaves, garlic, shallot, coriander, scallion, lime juice, fish sauce and fresh raw vegetables. Most of the Laotian desserts are based on rice (in combinations with fruits â€“ especially bananas and coconut), just like the main courses and most of the meals.
