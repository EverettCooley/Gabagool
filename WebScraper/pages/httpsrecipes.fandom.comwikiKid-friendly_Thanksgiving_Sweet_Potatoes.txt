Description : 
 This is from the  Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook  but I have used it and children like it very much. This one includes bananas but you could substitute orange juice for the bananas plus a bit of brown sugar.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 cups peeled diced  sweet potatoes 
 3 ripe  bananas 
 ¾ stick  unsalted butter 
 2 tbsp  dark rum 
 1 tbsp  brown sugar 
 ¼ tsp  nutmeg 
 salt  to taste 
 1 cup sliced  almonds 
 Directions : 
 Place the sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cook until very tender. 
 Puree the bananas and add the hot sweet potatoes, nutmeg, brown sugar, 4 tbsp of butter, and salt and process to blend. 
 Melt the remaining 2t of butter in a small skillet and brown the almonds. 
 Add almonds to the top of the purée.
