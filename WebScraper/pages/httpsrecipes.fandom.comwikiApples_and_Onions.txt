 If they do not, add a small amount of  water  just to keep them from drying up or burning. 
 When they are soft and glazed looking, add one shake of  salt , ¼ tsp  cinnamon , ½ tsp  sugar  or substitute. 
 Stir, cover and cook another five minutes. 
 Taste. 
 Add more  sugar  or  cinnamon  if you wish, but keep the taste delicate.
