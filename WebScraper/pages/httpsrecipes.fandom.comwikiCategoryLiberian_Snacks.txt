 Kanyah is a sweet vegetarian snack, made only of 3 ingredients: roasted peanuts, uncooked rice or rice flour and sugar; this meal is served immediately or stored in an air-tight container. The breads are found in a wide variety and the most representative ones are the Liberian rice bread, with cream of rice and mashed bananas, the Liberian pineapple nut bread (beaten eggs, all-purpose flour, wheat bran, dried pineapple, roasted and chopped peanuts or walnuts) or the plantain gingerbread, made with sugar, ripe plantain, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter, molasses, whipped cream and flour. Plantains are also consumed as a snack, when they are prepared fried, as chips (very green plantains, sliced very thin and fried in vegetable oil). Pumpkin is also consumed by the Liberians and as a snack; there is the traditional pumpkin cake. The recipe includes butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and the traditional spices: nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, canned pumpkin and milk.
