Description : 
 Try to get the freshest prawns you can get for this recipe. If you buy whole prawns, then you will need to remove the heads and shells, leaving the tail section intact. Serve with extra lime wedges. This is a really great and fast dish to serve at a barbecue as part of a "surf and turf" meal.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 16 giant raw shrimp or  prawns , shelled with the tail section left intact 
 1 fresh  lime , cut into 8 wedges 
 4 tbsp. sweet chili sauce/Sriracha (can be found in the aisle that holds the Asian seasonings and foods) 
 4 tbsp. chili powder, optional 
 Directions : 
 Place eight bamboo skewers in cold water and leave to soak for at least 10 minutes, then preheat the broiler to high. You can also stoke up a hot grill. 
 Thread a prawn onto each skewer, then a lime wedge, then another prawn. To brush, mix the chili powder with the sweet chili sauce, if desired. Brush the sweet chili sauce over the prawns and lime wedges. 
 Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and broil for about 2 minutes, turning them once, until cooked through. Serve immediately with more chili sauce for dipping, as well as with the white rice, if desired. 
 Notes : 
 If you are planning to serve these as a main course, then allot 4 giant prawns per person. However, since giant prawns are terribly expensive, it is a little more economical to buy frozen raw shrimp in a bag. 
 If using frozen shrimp, then try to use the biggest ones you can (16 - 20 count). Keep in mind that you will need more than 1 lime if you do this. 
 Smaller shrimp equals more food for a crowd. If you're having a small but fancy dinner party, then spend the extra money for the giant prawns; it will be worth it. 
 Serve the shrimp with an Asian-style salad or a vegetable based salad with good complementing flavors such as black beans, parsley, cilantro, etc.
