 Description : 
 Blooming Onion is an appetizer served at some restaurants. It consists of one large fried Vidalia onion which is cut to resemble a flower. The name of the dish comes from its menu name at the Outback Steakhouse ("Bloomin' Onion"), which claims to be the dish's inventor
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 giant  onion , the larger, the better 
 1 – 2  eggs , depending on the size of the onion 
 1 cup  flour , put some hot water into it, seasoned with  pepper ,  paprika ,  oregano ,  thyme  and  cumin ,  chili powder , and any spices you prefer; stir everything thoroughly 
 Directions : 
 Cut off the top of the onion, remove the skin. Cut a "X" over the onion, and turn it 90°, cut another "X". Keep doing it until you cut at least 10 – 16 times. Remember to leave the bottom intact, otherwise the flower will be destroyed. After doing this, cut the core out of the center.
