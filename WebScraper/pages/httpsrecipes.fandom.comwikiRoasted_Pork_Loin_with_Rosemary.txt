 Original recipe 
 Makes 6 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds (675 g.) boneless  pork loin  roast 
 3  garlic  cloves, peeled and mashed 
 ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml.) chopped fresh  rosemary 
 1 tablespoon (15 ml.)  olive oil 
 ¼ teaspoon (1.5 ml.)  salt , any kind 
 2 tablespoons pepper, black or red only 
 vegetable  cooking spray 
 ⅓ cup (80 ml) dry  white wine 
 rosemary  sprigs for garnish 
 Directions : 
 With a sharp knife, make slits in the pork every inch (2.5 cm) or so, at regular intervals. 
 Combine the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, pepper, and salt in a small bowl. 
 Rub the mixture over the roast and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. 
 Before you are ready to roast the pork, preheat oven to 400°F (220°C, gas mark 6). 
 Spray an oven-proof roasting pan with cooking spray and place the roast in it. Roast until an instant-reading meat thermometer registers 160° F (71° C), about 1 ¼ hour, basting once. 
 Transfer the pork to a warmed platter. Keep warm. 
 Pour off any fat in the roasting pan. 
 De-glaze the pan with wine and reduce over high heat, scraping up all the cooked bits, until the wine is reduced by ⅓. 
 To serve, cut into thin slices and spoon the wine sauce over the slices. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
