 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  maple syrup  OR 1 cup  corn syrup  (if you're poor like me) 
 1 cup nut  butter  of your choice (poor people use  Peanut ; rich use  cashew ) 
 2/3 cup 100% pure fine  cocoa powder , sifted 
 1/3 cup raw  sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the  maple syrup  and nut  butter  together, stirring constantly over low heat until well combined. Remove from heat and stir in the  cocoa powder  until well mixed. Pour into a loaf pan or similar casserole dish and press the  sesame seeds  into the top with your hands or a rubber spatula. Let set for at least 15 minutes in your fridge, then cut into small squares, and eat!.
