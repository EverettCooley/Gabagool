 Ingredients : 
 2 cups fat-free, less-sodium  chicken broth 
 5 tbsp fresh  lime juice , divided 
 1 sprig fresh  oregano 
 1½ lb peeled and deveined medium  shrimp 
 1 cup ice 
 1 cup  tomato juice 
 2 tsp Mexican-style  hot sauce 
 1 cup diced  onion 
 1 cup chopped seeded  tomato 
 1 cup chopped peeled  English cucumber 
 ½ tsp freshly ground  black pepper 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1 tbsp chopped fresh  cilantro 
 ¾ cup diced peeled  avocado 
 6  lime  wedges

 Wine note : 
 One wine has a lot to match in this bold shrimp cocktail. Lime, tomato, hot sauce, shrimp, avocado--they all impact wine differently. With so many elements at play, serve a simple, dry, refreshing white that's flexible with all sorts of seafood. One of the best is Albariño, the snappy, stylish white from Spain. Try Nora Albariño 2005 from Rias Baixas, Spain ($15). — Karen MacNeil
