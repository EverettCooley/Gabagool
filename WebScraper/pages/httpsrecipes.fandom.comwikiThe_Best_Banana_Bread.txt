Description : 
 This is great the second day and freezes great, too. If you have enough  bananas  make two and freeze one.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 large  bananas  (enough to mash 1 cup) 
 1 cup  sugar 
 replacement  for 1  egg  (can be 2  egg whites  or one  egg white  and ⅓ cup non-fat  yogurt  if you use those things) 
 4 tbsp  applesauce  (baby  applesauce  is best, but any other is fine) 
 1½ cups  flour  (i use ½ whole wheat usually) 
 1 tsp  baking soda 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 With a mixer, beat the mashed  bananas  with the  sugar . 
 Add the  egg replacer  and  applesauce  and beat again. 
 In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients. 
 Add this to the  banana  mixture and stir with a spoon until the dry stuff is all moistened. 
 Not too much stirring! pour batter into a loaf pan (about 5 x 9 inches, preferably non-stick or you can spray with Baker's Secret for a split second and spread with a paper towel). 
 Bake at 325°F (be sure to preheat first) for about 55 minutes.
