Description : 
 This is one of my favorite vegetable recipes. They go really nicely with baked fish. This is simple to make once you've mastered the browning of the butter and almonds. The trick is to remove them from the heat before you think they're really brown enough. The butter will start to take on a toasted, nutty fragrance just before the nuts are done.
