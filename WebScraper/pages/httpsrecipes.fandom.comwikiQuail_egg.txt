 Wikipedia Article  About Quail egg on Wikipedia 
 Bird eggs are a common food source. The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken, duck, and goose, but smaller eggs such as quail eggs are occasionally used as a gourmet ingredient, as are the largest bird eggs, from ostriches. The eggs of sea turtles are also sometimes used for food. Eggs are frequently used in both sweet and savoury dishes as a source of protein as well as to bind the other ingredients in a recipe together. Sometimes the egg yolk is used separately from the egg white (or albumen).
 The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalaza (from the Greek word khalaza meaning hailstone or hard lump.)
 Considered a delicacy, these small eggs are usually eaten hard-boiled or poached and in aspic.

 Fried Quail Eggs with Chorizo or Morcilla : 
 Cojonudos“Cojonudos” are another simple, but tasty “tapa” made by topping a slice of baguette with a fried quail egg and a slice of fried chorizo sausage. “Cojonudos” loosely translated means “awesome” and judging by their popularity in tapas bars Burgos, they must be! Their “sister tapa” is the “cojonuda,” made with a small slice of morcilla (blood sausage) instead of chorizo sausage.
 Quail eggs are about a third of the size of chicken eggs, are mottled grey and white. They are available by the dozen in many supermarkets in Spain and have become a very fashionable ingredient in “tapa” dishes and main courses.
