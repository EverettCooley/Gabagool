 Ingredients : 
 1 3/4 cup  unbleached flour 
 4 tbsp. cold  butter 
 2 tsp.  baking powder 
 1/2 cup fruit juice concentrate 
 1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp.  milk 
 1 tsp.  lemon zest 
 2 cups sliced  strawberries 
 4 tbsp.  strawberry jam 
 Directions : 
 Stir the flour and baking powder together. 
 Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
 Mix the fruit juice concentrate and milk together, and stir in the lemon zest. 
 Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour in the liquid and begin to mix together using a plastic dough divider or rubber spatula. The dough should come together forming a ball, yet remain fairly sticky, hence the need for the dough divider. This will make your task much simpler. 
 Knead the dough a few times in the bowl until it forms a workable ball, yet retaining most of its stickiness-you may need to work in an extra tablespoon or two of flour. 
 Pat the dough into a circle about 3/4 inch thick, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour. 
 Prepare a baking sheet by sprinkling it with a generous amount of flour. 
 Cut the dough with a serrated knife down the middle, like an english muffin, to form two circles 
 Place the bottom half of the scone dough on the baking sheet, lay the sliced strawberries evenly and place dollops of the jam to cover the bottom half. 
 Lay the top of the scone dough over this and slightly crimp the edges together. 
 You may want to carefully lift the dough at this point to check that enough  flour  has been sprinkled beneath it to prevent if from sticking while it bakes. If not, add a little extra. 
 Pre-heat the oven to 400°F. 
 Cut the dough, using the dough divider or a blunt knife, into 8 equal pie-shaped wedges. 
 Brush the top with a little milk or egg whites for a shinier appearance. 
 Bake for 14 minutes or until browned. 
 Serve when cooled just enough to handle, or store covered and re-heat in the toaster oven to crisp. 
 Yield: 8 Servings
