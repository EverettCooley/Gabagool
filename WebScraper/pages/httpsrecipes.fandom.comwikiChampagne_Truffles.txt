Description : 
 It is important to use an excellent quality  chocolate  when making  truffles  since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first choice and Callebaut is my second.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Center mixture : 
 8 oz  cream 
 1 lbs  bittersweet chocolate 
 1 oz  butter 
 1 oz  cognac 
 Enrobing : 
 1 lbs  bittersweet chocolate 
 1 lbs  cocoa 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  cream  to a boil and pour it over the cut  chocolate . 
 Allow to stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir smooth. 
 Beat in the softened  butter  and cool to set. 
 Beat with an electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if available) on medium speed until light. 
 Beat in  cognac . 
 Pipe out small truffles on parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a Â½-inch plain tube. 
 Refrigerate to set. 
 Melt the  chocolate . 
 Sift the  cocoa  into a deep pan. 
 Dip the truffles in the melted  chocolate  and then deposit them in the  cocoa , shaking the pan to cover them. 
 After the covering sets, shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess  cocoa .
