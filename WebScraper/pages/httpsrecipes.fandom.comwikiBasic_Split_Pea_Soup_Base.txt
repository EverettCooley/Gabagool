Buttery smooth. Serve as is or add croutons, carrots, potatoes, etc. The long process eliminates digestive issues and objectionable odors; and makes a tastier soup, too.

 Ingredients : 
 1 lb green split peas 
 1 lb slab bacon 
 
 
 Equipment : 
 blender 
 slow cooker 
 Process : 
 This recipe requires 72 hours of cooking time; we start on Day 0 and serve on Day 3. Time spent working is only about an hour.
 Day 0:  Rinse peas thoroughly and discard any hulls. Cover with about double the volume of cold water and soak at room temperature for 24 hours.
 Day 1:  Drain and rinse again thoroughly. Cover with fresh water and slow-cook low for 24 hours or until peas are soft, not firm, but not starting to break up.
 Day 2:  Drain and rinse as before. Run in blender, about a cup at a time. Add just enough water to keep blades from cavitating. Run at medium-high speed for a minute and return to slow cooker. Cube slab bacon and add. Do not add more water now. Slow-cook low for 24 hours.
 Day 3:  Remove from slow cooker and store. Soup base refrigerates or freezes well. To serve, add water to desired consistency. Excellent with toast.
 
 Servings : 
 6 to 8 servings.
