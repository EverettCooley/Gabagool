Ingredients
 2 c. whole-wheat flour
 1 c. nonfat refried beans
 3/4 c. water
 1/2 c. yellow cornmeal
 1/4 c. fat-free egg substitute
 3 tbsp. nonfat dry milk powder
 2 tbsp. canola oil
 1 tbsp. honey
 1 tbsp. active dry yeast
 2 tsp. chili powder
 1 1/2 tsp. salt
 2 packages (8 ounces each) nonfat cream cheese, at room temperature
 2 c. chunky fat-free salsa, drained
 1 c. shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
 Directions
 
 In a large bowl, combine the flour, beans, water, cornmeal, egg substitute, milk powder, oil, honey, yeast, chili powder, and salt. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Turn out onto a lightly floured 
 surface and knead until a soft, smooth ball forms. Transfer the dough to a clean large bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until doubled in volume. Punch down the dough and place on a floured surface. Let stand for 5 minutes. 
 Coat a 12" deep-dish pizza pan with no-stick spray. 
 Roll the dough into a 14" circle. Transfer to the prepared pan. Push the dough up the sides of the pan to form a rim. 
 Spread the bottom of the dough with the cream cheese. Top with the salsa and sprinkle with the Cheddar. Let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until puffy. 
 Preheat the oven to 475°F. 
 Bake for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep brown and the cheese is bubbling.
