 About clove lilli pilli : 
 The berry has a tart, cranberry-like flavor, that has a hint of cloves. It has been popular as a gourmet  bushfood  since the early 1980s, and is commercially cultivated on a small-scale basis.
 The fruit is most commonly used to make a distinctively flavoured jam, and is also used in sauces, syrups and confectionery. The riberry plant is also very popular as a garden ornamental and street tree. It is easily maintained as a smaller tree by light pruning.
