 Description : 
 This recipes is incredibly easy and quick to make, not to mention absolutely delicious!
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  portobello mushrooms , caps only (basically 1 – 2 caps per person) 
 2 generous slabs of Bulgarian or Greek  feta  (1 slab per mushroom cap) 
 4 sprigs of fresh  rosemary  (2 sprigs, or so per mushroom cap) 
 olive oil , a generous amount 
 Directions : 
 Bruise the rosemary sprigs 
 Marinate the feta slabs in olive oil with the rosemary springs for as long as you can stand, up to one day 
 Remove the stems from your portobello mushrooms and keep the caps (you can keep the stems, frozen, for later use in  Fridge-cleaner Vegetable Stock ) 
 Brush the caps with olive oil 
 Place a piece of feta in each mushroom cap 
 Distribute bruised rosemary sprigs (from the marinade) on each cap (2 sprigs per cap, but feel free to go nuts and add more) 
 Slather each cap in a generous amount of olive oil 
 Place the prepared mushroom caps on your hibachi (or gas-powered "man" grill) 
 Barbecue until it smells too good to resist, or the cheese is melted — feta just doesn't melt much
