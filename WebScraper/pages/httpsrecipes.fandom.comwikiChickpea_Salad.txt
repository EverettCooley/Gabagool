 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 20 oz cans  Chickpeas  or 4 
 ½ c home-cooked  Chickpeas 
 6 scallions, trimmed and 
 finely sliced 
 2 tbsp  lemon juice  [juice ofone  lemon ] 
 3/4 to 1 tsp  salt 
 1/4 tbsp finely ground  black pepper 
 2 tbsp minced Chinese (or other) 
 parsley  [i used  cilantro ] 
 1 fresh hot green  chile  (or 
 green pepper ), minced [i 
 used 2 jalapeños] 
 1/4 tbsp  cayenne pepper 
 Directions : 
 Pour contents of  Chickpea  cans or home-cooked  Chickpeas  into a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Drain, discarding liquid. [you can skip this step if you"ve just cooked your  Chickpeas ]. Now that summer"s heat is keeping our range-top and oven use to a minimum, i thought you might enjoy this salad from madhur jaffrey"s _world of the east vegetarian cooking_. It sounds spicier than it really is. In a serving bowl, combine  Chickpeas  with the other ingredients. Mix well and set aside, unrefrigerated, for 1 hour. Mix again. Serve cold or at room temperature
