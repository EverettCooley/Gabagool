 1 cup soaked  bean thread vermicelli 
 6 dried  Chinese mushrooms 
 1 small  onion , finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 1 tablespoon  soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon  fish sauce 
 1 packet frozen spring roll pastry

 1  hot red chilli , seeded and chopped 
 5 tablespoons  fish sauce 
 3 tablespoons boiling  water

 Take 2 teaspoons of the mixture and shape into a neat roll. 
 Place at one end of the pastry square and roll up, turning ends in so the filling is completely enclosed. 
 Deep fry in hot  oil  over medium heat, cooking the rolls for at least 2 minutes on each side so the filling is thoroughly cooked. 
 Drain on paper towels and serve warm, accompanied by the dipping sauce.
