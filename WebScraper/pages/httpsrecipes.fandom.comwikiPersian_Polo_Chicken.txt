Description : 
 I got this recipe from my upstairs neighbor who is Persian and always has the most wonderful smells coming out of her house
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g  basmati rice 
 1 medium  onion 
 5 tablespoons  margarine  or  oil 
 1 large roasting  chicken , jointed 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 1 tablespoon  raisins  (or more) 
 150 g  dried apricots 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon , ground 
 Directions : 
 Fry the  onion  in 3 tbsp of  margarine  or  oil  until golden, add the  chicken  pieces and brown on all sides. 
 Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper , add  raisins  and apricots, and continue to cook for a minute or two longer, turning the fruit in the fat. 
 Sprinkle with  cinnamon , cover with  water  and simmer gently, covered, until the  chicken  is very tender and the sauce reduced. 
 Bone the  chicken  if you like. 
 Wash and cook the  rice , but do not steam it. 
 It should be just partially cooked. 
 Put 2 tbsp melted  margarine  or  oil  at the bottom of a large heavy saucepan. 
 Spread half of the partly cooked  rice  over this, cover with the chicken pieces, pour the rich fruity sauce over them and cover with the remaining  rice . 
 Cover the pan with a cloth, put the lid on tightly, and steam over a very low heat for 20 to 30 minutes. 
 The cloth will capture the steam rising from the  rice  and help to make it fluffy. 
 Serve all mixed together.
