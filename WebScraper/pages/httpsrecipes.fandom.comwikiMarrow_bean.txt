 About Marrow bean : 
 Grown chiefly in the East, these are the largest and roundest of the white beans. They're usually found fresh only in the region where they're grown, but are available dried year-round in most supermarkets. Marrow beans are customarily served sauced as a side dish, in the manner of a pasta. 
 A plump looking dried bean, common in Italian cooking, that is white in color and round in shape. When cooked, this bean has a creamy, meaty texture that provides a flavor that is somewhat similar to smoked bacon. It is a bean that goes well with braised meats, soups, stews, or when served as a side dish. Great northern or navy beans can be substituted when necessary however, they do not provide that same size or flavor provided by marrow beans.
