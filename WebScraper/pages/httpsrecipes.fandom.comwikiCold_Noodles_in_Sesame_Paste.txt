 2 tablespoons honey 
 4 tablespoons  sesame oil 
 1 tablespoon  hot chili oil  (or to taste) 
 1-2 scallions 
 1-2 tablespoons  sesame seeds . 
 Directions : 
 Boil  Pasta , drain, run cold  water  over  Pasta  to cool it while in colander. Lightly toss it with some  sesame oil  to prevent sticking. Mix other ingredients and remainder of  sesame oil , preferably in blender. It should be somewhat thick, but runny enough to coat the noodles. Mix in cold  water  if it is too thick. Pour sauce over noodles, garnish with scallions and  sesame seeds .
