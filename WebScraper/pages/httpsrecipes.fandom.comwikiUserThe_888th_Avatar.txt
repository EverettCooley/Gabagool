 Hi! I'm  The 888th Avatar  (also known as  wjxhuang ), and I've been around on Wikia since November 2008. I'm an administrator on  Avatar Wiki  and previously volunteered for Wikia in 2012-2013.
 What do I do on Wikia?  I tend to involve myself in many aspects of a wiki at once: as a  wikifairy ,  wikignome  and a  wikielf . I enjoy helping out by formulating strategies to help a wiki succeed, constructing effective policies and guidelines, and tinkering with design.
 Who am I in real life?  In real life, I'm a  Chinese Australian  who is studying Arts and Law at  Monash University . I'm interested in the latest technology, world travel, liberal and international politics, and history.
