Preparation time: Slightly over 1 hour. 
 Cooking Time: Roughly 20 minutes. 
 Serves: 2 
 Ingredients : 
 4 chicken breasts, deboned, and cut into 1 inch wide strips. 
 4 tablespoons tomato ketchup. 
 1 tablespoon garlic paste. 
 1 large pinch of salt. 
 1 large pinch of crushed blackpepper. 
 1 tablespoon honey. 
 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar. (Else, use regular vinegar) 
 2 tablespoons of honey mustard. 
 1 tablespoon of olive oil. (Else, use vegetable oil) 
 1 large onion, finely chopped. 
 4 large leaves of fresh lettuce, chopped. 
 2 tablespoons of finely chopped pineapple. (For garnishing) 
 Instructions : 
 Mix all ingredients except onion, lettuce and oil. Let chicken marinate for at least one hour. 
 Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 
 Brush baking tray with olive oil. 
 Put in lettuce and onion. 
 Pour in some of the marinade, just enough to cover the vegetables. 
 Set chicken pieces on the bed of vegetables, and cover with some marinade. 
 Brush each piece with some olive oil. 
 Set in oven, and cook for 10 minutes. 
 Take out tray, turn the pieces, and cover the other side with the marinard, brush with olive oil, and cook for 10 more minutes at the same temperature. 
 Take out, sprinkle the pineapple for garnish. Optionally, add pineapple after the first 10 minutes of cooking. 
 Serving Suggestion: This goes well with whole wheat bread, red bread, wild rice and with hearty, spicy red wine, like a Shiraz. A good serving side would be steamed basmasti rice flavoured with cardamom and cinnamon.
