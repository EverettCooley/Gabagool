      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 A "biriyani" dish is  rice  with a mixture of whatever takes your fancy. In this case it's  Chicken  - and tonight I decided to use  asparagus  and  mushroom  as the main accompaniments!
 I really enjoy cooking this type of dish on a Saturday evening - as it is very convenient - and allows the person eating it to do so whilst sitting on the sofa in your living room and watching your favourite TV show or a film.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Here is a picture of the ingredients I used tonight - but feel free to vary them according to what you have in your fridge - and even substituting the  chicken  for some more vegetables if you are a veggie! It really doesn't matter what you use - as long as you like the combination of ingredients!
 
       Ingredients     
 And here is a picture of all the ingredients - chopped and prepared - and ready to go!
 
       Ingredients     
 1 medium  onion  - chopped coarsely 
 1 cup of  basmati rice  - washed until there is no starch left 
 1 medium  green pepper  - again: chopped coarsely 
 1 packet of  button mushrooms  - chopped into quarters 
 1 bunch of  asparagus  - chopped coarsely - but separate the stems from the tips (as the tips are very tender) 
 1  tomato  - deseeded and chopped finely 
 1 300g packet of  chicken  mini-fillets - chopped into coarse chunks (they cook real quick - so no need to chop too finely) [also - any cut of  chicken  will do fine - thigh is preferable - but i didn't have time to go to the High Street meat shop today - so i got a packet from the supermarket instead.) 
 1 generous chunk of frozen  garlic  pulp from your freezer 
 1 generous chunk of  ginger  pulp from your freezer (both of the above thawed by zapping for 20 seconds on full power in your microwave) 
 1 teaspoon of  salt 
 1 teaspoon of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 1 teaspoon of  garam masala 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cumin 
 2 teaspoons of  ground coriander 
 2  bay leaves  (not shown in picture!) 
 1 pinch of whole  cumin  seed (not visible in picture) 
 Directions : 
 First of all - get a large frying pan/wok/karahi (make sure it has a lid that you can see through)- heat up a couple of tablespoons of your usual  vegetable oil  in it - I use cholesterol-free  sunflower oil 
 
         Heat some oil in the karahi     
         Add some cumin seed to hot oil     
 When the  oil  is hot - add the pinch of  cumin  seeds and watch it splutter - stir it around a bit.
 Then add the chopped  onion  and chopped  green pepper  into the pan - mixing it all about - and frying until the  onion  is soft and translucent - and the  pepper  is starting to  char  a little. 
 
         Add the peppers and onions and stir fry on hot flame     
         Fry until onions browned     
 Then add the chopped  chicken  pieces - and stir it around on high heat. and then immediately add the pulped  garlic  and  ginger  - keep it stirring on fierce flame.
 
         Add chopped chicken     
         Then add garlic& ginger     
 After a few mins - throw in the chopped  asparagus  stems and  Mushrooms  - and after about a minute throw in all the ground spices as per the measures given above. Keep on stir-frying until the  mushrooms  are reduced and the  chicken  is well cooked.
 
         Add asparagus stems abd mushrooms     
         Add ground spices     
 When the  chicken  is cooked - which should only take about 5 mins - add the washed  rice  to the pot - and stir it all about - again: on high heat.
 
         Stir-fry until chicken cooked     
         Add the washed rice     
 When the  rice  has been coated in all the juices of the pan - add just less than twice the amount of  water  as there was  rice  - and then immediately stir in the tender  asparagus  tips and chopped  tomato  pieces. Make sure the flame is on max - as you want to make the  water  boil violently.
 
         Add the water     
         Add asparagus and tomato     
 Put the lid to the pan on top - and let it boil for about 1 minute - and then immediately reduce the flame to lowest possible - and set the timer on your cooker for 15 mins. keep the lid on - and DO NOT TAKE THE LID OFF AT ALL for 15 mins! (Otherwise you will ruin it!)
 
         Bring to boil on fierce flame     
         Let it steam for 15 mins     
 After 15 mins or so - switch off the flame - and then take the lid off - and fold the  rice  over a couple of times - and put the lid back on - and leave it to rest for about 15 more minutes. After that it will be ready to eat!
 
         Done     
 Serve it up with a side-salad of  onion ,  cucumber  and  tomato  - dressed in salad  vinegar  - and enjoy!
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
