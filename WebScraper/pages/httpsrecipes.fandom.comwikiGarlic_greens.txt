 About Garlic greens : 
 Garlic greens are portions of the garlic plant. The garlic cloves are made of a leaf base and the above-ground parts of the garlic plant are called garlic greens. These are sometimes consumed while they are immature and tender. The garlic greens donâ€™t have the same taste intensity and spiciness of the garlic bulb, but they are very flavored, as well. The garlic plant has these long and keeled leaves and a white-ivory bulb which contains 8 to 25 bulbs, which are the parts that are most consumed. 
 Garlic leaves are consumed fresh, like the garlic cloves, mostly chopped or minced into flakes. Garlic greens give the food a particular taste, which resembles and not to the flavor of the garlic clove. Still, the specific odor is less intense in the case of the garlic greens. Garlic greens are used for various recipes, such as soups, sauces, stews or as a seasoning for meat dishes. Cuisines like the Indian or the Tahitian ones use these garlic greens for the traditional flavors of their foods.
