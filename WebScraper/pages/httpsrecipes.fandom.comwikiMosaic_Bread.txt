 4 ounces  Swiss cheese 
 10  green olives 
 ½ picked  jalapeno pepper

 Refrigerate. 
 During this time cut the heels of the baguette and take the soft bread inside out leaving about half an inch of bread below the crust then fill with the refrigerated paste and return to refrigerator overnight. 
 Cut with a very sharp knife in thin slices about half an inch thick when ready to serve.
