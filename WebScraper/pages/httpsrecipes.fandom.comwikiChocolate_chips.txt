 Article About Chocolate chips on Wikipedia 
 Chocolate chips are small chunks of chocolate. They are often sold in a round, flat-bottomed teardrop shape (similar to a Hershey's Kiss). They are available in numerous sizes, from large to miniature, but are usually around 1 cm in diameter.
 Originally, chocolate chips were made of semi-sweet chocolate, but today, there are many flavors of chips. These include bittersweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, mint chocolate chips,  white chocolate chips , dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white and dark, swirled chocolate chips.
 Store chocolate well wrapped in a cool, dry place, for up to 4 months.
