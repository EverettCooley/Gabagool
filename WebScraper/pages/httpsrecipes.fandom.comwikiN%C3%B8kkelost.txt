 About Nøkkelost : 
 Nøkkelost cheese (or Nøkkelost, meaning "key cheese"), sometimes called kuminost, is Norwegian cheese flavored with cumin, caraway seeds and cloves. It is semi-hard, yellow, and made from cow's milk. It is made in the shape of wheels or blocks. Nøkkelost cheese is a factory made variation of Leiden cheese, and has been made since the 17th century. Its period of maturation is 3 months. It is a popular ingredient for sandwiches, casseroles, and quiches. However, Nøkkelost is expensive and somewhat rare.
