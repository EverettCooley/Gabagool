 1  onion , coarsely chopped

 2 teaspoons  curry powder 
 ⅓ cup  flour 
 16 ounces  coconut milk  or  coconut cream  (not the sweetened kind 
 1 cup cashews 
 1 red pepper chopped (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Puree the  onions ,  garlic ,  ginger ,  curry powder ,  flour  and ½ cup of the broth until smooth. 
 In a large saucepan, combine pureed mixture and all remaining ingredients except  turkey  or  chicken . 
 Cook, stirring often, till thickened. 
 Add the meat and heat gently. 
 Serve with  white rice  and small dishes of  raisins ,  peanuts ,  chutney ,  coconut ,  bacon ,  green onions , etc.
