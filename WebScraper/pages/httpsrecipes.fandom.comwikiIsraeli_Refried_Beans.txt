 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can Ful 
 1 Pickled  hot peppers  (up to 2) 
 1 tbl Juice from the pickled  hot peppers  (up to 2) 
 1 med  tomato 
 Directions : 
 I've learned to compromise with things since I've been in Israel. Since every time I want a dish of  refried beans  I don't want to take the 3â€“4 hours to make the real thing, I've found a substitute. 
 Open, rinse and drain a can of ful. Warm up on stove top. When they begin to get warm, mash them (as they cook), with a fork. They will be more dry than they are supposed to be, and I personally think they need zest, so I add both the chopped up  hot peppers  and some of their juice to add in this. 
 I have found that these are an amazingly good.
