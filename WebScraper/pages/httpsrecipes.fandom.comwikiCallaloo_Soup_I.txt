Description : 
 This is a traditional West Indian recipe, which will vary slightly from island to island.........this version is from Trinidad. Don't be put off by the look..it tastes delicious. (I don't cook with  salt , so some may need to be added for personal taste.) 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 bunch  dasheen leaves  (leaves of the  taro  plant....found in tropical Australia, optional) 
 1 bunch  silver beet 
 12 ounces  okra , cut into rounds (approx 15) 
 3 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1 whole  scotch bonnet peppers  (yellow squat looking) 
 1 bunch  spring onions , peeled and chopped 
 1 sprig  thyme , leaves only 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 500 g  crabmeat  or 6 small crabs, backs removed and cleaned and cut in ½" pieces 
 250 g streaky  bacon , cut into small pieces 
 2 – 2½ cups  chicken stock  or  vegetable stock 
 Seasoning : 
 3 – 5 drops of west Indian hot pepper sauce 
 Directions : 
 Put  oil  and  bacon  pieces in stockpot and cook  bacon  crispy. 
 Add  onion  and  garlic  and seasonings, sauté 
 Add stock,  okra , silver beet and whole pepper. 
 Bring to boil, then simmer until all vegetables are soft—approx 1 - 1½ hours — being very careful not to burst the whole pepper. 
 With spoon carefully remove  pepper  and discard. 
 Using an electric beater (or hand held swizzle stick) beat soup until vegetables are mashed down — do not purée. 
 Return pot to heat, and add crabmeat / crabs 
 Simmer until cooked. 
 Serve hot. 
 Wear a bib to keep front clean when eating crabs, and sucking crabmeat from legs — enjoy!.
