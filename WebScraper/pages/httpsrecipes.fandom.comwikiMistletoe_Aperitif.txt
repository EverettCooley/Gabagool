 Contributed by  The Bartending School 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ oz.  Chambord 
 ½ oz.  Midori ®  melon liqueur 
 ½ oz.  orange liqueur 
 Directions : 
 In a tall shot glass add Chambord, then gently pour  Midori , the second layer, over the back of an inverted spoon so that it flows on top of the Chambord without mixing. 
 Repeat the process using  orange liqueur . 
 This makes a good holiday shooter. 
 You can flambe it by igniting the top with a match. 
 Blow flame out after a few seconds and make certain the rim of the glass has cooled before drinking.
