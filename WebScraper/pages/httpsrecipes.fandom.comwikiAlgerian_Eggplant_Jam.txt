 Ingredients : 
 3 med  Eggplants  (3 lb total) 
 salt 
 7 tbsp  oil , olive 
 3  garlic  cloves; minced 
 2 tsp  paprika , sweet 
 1 1/2 tsp  pepper , Cayenne or 
 1/8 tsp Harissa 
 pepper ; freshly ground 
 3 -to 4 tbsp  lemon juice , fresh 
 1 tbsp  parsley ; chopped 
 3  lemon  wedges or 
 3  tomato  wedges 
 Directions : 
 1) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut the stems off the  Eggplants . Using a vegetable peeler or a sharp knife, peel the skin in 1/2 inch wide strips vertically down each  Eggplant  so you get a striped effect. Slice each  Eggplant  horizontally into 1/2 inch slices. Place in a colander and  salt  each slice. Let stand 30 minutes, then rinse well and pat dry with paper towels.
 2) Brush a baking sheet with 3 tablespoons of the  oil . Lightly brush the  Eggplant  slices with 2 tablespoons  oil  and place in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the slices are light golden brown on both sides.
 3) Transfer the  Eggplant  to a bowl and, using a fork or  Potato  masher, mash with the  garlic ,  paprika ,  cumin ,  water  and cayenne. Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper .
 4) Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of  oil  in a large skillet. Add the mashed  Eggplant  and fry very slowly, turned occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the moisture evaporates. Stir in the  lemon juice  and cook 1 minute longer. Taste, and season with  salt  and  pepper , if needed.
 5) Place the  Eggplant  on a platter and garnish with  parsley  and  lemon  or  tomato  wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature. This  Eggplant  spread has a jamlike consistency. 
 6) Serve it with warm country-style bread or pita.
