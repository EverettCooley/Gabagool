 Wash the  peppers  and put them in a kitchen machine or meat mincer and mince until you have a paste. Put 4-5 spoons  peanut oil  in a frying pan and ad the minced  onions  and  garlic  and bake until lightly colored, than add the  pepper  paste and the rest of the spices. and I added 3 spoons of  lemon juice  and approx. 2 full spoons of cane  Sugar .
