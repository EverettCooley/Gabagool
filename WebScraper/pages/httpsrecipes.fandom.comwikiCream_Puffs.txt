Ingredients 
 
 ½ cup  butter 
 2 tbsp. cream of tartar 
 1 cup boiling  water 
 1 cup sifted  all purpose flour 
 ¼ tsp.  salt 
 4  eggs 
 Directions 
 Melt butter in boiling water. 
 Add flour, salt, and cream of tartar all at one time. 
 Stir. 
 Cook until mixture forms a ball that doesn’t separate. 
 Remove from heat (try to give the dough "stretch" by scraping the dough across the pan as you stir). 
 Beat in eggs, one at a time, until smooth. 
 The dough should be stringy. 
 If it does not stretch when pulled, add a few drops of water. 
 Drop from a spoon on an ungreased baking sheet. 
 Bake 20 minutes in preheated 425 °F oven. 
 Let cool. 
 Cut off tops and fill with  custard  or desired filling.
