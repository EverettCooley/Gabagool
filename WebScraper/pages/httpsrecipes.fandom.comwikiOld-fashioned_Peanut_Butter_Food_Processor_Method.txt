Description 
 Peanut & Pecan Recipes  by the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, public domain government resource—original source of recipe
 
 Yield: 1 cup smooth or 1½ cups chunky peanut butter. 
 Ingredients 
 2 cups roasted  peanuts  (with or without red skins) 
 ½ tsp  salt  (omit if salted peanuts are used) 
 1 tbsp  oil 
 Directions 
 Place ingredients in food processor. 
 Using the metal blade, process ingredients continuously for 2 or 3 minutes. 
 The ground peanuts will form a ball, which will slowly disappear. 
 Stop machine. 
 Scrape the sides of the container with a rubber spatula. 
 Continue to process until the desired smoothness is obtained. 
 Notes 
 For chunky style peanut butter, stir in ½ cup chopped peanuts after the processing is complete. 
 Peanuts with red skins may be used, but  do not  confuse skins with outer shells! The resulting red flecks do not affect the flavor.
