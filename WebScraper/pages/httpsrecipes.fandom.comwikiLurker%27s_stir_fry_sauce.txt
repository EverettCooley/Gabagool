 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 x ketchup 
 x soy sauce 
 x honey 
 x  vinegar  (whatever kind you 
 feel like) 
 x  ginger  (fresh or not) 
 x  garlic  (fresh or not) 
 x  rosemary 
 x  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Usually i start with around 1/3c ketchup. The original list had  oil  in it, but i don"t think it needs it. I make the sauce separately and then dump it on near the end and only cook it down a little. I"m new to this list and to some of the concepts, so if i"ve used any evil ingredients, sorry
