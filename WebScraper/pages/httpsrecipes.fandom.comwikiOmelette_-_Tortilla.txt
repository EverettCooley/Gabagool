 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 5 extra large  potatoes  (approx 2 pounds) 
 1 large  Onion , chopped finely 
 4-5 medium sized  eggs 
 salt  to taste 
 olive oil  (Extra Virgin) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  potatoes  and slice them into medallions (extra thin slices). Dice the  Onion  finely and place aside. In a large frying pan, fill to approx ? inch full of  olive oil  and heat. Stir in the  potatoes  and  onions  until just barely covered with the  olive oil  (sealing them). Fry for five minutes, constantly stirring so as not to burn. When the  potatoes  are tender, place a plate or lid over the frying pan and drain off the excess  oil  (putting aside in a heat proof container. 
  
In a separate bowel, crack open the  eggs  and whisk, with a pinch of  salt  mixed in. Stir in the  eggs  over the  Potato  and  Onion  mix. Lower the heat so the mix doesn’t burn, and cook for approximately four minutes. Now the trick is to flip the tortilla without it going everywhere: very gently turn over the frying pan onto a plate and nudge the tortilla onto it and then flip it back into the pan to continue cooking for a few minutes (careful it doesn’t burn). When golden brown, turn off the heat and slip the tortilla onto a serving plate. This Spanish Tortilla can be served as a main course or an appetizer, and can be eaten hot or cold.
