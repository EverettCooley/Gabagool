 Ingredients : 
 15 oz. part-skim  ricotta cheese 
 1 large  egg , beaten 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 1/2 tsp. freshly ground  black pepper 
 1/2 cup finely chopped  green onions 
 1/2 cup grated Asiago or  Parmesan cheese 
 1 cup unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 Place ricotta in colander to drain. Transfer to medium bowl and add remaining ingredients except  flour . Mix well. Gradually add  flour , working it in until a soft yet firm ball is formed, about 3 minutes.
 
 Divide dough into 4 equal parts. On a generously floured surface, roll each section into a log, about 1 inch in diameter and 9 inches long. Cut logs into 1-inch segments and slightly indent each with a fork. Thoroughly cover with  flour  and store in refrigerator or freezer until ready to use.
 
 Bring large pot of lightly salted  water  to a boil. Add  gnocchi  to pot and stir gently to prevent sticking. When  gnocchi  float to top, they are cooked, about 2 to 3 minutes. (Frozen  gnocchi  will take a little longer to cook.) Drain well and serve with your favorite sauce.
