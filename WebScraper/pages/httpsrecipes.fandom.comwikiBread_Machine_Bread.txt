 Yield: 8 Servings 
 Ingredients : 
 Regular loaf : 
 1 cup  water 
 2½ cups wheat  bread flour 
 1¼ tbsp dry  milk 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1½ tbsp  butter 
 1¼ tbsp  honey 
 1 tbsp  gluten 
 2 tsp  molasses 
 1½ tsp fast-rise  yeast   or  2 tsp  active-dry yeast 
 Large loaf : 
 1½ cups plus 2 tbsp  water 
 3¾ cups  wheat   bread flour 
 2 tbsp dry  milk 
 1½ tsp  salt 
 2 tbsp  butter 
 2 tbsp  honey 
 1½ tbsp  gluten 
 1 tbsp  molasses 
 2⅛ tsp fast-rise  yeast   or  3 tsp  active-dry yeast 
 Directions : 
 The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra knead, which gives the  yeast  and gluten a second chance to create a lighter loaf. 
 When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine and start again. 
 Some manufacturers produce home bakeries with a whole  wheat  cycle; if your machine doesn't have one, this start- again method works as an easy alternative. 
 Success hints: the gluten gives the  whole wheat flour  the structure necessary for a good loaf. 
 If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food store. 
 Remember the extra knead. It's especially important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, use this recipe only on the regular bake cycle.
