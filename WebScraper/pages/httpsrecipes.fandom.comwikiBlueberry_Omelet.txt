 Ingredients : 
 2  eggs 
 2 tablespoons  water 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 ½ cup fresh  blueberries 
 Directions : 
 Mix eggs, water, salt and pepper with fork. 
 Heat butter in omelet pan over medium high heat until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. 
 Pour in egg mixture. 
 Mixture should set at edges at once. 
 With pancake turner turn over and carefully push cooked portions at edges toward center. 
 Tilt pan as necessary so uncooked eggs can flow. 
 Slide pan rapidly back and forth over heat to keep mixture in motion and sliding freely. 
 While top is still moist and creamy looking fill with warm blueberries. 
 With pancake turner fold in half or roll turning out onto plate with a quick flip of the wrist.
