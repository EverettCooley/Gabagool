Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup of  butter 
 ¼ cup of  sugar 
 1  egg 
 1½  pastry flour 
 1  egg  (for wash) 
 a little  milk 
 almonds , blanched and sliced 
 Directions : 
 First beat  butter  to a  cream ; gradually beat in  sugar , then  egg , beaten without separating the white and  yolk , and  pastry flour . 
 Cover the dough and let it remain in a cool place for one hour. 
 Break off small pieces of the dough, knead to a smooth mass, then roll under the hands to the shape of a bread stick, about as thick as a round lead pencil; bring the ends towards the middle of the dough, pressing them onto it about an inch apart, forming two rings, then set on a baking tin, one ring overlapping the other. 
 Brush with a beaten  egg , diluted with a little  milk , and press blanched-and-sliced  almonds  onto the dough. 
 Bake in a moderate oven.
