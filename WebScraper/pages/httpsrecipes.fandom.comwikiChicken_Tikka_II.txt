Ingredients : 
 1 kilo  Chicken 
 1tsp  ginger  paste 
 1tsp  garlic  paste 
 fresh dhuniya leaves (1 bunch) ( cilantro  /  coriander leaves ) 
 3-4 green chilies 
 1 medium  Onion 
 1 tsp  garam masala 
 4-5 whole dried red chilies 
 salt  according to taste 
 6 tbs  yogurt 
 OR
 
 3 tbs  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Mix all the spices together. 
 Put in a blender and make a paste. 
 Make 4-5 deep cuts on each side of the  Chicken  pieces. 
 This will help it cook better on the inside as well as giving it a better flavor. 
 Coat the pieces with the paste and leave to marinate for a few hours preferably overnight in fridge. 
 Then BBQ or bake in oven. 
 If you're going to bake it in the oven: 
 Bake it in an aluminum tray covered with foil for the first 20 minutes at 375 F. Then uncover, turn the  Chicken  over, and cover it up again. Bake for an additional 10â€“15 minutes. By this time the  Chicken  should be cooked. Now increase the temp to 450 F and uncover and bake until the top is dry and the cuts that you made have 'opened up'. Turn over and when it looks done - its done!
