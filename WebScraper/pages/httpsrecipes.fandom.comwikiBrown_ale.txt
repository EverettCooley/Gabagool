 Wikipedia Article  About Brown ale on Wikipedia 
 Brown Ale was invented at the beginning of the twentieth century in England as a bottled beer since the diffusion of bottles was increasing. It was just a sweeter version of a dark mild beer.
 Normally English brown ales are quite sweet and low in alcohol. Commercial examples include Newcastle Brown Ale and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale.
 North American brown ales trace their heritage to American home brewing adaptations of certain northern English beers. They range from deep amber to brown in color. Caramel and chocolate flavors are evident, due to the use of roasted malt. Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American varieties of hops. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.
