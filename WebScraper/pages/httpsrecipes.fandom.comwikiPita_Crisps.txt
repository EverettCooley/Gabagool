 Description : 
 The original alternative to the basic pita - this crunchy appetizer has a soft secret: pitas. But you can also dip the pita crisps with aioli, mayonnaise, ranch dressing, cheese sauce, or the like, while it then keeps a crunchy aroma cooked to perfection.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 8-inch pitas, split in half 
 cooking spray 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt , rock, kosher, or iodized only 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 350° F. Prepare pitas by cutting into 8 wedges with the kitchen knife. 
 Arrange wedges in a single layer on a baking sheet coated with  cooking spray  (or lightly greased). 
 Lightly coat pita wedges with  cooking spray  and sprinkle with  salt . Bake at 350° F for 10 minutes. 
 Serve hot and plain or with other appetizers. Dip the baked pita crisps into mayonnaise or a flavor of choice, if desired.
