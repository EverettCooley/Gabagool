 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 12 assorted  Chicken  pieces 
 1 1/2 c all purpose  flour 
 2 tbsp  chilli powder 
 2 tsp  black pepper 
 1 tbsp  cumin 
 1 whole  egg 
 2 tbsp  paprika 
 1/2 c franks hot sauce

 Directions : 
 Take and defrost  Chicken  pieces once done set aside. 
 Next combine  flour ,  chilli powder ,  black pepper ,  cumin , and  paprika  in a bowl until well blended together. 
 Next beat and  egg  in a bowl. 
 Coat the  Chicken  pieces with the  egg  on both sides really well. 
 This is our glue so to speak. 
 Pre-heat deep fryer. 
 I don't have one of those fancy monster deep fryers any one will do. 
 Take  Chicken  and roll in the combined dry ingredients. 
 Make sure you coat them very well, the more  flour  the crisper the wings will be. 
 Put in deep fryer for about 10-15 mins check every few mins depending on how high of a temp your fryer goes up to. While the wings are frying in a small frying pan simmer  butter  and hot sauce until warm. 
 When wings are done take hotsauce off the heat and pour on the wings. 
 For presentation server with  celery  and blue  Cheese  dressing. 
 Blue  Cheese  Dipping Sauce Combine 1 C. sourcream, 1 package of  cream cheese , 2 tsp  mayo , 1 Tbsp minced  garlic , 8-12 oz blue  Cheese . 
 Whipp until dressing is smooth but lumpy with blue  Cheese . 
 Refrigerate prior to serving. 
 (I like my blue  Cheese  dip really creamy you may prefer different).
