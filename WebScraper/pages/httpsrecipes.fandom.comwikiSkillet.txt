About skillet : 
 A flat-bottomed pan with shallow sides that are slightly curved. They are made of various materials, such as copper, cast-iron and aluminum, and some have a non-stick coating applied, which makes for easy cleanup. A skillet is used for frying foods over moderate to high heat so they should be thick enough to conduct heat evenly. There are several sizes available and they are generally round in shape - also known as a "frying pan."
