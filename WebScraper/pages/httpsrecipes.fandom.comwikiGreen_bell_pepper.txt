 Good-quality green bell peppers will be firm, smooth-skinned and fairly evenly-shaped. The coloring will be even with no blemishes. 
 In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, the heatless varieties are called "peppers" or "sweet peppers" (or "green peppers," "red peppers," etc.) while the hot ones are "chilli/chillies" (two L's) or "chilli peppers".
