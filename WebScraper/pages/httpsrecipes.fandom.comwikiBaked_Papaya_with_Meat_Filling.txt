Ingredients : 
 5 to 6 lbs  green papaya  cut lengthwise into halves and seeded 
 4 medium firm ripe  tomatoes , peeled, seeded and finely chopped 
 3 tbsp  vegetable oil 
 1 tsp finely chopped  chilies 
 ½ cup finely chopped  onion 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp finely chopped  garlic 
 1 lb lean  ground beef 
 4 tbsp  Parmesan cheese , freshly grated 
 ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat the  oil  over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. 
 Sauté  onions  and  garlic  until they are soft and transparent but not brown. 
 Stir in the  beef  breaking it up with a fork and cook until all traces of pink disappear. 
 Add the  tomatoes  (or substitute 1½ cups chopped, drained canned  tomatoes ), chilies,  salt  and  pepper . 
 Stirring occasionally, cook briskly until most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost solidly in the spoon. 
 Taste for seasoning. 
 Spoon the meat mixture into the  papaya  shells, spreading and smoothing the filling with a spatula. 
 Place the shells side by side in a shallow roasting pan. 
 Pour enough boiling  water  in the pan to come about 1 inch up the sides of the  papaya . 
 Bake for 1 hour then sprinkle each shell with 1 tbsp of the  cheese  and bake for 30 minutes, or until the top is delicately browned. 
 Top shells with remaining  cheese  when ready to serve.
