Description : 
 Makes about 15 - 20 biscuits.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  flour   [1] 
 2 tbsp  baking powder 
 ¾ tbsp  salt 
 ½ cup  apple sauce 
 ½ to ⅔ cup cold low-fat  buttermilk ,  skim milk  or  milk  substitute 
 Directions : 
 In a larger bowl, sift together the  flour ,  baking powder  and  salt . 
 Sprinkle the  applesauce  over the  flour , and cut in with a pastry blender until it is in bits the size of split  peas . 
 The texture should be somewhat course. 
 Sprinkle ½ cup cold  milk  over the  flour  and  applesauce , and stir it in quickly with a fork. 
 Add only as much of the  milk  as is necessary to make the dough hold together. 
 Gather the dough up into a ball, working it together with your hands very briefly, and then roll it out ½ inch thick on a floured board. 
 Cut out small rounds (about 2 ½" to 3" in diameter) and place them on a cookie sheet spritzed with PAM. If you aren't going to put them in the oven immediately, chill them in the refrigerator until ready to bake. 
 Bake the biscuits in a preheated oven at 450°F for 10 to 12 minutes, or until puffed and lightly browned on top. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Preferably, use white  pastry flour .  All-purpose flour  or whole-wheat  pastry flour  can be used, but the biscuits will be denser and less fluffy.
