 2 oz. (50 g) prosciutto 
 3 oz. (80 g)  Ham 
 3 oz. (80 g) champignons 
 2  eggs  3 oz. (80 g)

 Directions : 
 Make 8 pancakes. Cube the prosciutto and  Ham . Clean and slice champignons. Chop the  tomatoes . Press the  cottage cheese  through a sieve or run through a liquidizer. Beat the  eggs  and roughly grate the bread. Fry the prosciutto and  Ham  in a little  oil , add the champignons and sprinkle with  pepper . Take one-third of this mixture and set it aside. 
Add to the remainder the prepared  Cheese . Fill the pancakes with the filling and roll them up, closing the ends as you do with sarmas. The filled pancakes are first dipped into the beaten  eggs , covered in grated bread crumbs, and then fried in hot  oil . Now take the one-third of the mixture previously set aside, add  tomatoes  and allow to simmer. Serve this sauce with fried canelloni.
