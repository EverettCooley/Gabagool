 1 pound stew meat or round  Steak  (trimmed and cut up)

Two 10-ounce cans of cream of  Mushroom  soup
2 cups of fresh  Mushrooms  or two 4-ounce cans drained  Mushrooms

1 cup  sour cream 
Place meat,  onion soup mix , cream of  Mushroom  soup,  Mushrooms , and wine in
Dutch oven. Bake all afternoon well-covered at 200 to 250 degrees. Allow at
