 Grill corn over high heat for 5 minutes per side. 
 Let the corn cool then cut the kernels off the ears.

 Brush a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil and place it in the oven to preheat.

 Spoon the batter into the hot skillet and bake 40 minutes. 
 Loosen edges with a slender knife and invert skillet onto a round platter to unmold the corn bread. 
 Cut into wedges and serve with honey.
