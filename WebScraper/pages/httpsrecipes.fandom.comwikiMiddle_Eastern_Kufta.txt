Ingredients : 
 1½ – 2 lbs  ground beef   or   ground lamb   or   ground turkey 
 1 large  onion 
 ½ – ¾ cup finely chopped fresh  parsley 
 4 cloves  garlic 
 seasoning salt   or   salt 
 allspice 
 black pepper 
 garlic powder 
 Directions : 
 Start by chopping up your parsley in a food chopper until fine. Do not use dried  parsley . 
 Then put the parsley in a large mixing bowl. 
 Then cut  onion  up into pieces — doesn't matter how small just so you can fit it into the chopper and combine the  garlic  and chop away until fine — not pasty though. 
 Put the  onion   garlic  mixture in the bowl with the  parsley  and add ground meat and spices. 
 Mix with hands until everything is well blended. 
 Pat the meat mixture down in the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan and broil in oven until top is browned, this will enhance the flavor, then take out of the oven. 
 Peel  potatoes . 
 Slice  tomatoes  and  potatoes  into quarter of an inch in size and layer —  potatoes  first and then  tomatoes  will be top layer. 
 Sprinkle with a little salt—and bake in oven about 425 °F covered with foil for approximately 45 minutes to and hour — enjoy.
