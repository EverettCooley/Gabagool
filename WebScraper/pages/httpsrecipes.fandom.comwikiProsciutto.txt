Prosciutto, also called Prosciutto de Parma, is an Italian-style raw ham, a specialty of Parma, cured by dry-salting for one month, followed by air-drying in cool curing sheds for half a year or longer. It is usually cut into tissue-thin slices that highlight its intense flavor and deep pink color. The slices are enjoyed on their own or are heated or cooked as part of a recipe.
 Prosciutto di Parma, imported from Italy, is regarded as the best quality.
 Raw prosciutto is called  Prosciutto crudo , whereas cooked prosciutto is called  Prosciutto cotto .
