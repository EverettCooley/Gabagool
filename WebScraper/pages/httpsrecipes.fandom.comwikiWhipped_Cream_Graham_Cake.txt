Ingredients : 
 1 pint (2 cups)  heavy cream 
 2 tbsp  honey  or  sugar 
 32 squares (16 rectangles) of  graham crackers 
 sprinkles 
 Directions : 
 Beat  cream  with sweetener until stiff. 
 Spread  whipped cream  heavily on one square and place it on a platter. 
 Spread  cream  heavily on a second square and place it on top of the first. 
 Continue until there is a stack of 4 squares. 
 Press down gently on the top square so the  cream  squeezes out of the sides. 
 Spread the excess along the sides. 
 Repeat the procedure until there are eight stacks. 
 Slide them together till sides touch to form a rectangular cake of 2 squares by 4 squares. 
 Use extra  whipped cream  to smooth over all the tops. 
 Refrigerate. 
 Allowing it to chill several hours before serving enables the crackers to soften. 
 A dash of sprinkles over the top adds a party flavor with adding much additional  sugar . 
 Hint: use a pressurized can of  whipped cream  if you don"t have the time or inclination to whip the  cream .
