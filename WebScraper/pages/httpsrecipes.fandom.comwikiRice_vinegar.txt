 About rice vinegar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Rice vinegar on Wikipedia 
 The  rice vinegar  is a vinegar made from fermented rice or rice wine in China and Japan. Japanese rice vinegar is very mild and mellow and ranges in colour from colourless through pale yellow. There are two distinct types of Japanese vinegar: one is made from fermented rice and the other is made by adding rice vinegar to the  sake . Chinese rice vinegars are stronger than Japanese ones, and range in colour from clear to various shades of red and brown. Chinese and especially Japanese vinegars are very mild and sweet as compared to more acidic Western vinegars which, for that reason, are just inappropriate substitutes for rice vinegars.
