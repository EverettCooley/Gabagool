 Ingredients : 
 a 3-3½ lb  chicken , halved, quartered or cut into pieces. 
 Marinade for chicken : 
 1 tsp minced  dried hot chile pepper 
 1 tsp minced  garlic 
 2 tbsp minced  shallot 
 1 tsp  paprika 
 2 tsp  Chinese five-spice powder 
 2 tsp crumbled dried  rosemary 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Sauce : 
 1 cup minced  shallot 
 ½ cup minced  garlic 
 1½ cups minced  red bell pepper  (or smaller qty of hotter  red peppers  if desired) 
 ¼ cup  canola oil 
 ½ cup sweet  paprika 
 1 cup  grated coconut 
 ½ cup natural  peanut butter 
 1½ cups  chicken stock 
 2  bay leaves 
 3 tbsp  canola oil 
 1 baking  potato  (or 4-5  new potatoes ) 
 Directions : 
 Mix marinade ingredients, rub into  chicken  and marinate covered in fridge overnight. 
 Adding a little  oil  to the marinade helps the rub stick to the  chicken . 
 Sweat shallots,  garlic  and  peppers  in  oil  over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the  peppers  are softened. 
 Add  paprika ,  coconut ,  peanut butter ,  bay leaf  and  chicken stock . 
 Bring to a boil, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about ten minutes. 
 Discard the  bay leaves . 
 Keep warm. 
 Heat  oil  medium high in a fry pan and brown the  chicken  well with the  potato  cut into one inch cubes. 
 Even better, grill the  chicken , and brown  potato  separately. 
 Transfer  chicken  and  potatoes  to baking dish, spoon 2 cups of the sauce over, and bake in a 350°F oven for about 30 minutes if in pieces, a little longer if in halves. 
 Finish with remaining sauce, and serve.
