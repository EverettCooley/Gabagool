About pork belly : 
 Belly of pork  is a lower-cost cut of meat, due to the relatively high traces of fat in it. However, this means that the cuts are ideal for longer cooking periods and recipes where the meat might dry out. Belly provides steaks (with or without bones), cubes and strips as well as being a cheaper roasting joint. The smaller cuts are ideal for barbecues and casseroles. Similarly, you can buy a mini joint of boned and rolled belly pork  which can also be cooked over the barbecue in foil then browned with no foil a few minutes prior to serving. Mini or normal-sized belly joints can be trimmed by the butcher, but many people like to have the skin replaced or left on to provide crackling.
