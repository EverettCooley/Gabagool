This method of cooking  rice  is great by itself and is only restricted by your imagination as to what liquid to use. One of my favorites is  orange juice  and shredded  coconut . This is very good served chilled on a piece of  lettuce  as a salad with roast  pork . Also can be cooked with plain  salt  and  water  for steamed  rice . Frying the  rice  first removes the starch coating from the outside of the kernels and keeps it from sticking together in a goo-ball.
 This recipe will fill the tums of about four hungry people
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 pieces of  chicken  (I prefer thighs myself) 
 1½ cups  rice  ( not  minute rice) 
 3 cups  chicken broth  or bouillon 
 1 cup chopped  onion 
 1 pkg frozen  peas  and  carrots 
 ½ stick  butter  or  margarine 
 oil  of  achiote 
 yellow  food coloring  (or  saffron  if you can afford it) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Brown and partially fry the  chicken  in  achiote oil  (if you can't find  achiote oil , sprinkle generously with  paprika , rub it in for color, and fry in Crisco or equivalent). 
 Drain on paper towels and put aside. 
 Put the broth,  onions , and ½ tsp yellow  food coloring  in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. 
 A little  salt  may be added. 
 While the liquid is coming to a boil, fry the raw  rice  in a Dutch oven or other covered oven container. This should be stirred constantly. 
 When the liquid boils, pour it in with the  rice . 
 Cover and put in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. 
 In a greased 8 x 14 inch cake pan (i prefer glass), mix the cooked  rice  and the  peas  and  carrots . 
 Lay the  chicken  pieces on top and cook at 350 degrees in the oven for about 20 minutes.
