 Wikipedia Article  About Nondairy topping on Wikipedia 
 Cool Whip is a brand of imitation whipped cream with < 2% milk product content, called a "whipped topping" by its manufacturer. It is used as a dessert topping, and in some no-bake pie recipes.
 Cool Whip was introduced in 1965 by Kraft Foods.
 Cool Whip is made of water, corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated coconut and palm kernel oil, < 2% sodium caseinate, natural and artificial flavorings, xanthan and guar gums, polysorbate 80, sorbitan monostearate, and beta carotene. Sodium caseinate is a milk protein, so Cool Whip may be unacceptable to those avoiding dairy products for medical, ethical, or religious reasons.
 It is sold in 8 oz plastic tubs, and requires refrigeration. Each nine gram serving provides 25 calories of which 15 are from fat.

 a longer shelf life; 
 low dairy content
