BAKED POTATOES SUPREME
 
2 large Idaho potatoes, baked
1 egg, hard cooked, peeled, and grated coarsely
4 cups broccoli, chopped (optional)
1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese (reserve a few spoonfuls for topping)
4 strips bacon, sautï¿½ed and crumbled or chopped
4 teaspoons butter (2 for each potato)
1/4 cup sour cream
1/3 teaspoon each salt and pepper
 Wash and cut up broccoli (optional), set aside.
 Scrub potatoes, then rub with a small amount of vegetable, peanut or olive oil. Cook in microwave until fork tender, about 10 minutes, depending on size
of potatoes and wattage of your oven.
 While potatoes are cooking, steam or simmer broccoli until just tender but still crisp. When broccoli becomes a bright green, drain, remove from heat and
return to pan with cover briefly to finish cooking. If broccoli becomes an olive green, it's overcooked.
 Cut an oval circle from top of potatoes and scoop out meat while still hot. In a small bowl, mash together with cheese, bacon, and sour cream and butter
and coarsely chopped egg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return mixture to potatoes.
 Top with remaining cheese and broil 5 minutes more, garnish with fresh herbs and serve.
 Variations: Add 1-2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, dill, or rosemary. Use olive oil instead of butter. Use onion dip instead of sour cream. Use Parmesan
cheese instead of mozzarella. Substitute Serrano ham or prosciutto for bacon.
 Enjoy!
