Ingredients : 
 1 pk  Garden Sausage 
 Fresh hot-tasting  powdered ginger 
 Kikkoman lite  soy sauce 
 1 package  wonton wrappers 
 a few Chinese-style  pea pods 
 Directions : 
 warm 4 patties at a time in the microwave for about 30 seconds, which is hopefully time enough to thaw them but not make them too hot to handle. 
 Lay out several won ton wrappers, then put a little wad of the Garden Sausage (I got about 6 dumplings per patty) in the center of each wrapper. Sprinkle with  ginger  and soy sauce. 
 I put a little slice of pea pod in about Â½ of the dumplings just to make it more interesting. 
 Pinch the won ton wrappers closed at the top. 
 Put as many as will fit side by side into a steamer basket in a sauce pan (at least that's how I did it because the  rice  steamer was occupado) with a little boiling  water  in the bottom. 
 Cover and steam for 5+ minutes. 
 The won ton wrappers I used came covered in a little  flour  and I figured that when the wrappers looked moist rather than floury they were done. 
 Serve with little dishes of hot Asian-style  mustard  and /or light soy sauce.
