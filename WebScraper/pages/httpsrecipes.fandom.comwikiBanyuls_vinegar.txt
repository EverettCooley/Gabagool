Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Banyuls_vinegar

A wine vinegar made from grapes grown in the French region of Banyuls-sur-Mer. The varietal mix of this vinegar includes primarily Granache noir, Grenache gris and a minor amount of Carignane grapes. Aged in oak barrels, this vinegar matures for over 5 years developing a somewhat tart or sour tasting vinegar that develops a complex nutty flavor. It combines well with salad vinaigrettes made from nut or olive oils or works well as a deglaze for hearty meats, earthy vegetables, or as a fish and lean poultry marinade.
