Almond Ice Cream
 1/4 cup blanched almonds
2 cups milk
2/3 cup heavy cream
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup superfine sugar
1 tsp kirsch
 
Pound the almond into paste.
Add milk and heavy cream, mix thoroughly together.
In a saucepan, heat the almond mixture to a boil. Remove from heat.
In a bowl, mix egg yolks, sugar and kirsch for 5 minutes.
Add almond milk and mix well with wooden spoon.
Heat the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes without letting it boil. Stir
continuously. Then allow it to cool.
Strain through a sieve into ice cream maker and freeze until the ice cream
is
thoroughly firm.
 I think you can probably use instant almond paste or almond extract instead
of pounding almond. Be careful that the paste or extract is sweetened or
not.
Also, you can add chopped fruits or nuts into the mixture. Just use your
imagination.
 Enjoy.
