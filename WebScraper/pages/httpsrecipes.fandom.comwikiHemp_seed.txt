 Wikipedia Article  About Hemp seed on Wikipedia 
 Hemp may be grown also for food (the seed) but in the UK cultivation licences are not available for this purpose. Within Defra (the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) hemp is treated as purely a non-food crop, despite the fact that seed can and does appear on the UK market as a perfectly legal food product.
 In Canada, hemp seed food products are common and range from carbonated beverages to frozen waffles. Many companies produce value added hemp seed items that include the oils of the seed, whole hemp grain (which is sterilized as per international law), hulled hemp seed (the whole seed without the mineral rich outer shell), hemp flour, hemp cake (a by-product of pressing the seed for oil) and hemp protein powder.
