About jamon Serrano : 
 This popular, fatty, cured ham is similar to Italy's Proscuitto - clean ham salted for 2 weeks, thoroughly washed, hung dry for six to eighteen months in warm Medterranian climes and finally left to age in cool dry place for another 6 to 18 months. Even unlike Iberico ham, this is cooked before eating.
