 About Raab : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Raab on Wikipedia 
 Rapini is a common vegetable in Chinese and Italian cuisine. It is also known by other names, including Broccoli di Rape, Broccoli di Rabe, or Broccoli di Raab. Despite this name, the plant is not closely related to broccoli. It is similar to but much more bitter than Chinese broccoli. The plant has various scientific classification designations, including Brassica rapa ruvo, Brassica rapa rapifera, Brassica ruvo, Brassica campestris ruvo, and Brassica rapa rapa (a name normally assigned to the turnip).
 Rapini has many spiked leaves that surround a green bud which looks very similar to a small head of broccoli. The flavor of rapini has been described as nutty, bitter, pungent, and 'an acquired taste'. Rapini is a source of vitamins A, C, and K, as well as potassium, calcium, and iron. It is one of the most popular vegetables in China, especially in Hong Kong.
 A green bitter vegetable unless harvested young. The leaves, stems and florets are eaten. Really good saut√©ed with garlic and olive oil and served over pasta.
 The vegetable probably descends from a wild herb, a relative of the turnip, that grew either in China or the Mediterranean region. It is now grown throughout the world. Rapini is available all year long, but its peak season is from fall to spring.
