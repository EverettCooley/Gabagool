 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Green  plantains 
 vegetable oil  for frying 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  plantain  and cut off both ends. 
 Thinly slice the  plantain  into ¼ - ½ inch rounds. 
 In a large, heavy skillet, heat the  vegetable oil  over medium heat keeping a close watch on it. 
 Once the  oil  sizzles when a slice of  plantain  is added, add several  plantain  slices and brown them for about 2 minutes on each side. 
 Transfer them to towels to drain the excess  oil . 
 On a cutting board, use a rolling pin to flatten each slice into a flat round. 
 Add the flattened rounds into the  oil  once again and brown on each side for a minute more on each side. 
 Drain again on the towels, add  salt  and  pepper  and serve at once.
