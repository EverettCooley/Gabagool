 Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 cup white wine
1/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons honey
 
 Cooking Directions
Heat the olive oil in the pressure cooker with the lid off, over medium-high 
heat. Add chicken and brown on all sides as evenly as possible. Remove 
chicken from the cooker, and season with salt, pepper, paprika and marjoram. 
Drain and discard fat from the cooker, and mix in wine and chicken broth, 
scraping any bits of food that are stuck to the bottom.
Return chicken to the cooker over medium-high heat, secure the lid, and 
bring to high pressure for 8 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Reduce 
pressure before opening the lid. The internal temperature of the chicken 
meat should be at 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
Remove chicken to a serving dish, and add the apricot preserves, vinegar, 
ginger and honey to the pot. Bring to a boil, and cook uncovered until the 
sauce has reduced into a thick and syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes. 
Spoon over chicken and serve.
