There are several aromatics and herbs that are often used in Indian cooking: sweet herbs like shatavari and ashvagandha have a cooling taste. Tamarind, lemon and gooseberry are slightly heat producing and sour to taste. Rock salt is recommended, as it is cooling and beneficial for the eyes. Herbs like hing (asafetida), vavding and lasan (garlic) are pungent and act as antidote to obesity and weight gain. Jeera (cumin), coriander seeds and neem, which are bitter to taste, reduce the accumulation of toxins. Turmeric is an astringent and cooling herb. Various herbal formulae combine all the 6 tastes in order to ensure a balanced combination for daily intake.
