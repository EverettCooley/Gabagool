 Description : 
       Navajo Peach Pudding     
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup Honey 
 1 lb Fresh  peaches , pitted and peeled 
 1 cup  water 
 1 pkt  unflavored gelatin 
 1 cup  whipping cream 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a food processor, puree the honey and  peaches  together. 
 In a small saucepan, mix together the  water  and  gelatin  and let stand 1 minute. 
 Over medium-low heat, stir mixture until the  gelatin  has completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. 
 Remove from heat, slowly add the  gelatin  mixture to the  peach  honey and blend thoroughly. 
 Allow to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. 
 While the  peach  mixture is cooling, beat the  cream  until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes. 
 Fold the  whipped cream  into the  peach  pudding mixture in a circular motion, leaving swirls of white  cream  in the  peach  pudding. 
 Do not mix together completely. 
 Place the pudding in the refrigerator and chill until firm.
