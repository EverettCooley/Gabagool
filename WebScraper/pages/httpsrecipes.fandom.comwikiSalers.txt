The Salers (French: Le Salers) is a French cheese from the volcanic region in the mountains of Auvergne, central France. It is a pressed, uncooked cheese made from Salers cow's milk between the 15 April and 15 November. It is similar to Cantal cheese - which is produced from the same cows' milk when they are fed on hay  during the remaining months of the year - and has been estimated to have been fabricated in this region for at least 2000 years. It came to prominence when Maréchal de Sennecterre served it at the table of Louis XIV of France. Maréchal de Sennecterre is also responsible for the introduction of  Saint-Nectaire  and  Cantal . Salers has benefited from the Appellation d'origine contrôlée since 1961. It is best eaten between September and March, after an ageing time of nine months, but it is also excellent all year round.
 It is circular in shape, weighing around 40 kg.
