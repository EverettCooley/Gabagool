 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs  Chicken  livers 
 2 C  corn  meal 
 2 C  wheat germ 
 2  eggs 
 2 1/2 tsp. granulated  garlic  (not  salt ) 
 1/2 C dried  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Liquefy livers in food processor, pour into mixing bowl and add other ingredients. Mix until smooth like a brownie batter. Spread on a cookie sheet (1/2 sheet cake size) (I use parchment paper to line the pan) until it's evenly spread about 1/3 inch thick. Bake at 350 F for about 35 minutes. When cool cut into squares, or whatever shapes you prefer. I keep them in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator.
