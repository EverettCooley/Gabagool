 Many visitors will find it very easy to be a vegetarian in Haiti. The fish or chicken can be removed from the salads and these would still taste good, as they are complex, with many ingredients. The variety of eatable leaves and plants, the replacement of regular milk with coconut milk and fat with olive oil makes many dishes to be vegetarian: squash and green bean, potatoes, breadfruit pasta, all potato and leaves, poes, mix vegetables with rice, fruit cakes, banana desserts and many more. There is also a wide range of sandwiches with tomatoes, lettuce with herbs and seeds that replace the flavor of the animal products. In many restaurants and urban areas, traditional Haitian cuisine is often adjusted to fit lacto-ovo-vegetarian demands and although meat plays an important role in most Haitian dishes, it is possible to find excellent Haitian vegetarian cooking
