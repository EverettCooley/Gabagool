 Add the  egg  and  wine vinegar . 
 Slowly add the  water , as needed, mixing to form the dough, until well blended. 
 Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and knead gently until the dough becomes smooth, only a few seconds.

 Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each circle. 
 Brush  egg  wash around the edges of the dough. 
 Fold the edges up forming a pouch, and seal.
