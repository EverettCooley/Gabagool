Ingredients : 
 2 large  artichokes 
 1  lemon  (juice only) 
 2 tbsp virgin  olive oil 
 large  basil  leaves, sliced in strips 
 1 large  onion , white or yellow, sliced ¼-inch thick 
 salt 
 1 lbs fresh pod  peas   or  1 cup frozen  peas 
 finely chopped  parsley 
 freshly milled  pepper 
 1 tbsp  sweet butter   or  extra virgin  olive oil 
 lemon juice , to taste  or   champagne vinegar 
 Optional : 
 dash of sweetener (to balance flavours) 
 Directions : 
 Slice the upper ⅔ of the leaves off the artichokes, then break off the remaining leaves, snapping them off at the base. 
 Trim off the dark green Stubs, going around the  artichoke  with a paring knife. 
 Cut them in quarters, remove the fuzzy choke and slice each quarter into pieces ¼-to-½-inch thick. 
 As you work, rub the cut surfaces with  lemon  and put them in a bowl with the  lemon juice  and  water  to cover. 
 Gently warm the  olive oil  with half the  basil . 
 When it is fairly hot, but not sizzling, add the  onions  and the sliced artichokes. 
 Salt lightly and give them a stir to coat them with the  oil , then add ¾ cup  water  and cook over a medium-low flame. 
 As the  water  cooks off, add more, in ½-cup increments until the artichokes are cooked, about 25 minutes. 
 Add the  peas  and continue cooking until they are done. 
 Let any liquids reduce until they are syrupy. 
 Taste and season with  salt . 
 Add the rest of the  basil , the  parsley  and the  butter  or  olive oil . 
 To brighten the flavors, stir in a little  lemon juice  or  champagne vinegar  to taste.
