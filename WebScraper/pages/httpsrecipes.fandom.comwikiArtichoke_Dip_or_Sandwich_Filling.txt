This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich. I hope you like it, and i promise not to post too often until i actually learn to measure and write :-).
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pack frozen  artichoke hearts 
 Italian herbs 
 balsamic vinegar 
 1 tsp  olive oil 
 1  onion , chopped fine 
 3  garlic  cloves peeled and squinched up into little pieces 
 1 large package of  mushrooms  sliced 
 ½ cup or so fat-free  parmesan cheese 
 2 spoonsful of fat-free  mayo  and fat-free  sour cream 
 1 dash  worcestershireshshchestshire  (you know what I mean) 
 Directions : 
 Marinate  artichoke hearts  with  Italian herbs  and some  balsamic vinegar . 
 I myself add a teaspoon or so of  olive oil  (someone will be coming to measure me now, I'm sure). 
 Stir  artichoke  hearts and rest of ingredients together. 
 Don't put in so much white stuff that it is too moist because the  mushrooms  will release moisture and then it will get gross. 
 Bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes in a French white corning ware casserole. 
 If you put it in anything else it will explode.
