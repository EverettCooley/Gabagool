Ingredients : 
 1 x Creme Anglaise 
 10 lg  egg  whites 
 1 ea Bean,  vanilla 
 2 oz  Sugar 
 1 qt  water  OR 
 1 qt  milk 
 Caramel 
 5 tb  Sugar 
 5 tb  water 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, whip the  egg  whites until they are very stiff. Add the  vanilla bean  paste. Add  Sugar  (amount of  Sugar  varies - it has to bind the  eggs ). In a large saucepan, heat (but do NOT boil)  milk  or  water . Shape the beaten  egg  whites into quenelles and float them in the liquid to poach gently. 
 After 2 minutes, turn the  egg  puffs with a spoon dipped in cold  water . Cook for 3 more minutes, then remove to a baking pan. Drain the pan, and briefly reserve the quenelles. Boil the  Sugar  and  water  in a saucepan until it forms caramel. Scoop Creme Anglaise into the bottoms of your serving bowls and then place a quenelle in each bowl. 
 Sprinkle with roasted  almonds  and top with caramel sauce. Garnish with fresh fruit of the season.
