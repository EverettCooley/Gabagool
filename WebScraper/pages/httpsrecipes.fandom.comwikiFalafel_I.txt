 Comments: this dish is a favorite among Arab immigrants. 
 Falafel or "ta'amia" are patties made from dried beans, splendidly spiced, deep-fried, then eaten as a snack. 
 These are traditionally served as a meat substitute and make a great sandwich. 
 Fill pita bread with falafel, sliced  tomatoes , sliced  onion ,  lettuce  and  yogurt . 
 Delicious!.
