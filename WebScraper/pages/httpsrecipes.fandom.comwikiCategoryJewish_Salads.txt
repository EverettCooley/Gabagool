 Baba ghanouj (eggplant with tehina salad) is a special dish, prepared easily out of ripe eggplants, onions, lime juice and lime slices, parsley, tehina, crushed cloves and cayenne pepper. Due to the fact that cucumber is a frequently met aliment in the Jewish cuisine, there is a famous cucumber salad: the ugorkasalata, flavored with sugar, cumin seeds and white vinegar.
