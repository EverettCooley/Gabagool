      Avocado leaves     
 About Avocado leaves : 
 The leaves from the avocado tree are commonly used as a fresh or dried seasoning in food dishes prepared in Central Mexico. They are used in meat dishes, soups and stews, providing a somewhat bitter flavor with an anise tasting overtone. Some studies have been undertaken to determine if various species of avocado leaves are toxic and how harmful they may be for consumption. Although it appears as if the toxic agent is present in a species of the  Guatemalan avocado , the leaves of other varieties continue to be used as seasonings, apparently with the belief that the amount used is so small that it is not harmful for consumption. The avocado leaf is also used as a garnish for appetizers, salads and other food dishes. 
 The leaf's slightly bitter taste adds flavor to various Mexican dishes like simmered meats and soups.
