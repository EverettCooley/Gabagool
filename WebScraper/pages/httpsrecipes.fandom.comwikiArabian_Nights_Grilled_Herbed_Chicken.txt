Description : 
 
 This recipe yields 4 servings.
 
 Wine recommendation: a full-bodied  zinfandel  with  plum ,  cherry , and  black pepper  notes makes a great match for the  fennel  in the moist  chicken . 
 Beer recommendation: a traditional marzen beer will have the light body and spicy profile to match this refreshingly herbaceous  chicken . 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup finely-chopped  flat leaf parsley 
 ½ cup finely-chopped fresh  fennel  tops (or 2 tsp dried  fennel seed ) 
 ½ cup finely-chopped  green onions 
 1 carton non-fat plain  yoghurt  - (8 oz) 
 salt  to taste 
 freshly-ground  black pepper  to taste 
 1  chicken  - (about 3 lbs) butterflied 
 1 tsp  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Combine  parsley ,  fennel ,  onions ,  yogurt , in a glass bowl. 
 Season with  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Cover and chill until ready to use. 
 Remove excess fat from  chicken . 
 Rinse and pat dry. 
 To butterfly  chicken , use poultry shears or a sharp knife to split the bird lengthwise along one side of the backbone. 
 With the breast side up, pull the body open, pressing down firmly on the breast until the rib bones crack and the bird lies reasonably flat. 
 Place fingers between the skin and meat of the  chicken  to separate and make space for the herb mixture. 
 Place herb mixture under  chicken  skin, pushing it in gently under skin until all parts of meat are covered. 
 Massage the  chicken  to evenly distribute herb mixture under the skin. 
 Let sit at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator. 
 Brush  chicken  skin lightly with  oil ; season with  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Place breast side up in center of cooking grate and grill for 45 to 55 minutes or until the juices run clear and the skin is crisp. 
 It is not necessary to turn  chicken .
