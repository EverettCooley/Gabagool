 ↑   Mojo is a citrus-based sauce associated with Cuban cuisine, but variations are found throughout South America and the Caribbean. Mojo also can include herbs, garlic, onions, salt, cumin, red pepper and olive oil. A mojo marinade is a thicker form, typically made with grapefruit and orange juices and vinegar. Goya is among the makers of commercial mojo marinades.
