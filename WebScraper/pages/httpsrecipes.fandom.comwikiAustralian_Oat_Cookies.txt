AUSTRALIAN OAT COOKIES
 1 cup plain flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup coconut
1/2 cup sultanas (golden raisins)
1/8 cup chopped dried apricots
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 Tablespoons Golden Syrup (corn syrup)
1 1/2 teaspoons bicarbonate of Soda (baking soda)
6 oz butter
3 teaspoons hot water
 In a saucepan melt butter and golden syrup. When melted, add
the bicarbonate of soda which has been dissolved in 1 teaspoon
of the hot water. When this all foams up, add to the dry
ingredients and mix well. Add remainder of water
 Roll into balls and place well apart on tray. Cook at 350
degrees Fahrenheit until golden brown, then cool on tray. She
doesn't say how long to cook them, maybe if someone tries
this, they can let us know. Cookies are usually done in 12 to
15 minutes, so I would start checking them closely about then.
 Substitute other dried fruit for the raisins and apricots
