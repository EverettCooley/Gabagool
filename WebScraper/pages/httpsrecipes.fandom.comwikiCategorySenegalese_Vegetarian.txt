 The demand for a vegetarian cuisine is low – even non-existent – in Senegal. However, fresh vegetables are readily available in all local homes and restaurant chefs use the best of the best plants and herbs to prepare delicious salads. Local plants are used with local or imported spices to create light and refreshing salads. In Senegal, special sauces are often created just for the salad, so that they blend well with the flavor of the vegetables. Vegetarian salads are not deliberately prepared, but, in general, most salads prepared by chefs in Senegal don’t contain meat at all.
