      Garbanzo Soup     
 Ingredients : 
 2½ quart  water 
 5 cloves  garlic 
 3 fresh  oregano  sprigs 
 2 whole  cloves 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 1 tbsp ground  cumin 
 1 tsp  black pepper 
 3  bay leaves , broken 
 1 or 2 fresh  basil  sprigs 
 5  chicken bouillon  cubes 
 1 frying  chicken  cut up 
 Vegetables : 
 juice of two  limes 
 1 medium  zucchini , chopped 
 1  yellow onion , chopped 
 2 stalks  celery , chopped 
 1  carrot , chopped 
 1  green bell pepper , seeded and chopped 
 1 can (17 ounces)  garbanzo beans , drained 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  water  to a boil, and then add all the stock ingredients, including the  chicken . 
 Skim the foam from the top as the soup simmers for 1 to 1½ hr. 
 Remove the  chicken , de-bone it and shred the meat when cool. 
 Strain the stock and chill. 
 This hardens the fat for easy removal. 
 Remove fat from stock. 
 Reheat and add the juice of two  limes . 
 Add all the vegetables except the  beans  and cook just until tender-crisp, about 20 minutes. 
 Add the shredded  chicken  and  garbanzo beans . 
 Heat until  chicken  and beans are hot throughout.
