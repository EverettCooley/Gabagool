The  fiber  cereal  All-Bran Strawberry Medley  was launched by  Kellogg's  in early 2008. The cereal is made up of  bran  flakes and squares complemented by  granola  clusters and dried  strawberries . The cereal is sold in supermarkets through the United States and Canada.
 Apparently, the cereal is part of Kelloggs' All-Bran 10-Day Challenge—a program designed to "remove obstacles in consuming enough fiber"  [1]  This cereal is supposed to make it easier for people to participate in the 10-Day Challenge. In an article in Food Business Review John Johanson, a practicing gastroenterologist at the Beloit Clinic, in Beloit, Wisconsin, explains that "Unfortunately, people often don't think that high-fiber foods taste good. Once they taste new All-Bran Strawberry Medley, which offers three times the fiber of the leading fiber supplement, they will be eager to swap their supplements."
 
 Reviews : 
 Since fiber cereals are usually viewed as bland, reviewers at Phoenix's CBS 5 found it "surprising to find so much flavor in this cereal."  [2]  While the cereal had the "trademark heaviness of fiber-rich cereals", [2]  it wasn't at all unpleasant since the cereal was also lightly sweetened and contained lots of strawberries.
 The reviewers of Tulsa World's Lunch Bunch gave this cereal an "A", promising that "[if] you like strawberries and strawberry flavoring, you will like this cereal. [3]  Reviewers felt that the flakes, bran squares and granola flavor give this product a good texture and raved about the fact that the cereal contains 40% of the recommended daily value for fiber.
