 Ingredients : 
 1½ cup  orange juice 
 1 cup  white wine 
 1 tsp  lemon peel , grated 
 1 x  apple 
 1 x  pear 
 1 x  banana 
 2 lb mixed fruit 
 ⅓ cup  vanilla sugar 
 mint  leaves, optional 
 Directions : 
 Seasonal fruits ( strawberries ,  cherries ,  nectarines , mangoes, Italian plums, seedless  grapes , etc.). 
 Pour  orange juice  and wine into a large glass serving bowl and stir in  lemon peel . 
 Peel and core  apple  and  pear , then cut them into small cubes. 
 Slice the  banana  thin. 
 Hold the fruit over the bowl and chop it on a plate so you don't lose any of the juices. 
 The larger fruits should be pitted, peeled and cubed. 
 Cherries  should be pitted and left whole. 
 Stir the fruit into the liquid as soon as it is cut (the juices and wine will help retain the colors). 
 Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
 The macedonia can be made the night before. 
 Serve lightly chilled garnished with  mint  leaves.
