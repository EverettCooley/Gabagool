Ingredients : 
 
 1 pound boneless skinless  chicken breast  halves 
 2 tablespoons fresh  lime juice 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 tsp ground  cumin 
 1 tbsp ground  red chili pepper 
 1 tsp crushed  oregano  or  thyme 
 ½ tsp  garlic powder 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 2 tbsp  canola  (or other)  oil 
 1  jalapeño  chile, seeded and minced (wear gloves) 
 ½ – ¾ cup  beer 
 Directions : 
 Cut chicken crosswise into ⅜-inch-wide strips; place in shallow glass dish. 
 Combine all ingredients and stir until dry ingredients are incorporated. 
 Pour mixture over chicken; toss to coat well. Cover; marinate in refrigerator at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours, stirring mixture occasionally. 
 Soak 8 (10- to 12-inch) skewers 20 minutes in cold water to prevent them from burning; drain. Prepare grill for direct cooking. 
 Drain chicken; reserve marinade. Weave 3 to 4 chicken strips accordion-style onto each skewer. Brush chicken with reserved marinade. Discard remaining marinade. 
 Place skewers on grid. Grill skewers on uncovered grill over medium-hot coals 6 to 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink, turning halfway through grilling time.
