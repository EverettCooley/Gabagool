 Makes 6 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 Vegetable  oil spray 
 ⅓ cup fresh  orange juice 
 ⅓ cup  sugar 
 4 large  egg whites 
 ¼ cup unsweetened  cocoa  powder 
 2 tbsp  orange liqueur 
 ¾ cup vanilla ice milk, softened 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 300 °F. 
 Grease six 5 oz. custard cups with vegetable oil spray. 
 In a small saucepan, cook orange juice and sugar over med-high heat, until mixture has a syrupy consistency, about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and reserve. 
 In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff, but stop before dry peaks form. 
 Pour syrup over the egg whites, and continue beating for 2 minutes. 
 Add cocoa and liqueur, and beat only until well mixed. Pour into prepared custard cups. 
 Bake 12 minutes, or until souffles are puffed. Do not overbake, or souffles will become tough. 
 To serve, spoon 2 tbsp softened vanilla ice milk into the center of each souffle. 
 Serve immediately.
