 Description : 
 Approximately 4 servings
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  glutinous rice 
1 pound  Pork  or ground  Pork 
1 - 2  green onions 
2 slices  fresh ginger

 Directions : 
 Soak the  glutinous rice  in  water  for at least 6 – 8 hours (preferably 
overnight). Drain well in a sieve or colander. Make sure the  rice  is dry before using.
 Mince or grind the  Pork  if not using ground  Pork . Mince the  ginger  and 
chop the  green onions  finely. Lightly beat the  egg  and combine in a bowl with the light soy sauce,  sherry ,  water ,  cornstarch ,  Sugar , and the  salt .
 Take about 1 tablespoon and form into a ball. Continue with the rest of the  Pork  mixture. Roll the  Pork  balls lightly over the dried  glutinous rice  until they are completely coated.
 Place the porkballs on a heatproof dish 1/2 to 1-inch apart. Place the 
dish on a rack in a pot, cover, and steam over boiling  water  for between 25 – 35 minutes. Pearl balls are normally served with soy sauce.
 Variation: Add a few Chinese black  Mushrooms  or  water chestnuts  to the  Pork  mixture.
