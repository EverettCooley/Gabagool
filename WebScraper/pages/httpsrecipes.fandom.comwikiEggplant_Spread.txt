 Makes about 2 cups 
 Ingredients : 
 2 x 1Â½-pound  eggplants 
 1 medium  onion , minced 
 1  garlic  clove, minced 
 2 tablespoons minced fresh  flat-leafed parsley  leaves, plus  parsley  sprigs for garnish 
 1 teaspoon minced fresh  thyme  leaves 
 2 teaspoons minced fresh  basil  leaves 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons  red wine vinegar 
 2 tablespoons drained bottled  capers , chopped fine 
 pita , cut into wedges, as an accompaniment 
 Directions : 
 Pierce the  eggplants  in several places with a fork and grill them on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are very soft. (alternatively, the  eggplants  may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat, turning them, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are soft.) 
 Let the  eggplants  cool until they can be handled, halve them, and discard as many seeds as possible. 
 Scrape the flesh away from the skin and squeeze the  eggplant  gently between paper towels to remove as much excess liquid as possible. 
 In a bowl, mash the  eggplant  coarsely, stir in the  onion , the  garlic , the minced herbs, the  oil , the  vinegar , the  capers , and  salt  and  pepper  to taste, and let the spread stand, covered and chilled, for 3 hours to allow the flavors to develop. (The  eggplant  spread may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled). 
 Garnish the  eggplant  spread with the  parsley  sprigs and serve it with the pita wedges.
