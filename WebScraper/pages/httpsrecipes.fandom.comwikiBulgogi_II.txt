      Bulgogi     
 This recipe is for 6 servings.
 
 Preparation: 6 hours and 25 minutes. 
 Ingredients : 
 4 lbs  short rib of beef  (can also use tri tip, and  flank steak ) 
 ⅔ cup  green onions , thinly sliced 
 ½ cup  soy sauce 
 ½ cup  water 
 ¼ cup  sesame oil 
 2½ tablespoons  brown sugar , packed 
 2 tablespoons  sesame seeds , lightly toasted and crushed 
 2  garlic  cloves, crushed 
 1 tablespoon fresh  ginger , grated 
 ½ teaspoon  red pepper flakes 
 ⅛ teaspoon  Szechwan pepper , ground 
 Directions : 
 Trim  beef  to ½" thick pieces. 
 If you are using tri tip or  flank steak , be sure to cut across the grain. 
 Combine everything except for the  beef  in large a ziplock bag. 
 Close the bag and massage the bag until everything is well mixed. 
 Add the  beef . 
 Be sure the bag is closed tightly. 
 Massage again until all of the meat is completely coated. 
 Place in the refrigerator for 4 – 6 hours. 
 Turn the bag occasionally during this process to ensure it marinates evenly. 
 When you are ready to cook, remove the  beef  from the bag and pour the marinade into a small bowl. 
 Meat can be grilled on a BBQ (this is the traditional method), broiled or even pan fried. 
 Based on the thinness of your  beef , it will take between 3 – 6 minutes to cook per side. 
 Be sure to brush on additional marinade when you flip the  meat .
