 Golden samphire Recipes : 
 Remove any flower heads and any woody bits at the base of the stalk. Drop soft and tender leaves into boiling water and scald for 2 mins. The resulting green water may be drunk when cool as it is full of vitamins. The scalded samphire leaves may be drizzled with a little oil and eaten as a vegetable hot or eaten when cold with cold meat or hors d'oevre. Once boiled the leaves can be used as a delicious added ingredient in your camp fire corned beef hash or added to boiled potatoes to eat with broiled fish. Mmmm, so tasty - and good for your digestion and inner cleanliness!
