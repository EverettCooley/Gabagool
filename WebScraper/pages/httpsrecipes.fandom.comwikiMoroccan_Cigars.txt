 Description : 
 Cigars are a great appetizer before any meal. Served with dip, they make a nice change from more conventional hors d'œuvre.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium  Onion , finely chopped 
 1/3 cup  olive oil 
 15oz lean ground  Beef 
 2 teaspoons ground  cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground  allspice 
 1/4 teaspoon  ground ginger 
 ground  pepper 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh  parsley 
 5  eggs 
 1 lb  filo  pastry 
 6oz  butter , melted 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Firstly, preheat the oven to 300F. 
 Prepare the filling for the cigars first. Cook the  Onion  in a pan with the hot  olive oil  for 10 minutes, and then add the  Beef , simultaneously crushing it with a fork. 
 Add all of the seasonings and spices to the  Beef  and cook for a further 10–15 minutes. Keep stirring the mixture so it doesn't burn. 
 Beat the  eggs  in a small bowl, making sure they are well mixed before pouring over the meat and cooking for a further 2 minutes. The  egg  mixture should start to go creamy. 
 Take the mixture off the heat and allow it to cool. 
 Now, cut the  filo  pastry into rectangles and place them in a pile with a damp cloth on top. Leave it for a few minutes. 
 Brush the rectangle on top with melted  butter  and put a small amount of the filling on one of the edges. Then roll it into a cigar, tucking the edges in as you go. Repeat this for all of them. 
 Warm the last of the  oil  and fry each cigar, ensuring they are brown on all sides. Drain them and place in warm oven until it is time to serve them!
