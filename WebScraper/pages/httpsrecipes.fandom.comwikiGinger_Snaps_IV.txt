Ingredients : 
 1 cup  molasses 
 ½ teaspoon  baking soda 
 ½ cup  shortening 
 1 tablespoon  ginger 
 3¼ cups  flour 
 1½ teaspoons  salt 
 Directions : 
 Heat  molasses  to boiling-point and pour over  shortening . 
 Add dry ingredients mixed and sifted. 
 Chill thoroughly. 
 Toss one-fourth of mixture on a floured board and roll as thinly as possible; shape with a small round cutter, first dipped in  flour . 
 Place near together on a buttered sheet and bake in a moderate oven. 
 Gather up the trimmings and roll with another portion of dough. 
 During rolling, the bowl containing mixture should be kept in a cool place, or it will be necessary to add more  flour  to dough, which makes cookies hard rather than crisp and short.
