 Koljivo (Serbian Cyrillic: кољиво, Romanian: colivă) (also called "žito", which means "wheat" in Serbian) is a traditional meal made by cooking whole (or sometimes ground) wheat seeds, with some sugar and ground walnuts added. It is used in several religious rituals, for example it is carried and consumed on the graveyard during burying ritual, slavas, in the Christmas meal etc. For its pleasant taste, it is consumed in other non-religuous conditions as well, often with cream on top.
