 About Beer : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Beer on Wikipedia 
 Beer is the world's oldest and most popular alcoholic beverage. It is produced through the fermentation of starch-based material, commonly barley, though cassava root in Africa, potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among other starch sources, have been used.
 Only beverages produced by this method are considered to be beer. Neither alcoholic beverages made from the fermentation of sugars derived from nonstarch sources (e.g., grape juice or honey), nor beverages which are distilled after fermentation should be classified as such.
 Because the ingredients and procedures used to make beer can differ, characteristics such as taste and colour may also vary. While local names for beers made with the same methods and ingredients may vary, the similarities of method and ingredients can be detected to form a study of the nature of beer styles.
