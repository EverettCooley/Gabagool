 Ingredients : 
 chicken stock  - as needed, about 1½ gallons 
 2 cups chopped  shallot 
 ⅔ cups  olive oil 
 9⅔ cups  arborio rice 
 2 cups dry  white wine 
 salt  - as needed 
 2⅔ cups  Parmesan cheese , grated 
 ¾ cup chopped  parsley ,  basil  or  cilantro 
 freshly ground  white pepper  - as needed

 2  California avocados 
 3 tbsp fresh  lime juice 
 Avocado salsa : 
 8  California avocados  (4 pounds), cut into ⅜-inch dice 
 1½ pounds  tomatoes , diced (⅜-inch) and drained 
 6 ounces (1½ cups)  green onion , thinly sliced 
 ½ cup fresh  lime juice 
 ½ tablespoon  salt  or to taste 
 Directions : 
 Bring stock to a simmer; keep hot over low heat. 
 Meanwhile, sauté  shallot  in  olive oil  until just tender, about 3 minutes. 
 Stir in  rice , sauté, stirring constantly, until outer covering is translucent, about 2 minutes. 
 Deglaze with wine; cook until almost all wine has evaporated. 
 Stir in 1 tablespoon  salt . 
 Stir about 1 cup simmering stock into  rice  until almost all liquid has evaporated. 
 Continue stirring in stock 1 cup at a time, until risotto has cooked 12 minutes.

 Immediately turn risotto out on an oiled sheet pan, spreading ½-inch thick; cool. 
 Cool remaining stock; reserve for per-order preparation. 
 Risotto can be made up to 1 day ahead; store, tightly covered, refrigerated.

 Slice  avocado  about ⅜-inch thick; brush with  lime juice . 
 Per order :

 Serve in a heated  pasta  bowl.
