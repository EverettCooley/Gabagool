Description : 
 Similar to the original, modern beefsteak, this tangy beef dish is made and infused with real beer and condiments and usually delivers a bold, red-hot aroma that it relishes and enhances with the bay leaf and alcohol content grilled to smoky perfection. Onion powder and balsamic vinegar often respectively replace the real onions and the white vinegar and work for this, too. Trust us, you will never be deceived.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6  sirloin tip steaks 
 ¼ cup  brown sugar 
 1 ½ tbsp.  whole grain mustard 
 1 tbsp.  white vinegar 
 1  onion , sliced or minced, red, white, yellow only  or  (3-5 ⅞ tablespoons onion powder) 
 1  bay leaf 
 1 cup  beer , cold only 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a pan. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes; cool. Pour mixture over steaks. 
 Let stand 1 to 2 hours, turning steaks occasionally. 
 Barbecue until golden brown on both sides. Serve warm and plain over rice or with other main dishes but take the cooked steak out of the barbecue grill with tongs and transfer it to a large plate.
