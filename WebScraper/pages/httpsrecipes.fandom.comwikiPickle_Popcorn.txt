Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup popcorn unpopped 
 pickle juice out of a pickle jar 
 1 1/2 tsp dill 
 1/2 tsp garlic powder 
 1/2 tsp onion powder 
 1 tsp salt 
 Instructions : 
 Place dill, garlic powder, onion powder and salt in a small bowl and mix well.  
 Pour pickle juice into a spray bottle.  
 Air pop your popcorn. For more info on air poppers, see the Notes from the Chef section.  
 Spritz the popped popcorn with pickle juice and sprinkle the seasoning over it. Do this quickly- if the liquid dries, the spices will not stick to the popcorn.
