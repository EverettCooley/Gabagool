Ingredients : 
 125 g / 4 oz well-soaked  dried figs 
 125 g / 4 oz stoned  raisins 
 275 ml / 10 fl oz / 1¼ cups  red wine  (not too dry) 
 good pinch of ground  black pepper 
 ⅓ teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 ⅛ teaspoon ground  cloves 
 soft  dark brown sugar  to taste 
 3 teaspoons  rice flour   or   cornflour 
 a drop or two of red  food colouring 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Drain the  figs , reserving the soaking liquid. 
 Discard the stalk ends of the fruit and put them in a saucepan with the  raisins  and wine. 
 Add the spices and a teaspoon of  sugar  and bring to the boil. 
 Take off the heat and cool slightly, then turn the mixture into an electric blender and process until smooth. 
 Add a little of the soaking  water  if the mixture is stubbornly solid. 
 Cream the  rice flour  or  cornflour  with a little more soaking  water  or wine and brighten the tint with a drop of food colouring. 
 Blend the "cream" into the dried-fruit purée. 
 Then return the whole mixture to the saucepan and simmer until it thickens slightly. 
 Season with  salt  and a little extra  sugar  if you wish. 
 The mixture can be served hot or cold over a sweet cereal dish, firm stewed fruit or - best of all - ice cream. 
 Some versions in other manuscripts are stiffer and make a good filling for tartlets or fried puffs. 
 One encloses the filling in pastry to make dumplings.
