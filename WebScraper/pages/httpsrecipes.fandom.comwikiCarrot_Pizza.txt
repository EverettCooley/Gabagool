INGREDIENTS Â 
 
 10 ounces Pizza Dough
 
 3 ounces Onions sliced
 
 1 teaspoon Olive Oil
 
 1 1/2 ounces Red Pizza Sauce
 
 2 ounces Dry Mozzarella shredded
 
 2 ounces Swiss Cheese (2 deli slices) torn
 
 2 ounces Carrot (medium) sliced
 
 Balsamic Vinegar drizzle
 
 INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 Place your pizza stone or steel in your oven on a rack approximately 8 inches from the top broiler. Preheat your oven at the highest temperature (usually around 500 degree Fahrenheit) for 1 hour.
 
 Meanwhile in a heavy pan, over med-high heat the olive oil. Add onions and stirring occasionally, depending on your stove heat and the pan thickness you may want to turn the heat down. After 10 minutes sprinkle the onions with salt and stir. Continue cooking for 40 to 50 minutes as the onions brown but keep an eye to prevent burning the onions.
 
 Take your ball of dough and dust with flour. Dust your hands and the work area generously with flour. Press the dough down and gently stretch until it measures about 8 inches. Now carefully continue to stretch the dough until it measures about 12 inches. Move the dough carefully on to the floured peel.
 
 Evenly distribute the pizza sauce over the dough surface.
 
 Cover with mozzarella and Swiss cheese.
 
 Distribute the caramelized onions and carrots around the pizza.
 
 Carefully transfer the pizza from the peel to the baking stone. Bake for 12 minutes. Oven times will vary based on how high your oven can go and what type of stone or steel you are using, so keep an eye on your pizza.
 
 Transfer the pizza to a cutting surface. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over the pizza surface. Slice and serve.
