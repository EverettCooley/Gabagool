 Ingredients : 
 3 whole lotus leaves, rehydrated 
 12 fresh or dried shiitake  Mushrooms 
 11/2 cups raw glutinous (sticky)  rice 
 2 cups sliced  bamboo shoots 
 1 2/3 cups warm  water 
 1 Tbs. low-sodium soy sauce 
 2 tsp.  salt 
 1 tsp. freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 1. Soak lotus leaves in  water  for 20 minutes. Soak dried shiitake  Mushrooms , if using, in boiling  water  for 30 minutes to reconstitute, and cut into thin strips when soft. Alternatively, wash fresh shiitake  Mushrooms , and cut into thin strips.
 2. Rinse  rice  in warm  water  in a large bowl 3 or 4 times, or until  water  runs clear. Steam  rice  until tender, for about 30 minutes.
 3. Mix  Mushrooms ,  bamboo shoots , 12/3 cups  water , soy sauce,  salt  and  black pepper  thoroughly into  rice . Add  sesame oil  to mixture, but do not stir, as  oil  will permeate mixture.
 4. Meanwhile, use a clean dishcloth or paper towel to wipe off soaked lotus leaves. Cut each of the leaves into 4 small pieces, and place flat on work surface.
 5. Divide cooked  rice  mixture into 12 equal portions. Make rolls by placing  rice  mixture on one end of leaf. Fold sides in over filling, tucking leaf in tightly and rolling carefully. Tuck ends underneath.
 6. Place rolls in a steamer, and steam for 10 minutes, or until heated through. Remove from steamer, and serve.
