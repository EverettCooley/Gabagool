 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 lb Maria cookies (if you can't find them in Latino markets, try Graham Crackers) 
 4  egg  yolks 
 8 Tbsp  Sugar 
 1/2 lb  unsalted butter 
 1 cup of  Brazil nuts  crushed into large pieces 
 3 Tbsp of  port wine  or  Cointreau 
 4 Tbsp of Nestlé Quick 
 1 Tbsp of  dark chocolate 
 1 teaspoon of Nescafé 
 aluminum foil and plastic wrap 
 Directions : 
 Melt  butter  and let cool. In a mixer, beat  egg  yolks and  Sugar  until they double in volume. Mix in  butter . 
 Mix Nestlé Quick, Nescafé and  dark chocolate  with a drop of  water  or two and add to the  egg  and  Sugar  mixture. Add  Liquor . Remove from mixer and add  Brazil nuts . Crumble cookies into large pieces and add to mixture. 
 Spread mixture open on a piece of plastic wrap and put it in the freezer, uncovered, for 1/2 hour. 
 Remove from freezer and place on a clean kitchen towel. Roll it up until "salami" is formed - see photo above - and wrap it in a large piece of aluminum foil, longer than the "salami" so you'll be able to twist foil at both ends. Freeze for one day or overnight. Transfer to refrigerator until ready to use. 
 Open "salami" at one end and use a large kitchen knife to cut it into thick slices.
