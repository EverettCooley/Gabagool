 Yield: 16 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅔ cup  all-purpose flour 
 ½ cup Dutch-process  cocoa 
 2 tsp instant  espresso  powder 
 ¼ tsp  baking soda 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 2 oz  bittersweet chocolate , finely chopped 
 2 tbsp  canola oil 
 ⅓ cup unsweetened  applesauce 
 ¼ cup firmly packed  dark brown sugar 
 ¼ cup  granulated sugar 
 2 tbsp  dark corn syrup 
 2 tsp  vanilla extract 
 2  egg whites 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 
 Spray an 8x8-inch baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. 
 In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, espresso powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. 
 In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine the bittersweet chocolate and the oil; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is completely melted, about 2 minutes. 
 Remove from heat. 
 Stir in the applesauce, sugars, corn syrup, and vanilla; beat until smooth, about 1 minute. 
 Add the egg whites and continue beating until the sugar is dissolved, 1 minute more. 
 Add the reserved flour mixture and stir gently until smooth, about 2 minutes. 
 Spread evenly in the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out nearly clean, with a few fudgy crumbs, about 15 – 20 minutes. 
 Cool completely on a rack before cutting.
