 Ingredients : 
 14 oz. firm or extra  firm tofu 
 soy sauce (less sodium better for you!) 
 chili sauce  (I use Hunan) 
 lettuce  leaves (packaged or head works) 
 vegan Dijon  mustard  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Depending on how many people (half a package works for 2 people), slice the  tofu  into slabs and cut slabs in half. Then in a small dish, mix the soy sauce and hunan  chili sauce  together. This also is depending on how many people, but I usually end up with about a 1/4 cup of the mixture (you can always mix more if needed). Then soak the  tofu  in the sauce and then place on the grill (Forman grill works best, but pan cooking would probably work). Cook it for about 10-15 minutes, or until brown. Then place some Dijon on the  lettuce  leaves and place marinated  tofu  on top of that and wrap it!
