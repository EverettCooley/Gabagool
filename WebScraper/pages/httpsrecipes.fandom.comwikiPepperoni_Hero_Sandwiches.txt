Description : 
 A red-hot combination of a hero sandwich and the authentic pepperoni is a bold appetizer eaten on other occasions and is great for side dishes, as it often keeps a robust taste with the bread, peppers, and sausage.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  sweet onion , sliced fine 
 3 – 4 large  cubanelle / Sicilian peppers , seeded and sliced fine 
 4 links spicy Italian-style  soy "sausage" , sliced into pennies or rounds

 2  garlic  cloves, crushed 
 1 tbsp.  olive oil 
 coarse-ground  pepper , black or red only 
 salt  to taste 
 1 loaf of Baguette 
 2 tbsp.  red wine vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the sliced  onion  and  peppers  until soft, in  olive oil . 
 As they soften, add the  garlic , pepperoni, and  sausage , and toss often until both the sausage and pepperoni are well browned and the  peppers  are limp, adding more  olive oil  as needed. 
 Split the baguette in half lengthwise and toast briefly. 
 Sprinkle the insides with  olive oil  and  vinegar ,  salt  and  pepper ; fill with  peppers ,  onions  and  sausage .
