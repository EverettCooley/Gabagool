 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup  brown rice syrup 
 1/2 cup  sunflower oil 
 Equivalent of 2  eggs  in  egg  replacer (see "Substitutions" section of this website) 
 1 cup mashed, ripe  banana 
 1 tsp pure  vanilla 
 1 cup  whole wheat flour 
 1/2 cup  rolled oats 
 1/4 cup  cornmeal 
 1/4 cup  wheat germ 
 1 tsp alum-free  baking soda 
 1/4 tsp  sea salt  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Combine all wet ingredients together in a large measuring cup. Beat  egg  replacer with a whisk, then add wet ingredients to the  egg  replacer. 
 
 Combine all dry ingredients, then add to the wet mixture, alternating with the mashed  banana , so it is well-mixed.
 
 Preheat your oven to 350 F. Lightly  oil  muffin tins or loaf pan and fill with the batter.
 
 Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, until a toothpick comes out clean from the centre and top is browned.
 
 Try replacing the  whole wheat flour  with  oat flour  or other  flour  of your choice. Very tasty, although it may be a bit dryer.
