Directions : 
 Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn up in recipe collections throughout the beauce. A product of the giant Vachon bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers Arcade and Rose-Anna Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons Joseph and Louis and not, as some believe, after the heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Louis. Home recipes use a drop-cookie method and sometimes a  marshmallow  filling. 
 The baking cake is made automatically with a diameter of 3 Â½ inches (9cm). 
To achieve a symmetrical look and a light texture, the recipe is adapted from one belonging to Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des Pins to the muffin tin.
