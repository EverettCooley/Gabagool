 Description : 
 I like this recipe because it is so versatile. You can substitute the fruit of your choice, add freshly  grated coconut ,  nuts , etc. If I prepare this for a buffet, I just prepare the yogurt- cream  mixture and serve it on the table surrounded by bowls of different tropical fruit (or you can use any fruit..doesn't have to be tropical). This way, your guests can choose the fruits they prefer and make up their own bowl of fruit and  cream . 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  heavy cream 
 1 cup whole  milk   yogurt 
 1/3 cup  brown sugar 
 2 cups of ripe mangoes, peeled and cubed 
 fruit, of your choice (optional) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 The day before serving,  cream  together the  yogurt  and the  cream  until it is fairly thick but not stiff. 
 Put the mixure into an 8" shallow dish and sprinkle with the  brown sugar , cover and refrigerate. 
 Let sit for 24 hours. 
 On the day that you are serving it, let it sit on the counter until it comes to room temperature. 
 Put diced  mango  on top and serve.
