 About Jute leaf : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Jute Leaf on Wikipedia 
 Corchorus is a genus of about 40-100 species of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. Different common names are used in different contexts, with Jute applying to the fibre produced from the plant, and Melokhia (alternatively spelled Molokhiya, Molohiya, Mulukhiyah, Molehiya or Molocheiya; Arabic: ملوخية) applied to the leaves used as a vegetable. Other names include Bush Okra, Nalta jute, Jute Mallow, and Jew's Mallow.
 They are tall, usually annual herbs, reaching a height of 2-4 m, unbranched or with only a few side branches. The leaves are alternate, simple, lanceolate, 5-15 cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are small (2-3 cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the fruit is a many-seeded capsule.
