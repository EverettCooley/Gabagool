Info 
 Cook Time : 
 Serves : 8
 
 Ingredients 
 1 cup  wild rice 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1/2 cup  walnuts 
 8 ounces  cranberries , fresh or thawed frozen 
 1/2 cup  sugar 
 2 tablespoon  vegetable  or  olive oil 
 1 tablespoon  rice vinegar 
 3  green onions , chopped (including green tops) 
 Directions 
 1.Combine wild rice, salt and 1 qt water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until rice is tender to bite and most grains have split open, 45 to 60 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool. 
2.Meanwhile, spread walnuts on a cookie sheet and toast in a 325 degree oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Coarsely chop. 
3.Sort cranberries, discarding any stems and bruised or decayed fruit; cut each cranberry in half. 
4.In a saucepan over medium-high heat, stir the sugar and 1/2 cup water until the sugar is dissolved and mixture boils. Remove from heat; stir the halved cranberries. Gently stir occasionally until insides of cranberries have turned red but are still firm, 8 to 12 minutes. Pour through a strainer into a bowl, reserving the cranberry-sugar syrup. 
5.In a large bowl gently mix wild rice, cranberry halves, oil, and vinegar. Stir in 2 tablespoons cranberry syrup; taste and add up to 1/4 cup more syrup to sweeten and moisten salad as desired. Stir in green onions. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. 
6.Stir in walnuts before serving.
