Ingredients : 
 Large fresh or dried  green beans  (Called Habas – could substitute butter beans) 
 1 cup chopped white  Onion 
 1 and ½ cup chopped  carrot 
 ¼ cup chopped  salt   Pork 
 20 halved  new potatoes 
 1 cup twistie noodles 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 2 dried Aji Arequipina or whole dried  hot pepper  substitute 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Boil  potatoes  & beans until lightly cooked, separate from cooking  water  and set aside. 
 Combine, beans,  Onion ,  carrot ,  salt   Pork , and  salt  in large soup pot and simmer. 
 In separate frying pan lightly sautee noodle in  olive oil  until slightly browned in some parts and add to soup pot to simmer. This action enforces a kind of strong al-dente result when the noodles are later boiled. Grind Aji with a bit of tomatoe for moisture into a fine paste and add to soup pot. 
 Simmer in soup pot until  Pasta  is almost cooked, add  potatoes  and continue to simmer until  Pasta  and  potatoes  are both cooked. 
 This soup was a wonderful treat in the evening when temperatures plunged and the skies sparkeled in the thin mountain air. 
 I cannot fail to mention that the taste of this soup is aided by being cooked on an open wood flame – the rich smoke combines with the  salt   Pork  to produce much of its savoury flavor.
