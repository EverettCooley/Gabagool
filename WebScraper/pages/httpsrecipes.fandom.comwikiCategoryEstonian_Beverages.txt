 The Estonian beverages are served along with the traditional dishes. The alcoholic drinks resume to wines, ales and beers, while those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks can choose Kali. This is the name given to a beer that did not undergo the process of fermentation. In the Northern regions of the country, the light malt ale is famous, while in the Southern parts, the first option is light ale made from barley and rye. Birch sap is the name of another popular Estonian beverage.
