Ingredients : 
 3 large, fully ripe  avocados 
 caster sugar  to taste 
 1 cup  cream 
 dash of  rum , optional 
 Directions : 
 Cut  avocados  in halves lengthways, remove seeds and reserve. Scoop pulp from shells and mash smoothly with a fork. Add  Sugar  to taste and stir in the  cream . Put into serving bowl, return seeds to the pulp, cover closely with plastic wrap and chill before serving.The presence of the seeds in the pur√©e is said to keep the  avocado  from discolouring, but make sure that the surface is protected from air by putting the plastic on the surface of the mixture. 
 If you like, extra whipped and sweetened  cream  can be piped over the top of the dessert and a few paper.thin slices of  avocado  (sliced at the last moment and sprinkled with  lemon juice ) used for decoration. Note: While some favour  rum  for flavouring, I prefer to let the delicate  avocado  flavour stand alone.
