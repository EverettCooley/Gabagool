 1 frozen  pie crust  (most are vegan) 
 ¾ cup slivered blanched  almonds 
 ⅓ cup  sugar 
 3 tablespoons  amaretto 
 2 tablespoons (¼ stick) soy  margarine

 4 – 5 ripe  peaches 
 ½ cup  peach  or  apricot preserves 
 Directions : 
 Pre-bake pie crust according to package directions.

 Add remaining 1 tablespoon  flour ,  sugar , 2 tablespoons  amaretto  and soy marg and puree.

 Pour into crust. 
 Bake until filling begins to brown and is springy to touch, about 15 minutes. 
 Cool on rack (can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature). 
 If your  peaches  are very ripe, you can skip this part, but if not, it helps to blanch them first to easily remove the skins. 
 To do this, bring medium pot of  water  to boil. 
 Add  peaches  and blanch 30 seconds. 
 Transfer to bowl of cold  water , using slotted spoon. 
 Peel  peaches . 
 Cut into slices. 
 Drain well. 
 Combine preserves and 1 tablespoon  amaretto  in heavy small saucepan. 
 Bring to boil, stirring to melt preserves. 
 Boil until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. 
 Brush some preserves over tart filling. 
 Arrange  peaches  atop preserves in concentric circles, overlapping slices. 
 Brush with remaining preserves. 
 Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. 
 Store at room temperature.
