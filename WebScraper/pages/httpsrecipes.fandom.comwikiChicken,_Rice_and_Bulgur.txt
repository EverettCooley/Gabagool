Description : 
 This hearty casserole goes together quickly. The bulgur wheat gives it a nutty flavor, but pearl barley may also be used for a creamier dish, or use your favorite grain.  Using two types of rice would also work.  You may need to adjust the amount of broth and/or the cooking time.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs.  chicken  -- split breasts or boneless thighs work best 
 1/2 c.  rice 
 1/2 c.  bulgur 
 1 c. diced  onion 
 1 c. diced  carrot 
 1/2 c. diced  celery 
 2 c.  chicken broth 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 onion powder ,  garlic powder , and  paprika  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a large microwave-safe casserole with a lid, mix rice and bulgur in an even layer 
 Spread diced vegetables over rice. 
 Place chicken on vegetables.  If using split breasts, place with meaty side down. 
 Sprinkle meat with salt, pepper, and spices to taste 
 Poor broth over all 
 Cover and microwave on high for 5 minutes; reduce power to medium and cook for an additional 40 minutes. 
 Remove from oven, and shred or cut meat, removing bones. 
 Mix well before serving. 
 Notes : 
 This recipe is from the 80s, which is why it is cooked in the microwave.  If you wish to use a traditional oven, heat the broth to boiling before adding it.  Then place in a 375 F oven for about 1 hr (or until fully cooked).
