 Description : 
       Mississippi Mud Pie     
 There was (note the word was, unfortunately) a Cajun restaurant here. We went there very often and got friendly with the owner/cook. When they decided to go into another business I managed to get his Mississippi Mud Pie recipe. Had eaten it there so many times he probably felt sorry for me not to be able to taste it again. I love it! In the midst of all the "Mud" pies here I still hope you'll want to try it.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Crumb crust base : 
 4 ounces digestive biscuits, crushed 
 2 ounces  butter , melted 
 1 ounce  sugar 
 Filling : 
 14 ounces plain  dark chocolate 
 8 ounces  butter 
 2 tablespoons instant  coffee 
 2 tablespoons boiling  water 
 1¼ cups  cream 
 1½ cups  brown sugar 
 6  eggs 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 375°F. 
 Lightly grease an 8-inch spring-form. 
 Mix together the crushed digestive biscuits, the melted  butter  and the  sugar  and spoon into the prepared tin. 
 Level the biscuit mixture out evenly, using the back of a metal spoon. 
 For the filling, measure the  chocolate ,  butter , instant  coffee  and  water  into a large pan and heat gently until the  butter  and  chocolate  have melted. 
 Remove from the heat, and beat in the  cream ,  sugar  and  eggs  and then pour the mixture on to the biscuit crust.
