 About chicharrón : 
 Chicharrón is a dish made of fried pork rinds. It is sometimes made from chicken, mutton, or beef.
 Chicharrón is popular in Andalucia, Spain, and in Latin America is part of the traditional cuisines of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil (where it is called torresmo), Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and others. The singular form, chicharrón, is also used as a mass noun, especially in Filipino, where words do not have a pluralized form. They are usually made with different cuts of pork, but sometimes made with mutton, or with beef in Argentina. In Costa Rica, they are usually made from pork ribs or similar cuts; rinds are rarely used.
