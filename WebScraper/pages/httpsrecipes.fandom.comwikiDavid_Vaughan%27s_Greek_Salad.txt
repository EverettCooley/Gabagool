Description : 
 They say that this is served on the Island of Crete as a main dish in the middle of the table and everyone eats out of the same dish, when the salad gets down to the end, everyone fights to sop up the  olive oil  and  feta  with a thick heavy bread that they serve in Greece. It is so good with the  olive oil  and  feta  on it.

 Slice the Bermuda (red)  onion  in half and then cut across in thin slices, kind of separate. 
 Peel the  European cucumbers  and cut in half or quarters before cutting across to make thick slices. 
 Now layer,  cucumbers ,  tomatoes ,  onion , salting in between  cucumbers  and  tomatoes , and then layering again.
