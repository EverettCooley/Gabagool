 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 4 large  carrots 
 4 ounces of  orange   Lentils 
 1 large  Onion 
 2 large  tomatoes 
 2 pints of  vegetable stock . 
 Directions : 
 Chop the  Onion  into medium size pieces and place into a saucepan. Use non stick 
 Fry the  onions  until they are soft and translucent then add the  carrots 
 Add all the stock and bring to the boil. 
 Turn the heat down to a simmer and add the  Lentils , cover with a lid and leave to simmer for 15 minutes. 
 The  Lentils  will go soft and absorb most of the liquid. 
 Blend the soup in the saucepan with a hand blender and then 
 add any extra liquid (either  water  or stock) to the thickness you want. 
 Add the tin of  tomatoes  and carry on blending until you have a smooth  orange  soup. 
 The soup now is complete and should be brought back to the boil for a few moments to ensure the  tomatoes  are heated through. 
 
 Add any extra flavourings that you may like such as  garlic  or herbs but do taste the soup beforehand 
 To garnish you could add  chives  that is optional. 
 
 Serve with your favourite bread
