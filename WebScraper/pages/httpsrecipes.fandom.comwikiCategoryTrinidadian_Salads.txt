 Salads are considered in Trinidad Tobago to be very healthy because of the great contribution of proteins and vitamins found in fruits and vegetables. Salads get to be served as a main dish or as snack or even as desserts. Because of the great complexity of the cuisine, this country always seems to find new methods of combining fruits and vegetables in unique dishes. Another feature of the salads from Trinidad Tobago is that they may be cooked using meat or seafood. Shrimp salad is made with mayonnaise, mustard, tomato ketchup, curry powder, pineapple pieces or mixed fruits, sliced canned mushrooms and lemon slices or juice. Some other ingredient used to enhance the taste of the fish is salt, pepper and 1 cap of Rum.
