 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  Spelt  or  whole wheat flour 
 1 cup  rolled oats  ( oatmeal ), ground 
 1/4 tsp.  nutmeg , ground 
 1 cup  Raisins 
 2  bananas , medium size 
 1/2 cup  dates , pitted 
 1/2 cup  apple juice 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 350 °F. (175 °C.) 
 Place the  Spelt , or  whole wheat flour , and the ground  rolled oats  ( oatmeal ) in a bowl and mix together. (The  rolled oats  can be ground in a blender on high speed. Be sure that the container is dry before grinding.) Add the  nutmeg  and mix well. Add the  Raisins  and mix well to ensure that the  Raisins  are not sticking together, and that they are thoroughly coated with the  flour  mixture. 
 Place the  apple juice ,  bananas  and  dates  in the container of a high speed blender. Cover and run at high speed until all the ingredients are thoroughly blended and smooth. 
 Add about 3/4 of the banana-date mixture to the  flour  mixture and mix thoroughly with a stiff spatula or spoon. Gradually add a little more of the liquid mixture until desired consistency is reached. If the cookie dough is too stiff after adding all the liquid mixture, you may add more  apple juice . A thinner dough will make a flatter cookie. A stiff dough will make irregular thick cookies like the ones shown in the photo. (To test for dough stiffness, we stick a soup spoon upright into the dough. If the dough is stiff enough, the spoon will remain upright.) 
 On a non-stick or lightly oiled baking sheet, place the cookie dough in twelve equal sized "mounds." Smooth and shape each cookie with a spoon or spatula, as desired. 
 Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Various ovens bake differently, so we suggest that you begin checking the cookies after 20 minutes of baking. The cookies should be firm, but not hard. Be careful not to over-bake. When the  banana   Raisin  cookies are baked, remove from the oven, cool, and enjoy.
