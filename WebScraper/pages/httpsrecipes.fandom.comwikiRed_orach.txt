 About Red orach : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Red Orach on Wikipedia 
 Atriplex is a plant genus of 100-200 species, known by the common names of saltbush and orache (or orach). The genus is quite variable and widely distributed. The genus includes many desert and seashore plants and halophytes, as well as plants of moist environments. Saltbushes are extremely tolerant of salt content in the ground: their name derives from the fact that they retain salt in their leaves, which makes them of great use in areas affected by soil salination. Many species are edible. However, the favored species for human consumption is A. hortensis.
 The Garden Orache (A. hortensis), also called red orach, mountain spinach or French spinach, is an annual leaf vegetable with a salty, spinach-like taste. The plant grows 1-2 m (3-6 ft) in height and the leaves are used cooked or in salads. It was commonly grown in Mediterranean regions from early times until spinach became the more favored leaf vegetable of choice. The leaves can come in red, white and green leaves. The green leaves were once used to color pasta in Italy. Another common use of orach was to mix with the herb sorrel to balance out its acid flavor.
 The plant is also used as an ornamental plant in landscaping.
 Atriplex species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species - see list of Lepidoptera which feed on Atriplex.
