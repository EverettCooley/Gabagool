Description : 
 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 800 g [1Â lb 9 oz] boar meat 
 80 g [3 oz] diced pancetta (cured  Pork  meat similar to unsmoked  Bacon ) 
 50 g [2 oz]  butter 
 1.5 l [3 pt]  red wine 
 1 cup dry  white wine 
 1 cup stock 
 3 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 sticks  celery 
 1  carrot 
 1  Onion 
 1 bunch mixed herbs (such as  parsley   basil   sage   oregano ) 
 peel of 1/2  lemon 
 1 tbsp  flour 
 3 peppercorns 
 salt 
 freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Mix together the  red wine , finely sliced  Onion ,  celery  and peppercorns and marinate the meat for 48 hours; drain and dry. 
 Make a few incisions in the meat with the point of a knife and insert the prosciutto after coating it with  pepper . 
 Heat the  oil  and 30 g [1 oz]  butter  in a large pan and brown the meat for 4 minutes. 
 Moisten with the  white wine  and allow to evaporate. 
 Add the bunch of mixed herbs (tie it up to prevent the herbs from dispersing into the sauce) the  lemon peel  (sliced),  salt , freshly ground  pepper  and stock, then cook, covered, over a low heat for about 3 hours, adding warm  water  if necessary. 
 Transfer the cooked meat to a serving dish; stir the remaining  butter  together with the  flour  into the pan juices and cook for a few minutes before pouring over the meat. 
 Since boar meat is not always readily available,  Pork  may be used instead, in which case marinating time should be reduced by at least 12 hours.
