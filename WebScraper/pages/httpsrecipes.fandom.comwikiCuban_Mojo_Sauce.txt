Description : 
 The authentic mojo is made with juice from  sour oranges . It still has that little orangy taste, but its very acid and tart. You can come close by mixing equal amounts of freshly squeezed  orange juice  with  lime juice  (*). If you live in areas with large concentration of Latinos you will probably find bottled Mojo (Goya brand makes one) or their produce department might have the slightly bumpy, thick skinned  sour oranges . This recipe makes one cup.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  olive oil 
 6 to 8 cloves  garlic , thinly sliced or minced 
 ⅔ cup  sour orange juice  or  lime juice  (or equal portions  OJ  and  lime juice ) 
 ½ tsp ground  cumin 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper , to taste 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  olive oil  in a deep saucepan over medium heat. 
 Add the  garlic  and cook until fragrant and lightly toasted. 
 Don't let it brown or it will be acrid tasting, just about 30 seconds should do it. 
 Add the  sour orange juice ,  cumin  and  salt  and  pepper .  Stand back ; the sauce may sputter. 
 Bring to a rolling boil. 
 Taste and correct seasoning, if needed. 
 Cool before serving. 
 Mojo is best when served within a couple of hours of making, but it will keep for several days, well capped in a jar or bottle, in the refrigerator. 
 Use with Cuban sandwiches, boiled yuca, grilled seafood and meats, fried green  plantain  chips, etc.
