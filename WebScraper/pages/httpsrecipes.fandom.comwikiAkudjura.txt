As part of the Australian Promotion at the Sheraton Grande Laguna Phuket in November, we created this dish to highlight the flavours of Oz Lemon and Akudjura (Bush Tomato). The filling for the pasta is simple, its basically cream cheese, poached English spinach, salt and Alpine Pepper. Be sure to completely dry off the spinach. You can use any regular pasta dough for the ravioli.
