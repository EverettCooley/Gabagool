 3 large  Gala apples , peeled and cored 
 3 tablespoons golden  raisins 
 3 tablespoons  flour

 Directions : 
 Grate apples into a bowl. Add golden raisins, flour, egg, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Mix well. 
 Brush a large griddle or skillet with oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. 
 Drop as many tablespoons of apple mixture onto a griddle as possible to fit, leaving enough space between each one. Flatten with a spatula into ¼-inch-thick pancakes. 
 Cook latkes for a few minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through. 
 Serve with a dollop of Greek Yogurt or sour cream.
