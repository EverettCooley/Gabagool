Description : 
 6 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 300 g [10 oz]  flour 
 100 g [3 x 1 oz] very fine dry  breadcrumbs 
 120 g [4 oz] grated  Parmigiano Reggiano 
 70 g [2 x 1 oz] roast lean boned  pork  in one piece 
 70 g [2 x 1 oz] roast lean boned  veal  in one piece 
 70 g [2 x 1 oz] boiled lean  beef  in one piece 
 50 g [2 oz]  prosciutto  (cured  ham ) 
 4  eggs 
 1.5 l [scant 3 pt] meat  stock 
 1 pinch  nutmeg 
 salt 
 freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Mince [grind] all the meats, place in a bowl with the breadcrumbs and combine well. 
 Finely chop the prosciutto and add to the meat mixture together with the grated  cheese  and 1  egg . 
 Mix until compact but still soft then season with  salt  and  pepper  and flavour with  nutmeg . 
 Next make the  pasta : put the  flour  in a mound on a pastry board or work surface, make a well in the centre and break in the 3 remaining  eggs . 
 Combine to a firm, homogenous dough and roll out into a fairly thin sheet. 
 Put little balls of the filling at regular intervals on one half and cover with the other half. 
 Press down with the fingers between each little mound of filling, cut into little squares about 6 cm by 6 cm [2½ in by 2½ in] and fold in half diagonally to make a triangle, pressing the edges together well to seal. 
 Wrap the long side of each triangle around a finger until the two ends meet and overlap, press them gently together to make the characteristic "little hat" shape ("cappelletto"). 
 Cook in boiling broth and serve hot, sprinkled with grated  cheese .
