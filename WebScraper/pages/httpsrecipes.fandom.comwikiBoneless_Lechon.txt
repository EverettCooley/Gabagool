Description : 
Make this  lechon  recipe for special weekend treats. Its skin is ultra-crispy! This brined and baked pork belly is moist, and since it is boneless, it is easier to eat. Look at that crispy skin, too!       Boneless Lechon     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup salt 
 ¼ cup sugar, white only 
 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 
 4 cups cold water, divided 
 1 ⅔ kilo whole pork belly, bones removed 
 lechon  sauce 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan over medium heat, add salt, sugar, pepper, to 1 cup water. Stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. 
 Once dissolved, remove from heat and pour into a container (with a lid) that can hold the pork belly. Add remaining cold water. Set aside to cool completely. 
 Once cooled, place pork belly into the brine, ensuring that it is fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours, up to 72 hours (3 days). 
 Preheat an oven to 350° F. Remove pork from brine, and place on a roasting pan. Bake in the middle rack of the oven for 3 hours or until the skin is crispy and the meat is browned. 
 Remove from the oven, and let rest 10 minutes before carving with a sharp knife. Serve while hot with  lechon  sauce on the side, if desired.
