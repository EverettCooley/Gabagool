Ingredients : 
 1 pound (450 g, approximately) water-packed medium- firm tofu  (NOT silken) 
 ¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 ¼ cup pure  water 
 2 heaping tbsp yellow,  nutritional yeast  flakes (NOT  brewer's yeast ) 
 2 heaping tablespoons  yellow miso 
 2 tsp  Dijon mustard 
 1 tsp  turmeric  (for a yellow colour) 
 1 tsp  sage 
 ¼ tsp each dried  basil  and  oregano 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 1  onion , diced 
 ½  green pepper , diced 
 ½  red ,  yellow  or  orange pepper , diced 
 1 small  tomato , diced 
 1 or 2 cloves fresh  garlic , minced 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, mix the  tofu  with all the ingredients but the vegetables. Combine it thoroughly, until the  tofu  takes on a crumbled, scrambled- egg  type consistency. Allow this to marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour (overnight is best). 
 Once the  tofu  is finished marinating, heat a tablespoonful or less of extra virgin  olive oil  in a heavy bottomed skillet and sauté the veggies (except the  tomato ) until tender. Add the marinated  tofu  and cook over medium heat until all of the  water  is boiled off. Stir in the diced  tomato . 
 Serve with or over toast,  English muffins  or crumpets, or rolled up in  tortillas , or any way you might have scrambled  eggs , and enjoy!
