Ingredients : 
 8 oz  semisweet chocolate , chopped 
 1 lb  silken tofu , drained 
 ½ cup chocolate  soymilk 
 1 large  egg 
 ½ cup  brown sugar 
 ¼ cup  cocoa powder 
 1½ tbsp  all-purpose flour 
 2 tbsp  vanilla extract 
 ½ tsp instant  coffee  granules 
 4 large  egg whites 
 2 tbsp  granulated sugar 
 2 tbsp seedless  raspberry preserves 
 1 pint  raspberries  or sliced  strawberries  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 300 °F. Butter a 9-inch spring-form pan, and line bottom with parchment paper. Butter paper. 
 Melt  chocolate  in a small heavy saucepan over very low heat. Stir until smooth, remove from heat and set aside. 
 Combine melted  chocolate ,  tofu ,  chocolate   soymilk , whole  egg ,  brown sugar ,  cocoa ,  flour ,  vanilla  and  coffee  granules in a blender or food processor. Purée until blended and smooth. 
 Beat  egg  whites in a metal mixing bowl until stiff but not dry. Add  granulated sugar , and beat 1 minute more. Pour about one-third of the  chocolate / tofu  mixture onto the beaten whites, and mix gently. Mix in remaining  chocolate / tofu  mixture in two or three more batches. Pour cake batter into prepared spring-form pan. 
 Bake until slightly set around edges but still jiggly in center, for about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool on a wire rack. When cool, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. The  chocolate  flavor is richer the next day. 
 To serve, run a knife around cake edge, and gently remove outside of pan. Slide cake from pan bottom onto a cake plate. Spread  raspberry preserves  over top of cake. Cover with fresh fruit. Use a hot knife to slice, wiping knife between cuts.
