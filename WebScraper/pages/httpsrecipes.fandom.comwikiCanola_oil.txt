 About Canola oil : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Canola oil on Wikipedia 
 In agriculture, Canola is a trademarked cultivar of the rapeseed plant from which rapeseed oil is obtained. It was initially bred in Canada by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson in the 1970s.
 Canola oil is made from rape seeds and is also known as rapeseed oil or lear oil. Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than any other oil, has a high smoke point and its mild flavor makes it a good choice for salad dressings as well as cooking.
