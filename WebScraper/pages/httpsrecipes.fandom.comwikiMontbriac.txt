 About Montbriac : 
 Montbriac is a wonderful French blue gourmet cheese that is very different from many of the softer brie-blue combinations available.
 It is very striking on the cheese board with its soft, gooey texture, and blue veining outlined by the blue-gray color of the ash-covered rind.
 The flavor of this attractive gourmet cheese is creamy, complex and satisfying while being not too sharp or aggressive. It is delicious on crusty bread and fresh fruit.
