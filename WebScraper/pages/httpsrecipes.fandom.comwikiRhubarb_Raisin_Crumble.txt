Ingredients : 
 1½ lb  rhubarb  trimmed and cut into 1-inch slices 
 ¼ cup  strawberry preserves , sweetened 
 ¼ cup  raisins 
 ½ tbsp  orange zest , organic, finely minced or grated if possible 
 1 cup  granola , preferably maple walnut 
 maple syrup  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Combine ingredients in a heatproof pan 13x8x2 inches. 
 The combined ingredients will seem dry; don't be concerned; the  rhubarb  will give up considerable liquid as it cooks. 
 Place pan in a cold oven, set temperature to 375°F, and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. 
 Stir and continue baking until  rhubarb  is tender but still firm, about 10 to 15 minutes more. 
 Add  maple syrup  to taste if more sweetness is desired.
