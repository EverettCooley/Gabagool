Ingredients : 
 1  egg 
 3 to 4  egg  whites, depending on  egg  size 
 2 tsp  olive oil 
 1 small  Onion , halved and sliced 
 1/2 med green  bell pepper , sliced 
 1/2 med red  bell pepper , sliced 
 5 or 6  Mushrooms  (optional) 
 few  black olives , sliced (optional) 
 fresh chopped  basil  (optional) 
 1 to 2 cloves  garlic  (optional) 
 1 med  tomato , ripe, sliced into thin wedges and drained 
 1/2 cup reduced-fat shredded  Cheddar   Cheese 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Heat  oil  in a nonstick skillet on medium heat. 
 Add sliced  Onion  and  bell pepper  and saute for 3 or 4 minutes. 
 If using  Mushrooms ,  basil  and/or  garlic , add them now. (Spray  Mushrooms  briefly with  cooking spray .) Saute another minute or two. Don't allow the  garlic  to brown. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to  eggs  and stir. Don't completely combine. 
 Pour into the skillet over the veggies and continue to cook until set on the bottom. 
 To help the frittata release, you may wish to spray the sides of the pan above the omelet with more  cooking spray . 
 Lift the edges as they set, allowing raw  egg  to run underneath. When it won't run any more, be sure it is loose and will slide. 
 If the handle of your pan isn't oven-proof, you must slide the omelet out onto an oven proof platter. Otherwise leave it in the pan. 
 Arrange the  tomatoes  on top the omelet. Sprinkle with the  Cheese . 
 Place as far as possible from the flame of your broiler until the  Cheese  melts. Offer extra  black pepper  and serve with whole  Wheat  toast, or if the family is off and running, wrap a chunk up in a tortilla or stuff it in a pita.
