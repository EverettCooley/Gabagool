 Split peas are the dried peeled and split seeds of Pisum sativum. Generally in north India this is known as matar ki daal, sometimes used as a cheaper variation for the very popular chhole on stalls offering chhole. ( Tamil பருப்பு Pattani paruppu). They come in yellow and green varieties. The peas are round when harvested and dried. Once dry, the skin is removed and the natural split in the seed's cotyledon can be mechanically separated, in part to encourage faster cooking.
 Yellow split peas are sometimes confused with the Indian  toor dal  (split  pigeon peas ) or  chana dal  (split yellow gram, chickpeas or garbanzo beans); while all commonly known as peas the latter are from other legume species.
 They are a great source of protein.
