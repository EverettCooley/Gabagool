 About Breadfruit : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Breadfruit on Wikipedia 
 The Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), Malayalam: kada-chakkai, Hawaiian: â€˜ulu, Indonesian: sukun; is a tree and fruit native to the east Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean islands. It has also been widely planted in tropical regions elsewhere. It was first collected and distributed by Lieutenant William Bligh as one of the botanical samples collected by HMS Bounty in the late 18th century, on a quest for a cheap high-energy food source for British slaves in the West Indies.
 Breadfruit grows to a height of 20 m. The large and thick leaves are deeply cut into pinnate lobes. All parts of the tree yield latex, a milky juice. This latex is used for boat caulking.
