Wikipedia Article  About Chinese black vinegar on Wikipedia       Black Vinegar     
 Black rice vinegar is very popular in southern China. Chinkiang vinegar is considered the best of the black rice vinegars. Normally, the black rice vinegar is made with glutinous or sweet rice, although millet or sorghum may be used instead. It is dark in colour, and has a deep, almost smoky flavour that is somewhat similar to Worcestershire sauce.
