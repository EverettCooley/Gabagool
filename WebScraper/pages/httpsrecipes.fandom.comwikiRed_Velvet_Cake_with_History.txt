 Red velvet cake also known as the $100 dollar cake, $200 dollar cake, or Waldorph Astoria Cake is only a legend as is the Nieman Marcus cookies and all are examples of a legend that pits institutions against a consumer who feels he/she has been unfairly charged.The recipe is a grass roots recipe not an institutional one. 
 James Beard outlines in his American Cookery that there is really 3 varieties of red velvet cake, recipes being different in the use of  butter ,  vegetable shortening  ( crisco ) and  oil .Most all call for  cake flour  and  buttermilk ,  baking soda  and  vinegar  for the leaving process. The redness of the cake comes from red food color despite the chemical reaction of  baking soda ,  vinegar  ,  buttermilk  and  cocoa  which cause a reddish brown color, not red in the cake. 
 This cake is moist and red with a velvety texture and the flavor nondistinctive as is most red velvet cakes. Red Velvet cake is also cultural as recipes differ in community cookbooks accross America even as to the type of frosting for the cake. The moistest cake is one made with  oil  and  cake flour .The amount of food color is up to you.Start with 2 teaspoons as a base. The above recipe comes from:" Celebrating Our Mothers' Kitchen", a fundraising cookbook published by The National Council for Negro Woman.
