Description : 
       Cranachan     
 This recipe combines traditional Scottish produce to good effect, creating a mouthwatering dessert that is a delightful treat whenever fresh soft fruit is in season. Although this elegant desert is popular across Scotland, it is consumed in enormous quantities in the Loch Ness area and in the Northeast of Scotland where huge, fat, juicy  raspberries  abound in late summer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ounces  old-fashioned oatmeal 
 10 ounces fresh  double cream 
 3 tablespoons  honey 
 3 tablespoons good  scotch whiskey 
 12 ounces fresh  raspberries  (or other fresh soft fruit) 
 Directions : 
 Toast the  oatmeal  under a broiler, turning occasionally with a spoon or spatula, until it is golden brown. 
 Allow the  oatmeal  to cool. 
 Whip the  cream  until it is very stiff and then mix in the honey,  whisky  and  oatmeal . 
 Layer the  raspberries  with the  cream  mixture in four tall glasses, cover with Kling or Saran wrap and refrigerate. 
 Allow to come to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving and then decorate with a few  raspberries .
