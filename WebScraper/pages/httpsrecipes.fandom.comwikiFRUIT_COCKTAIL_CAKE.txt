FRUIT COCKTAIL CAKE
 Cake:
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups all purpose flour
1&1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 beaten eggs
1 undrained can (15 ounce, may be 14 1/2 ounce) fruit cocktail in 
heavy syrup 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 Glaze:
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13x9x2 inch baking pan; set 
aside. 
 In small bowl combine brown sugar and walnuts; set aside.
 In large bowl combine flour, the 1&1/2 cups granulated sugar and 
baking soda. In another bowl combine eggs, undrained fruit cocktail 
and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Add to flour mixture, stirring just 
until combined. Spread in prepared pan. Sprinkle with walnut mixture.
 Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes 
out clean.
 Meanwhile, in small saucepan combine the 1 cup of granulated sugar, 
evaporated milk, and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. 
Stir in the 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Slowly pour over warm 
cake. Cool completely. Better if let sit overnight.
 I sometimes double the glaze recipe.
