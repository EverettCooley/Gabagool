Description : 
 An international combination of ground beef, brown gravy, real vegetables, and soy sauce is made bolder in taste and cooked to fine perfection, as it delivers a white-hot aroma to the meat and adds some clear zing to the bean sprouts and rice. Onion paste often replaces the real onions and works for this, too.
