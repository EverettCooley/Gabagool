Bitterballen, bite-sized  veal  croquettes. These are usually eaten when Dutch people go to a bar and served with a drink. I quess you could call it Dutch 'Tapas' !
 
 Ingredients : 
 200 g  veal shoulder , cubed 
 1  bouquet garni 
 400 ml  beef stock 
 30 g  butter 
 30 g  flour 
 salt  and  pepper 
 nutmeg 
 2  eggs 
 100 g breadcrumbs 
 sunflower oil  (for frying) 
 French mustard 
 Directions : 
 In a pan put meat,  bouquet garni  and  beef stock  slowly to the boil and simmer for about 1 hour until meat is tender. 
 Strain off 200 ml stock into a measuring jug. 
 Slice the cooked meat very thinly. 
 Melt the  butter  in a pan and stir in the  flour . 
 Add the stock, while stirring, and continue stirring until the sauce is thick and smooth. 
 Leave the sauce to cook gently for about 2 minutes. 
 Stir in the meat and add  salt ,  pepper  and  nutmeg  to taste. 
 Pour the ragout onto a flat plate and refrigerate until firm. (Best to make this one day in advance) 
 In a deep plate beat the  eggs  with one tablespoon of  water . 
 Shape the ragout into 24 balls (Little bit smaller than golfball) and roll in the breadcrumbs. 
 Then roll in the beaten  eggs  and breadcrumbs again. 
 Repeat until well coated. 
 Heat  oil  in a deep fat fryer to 180°C. 
 Deep fry croquettes 6 at the time for 3 – 4 minutes until brown and crisp. 
 Drain on paper towel. 
 Serve the warm bitterballen on a plate with a serving of  mustard  next to it.
