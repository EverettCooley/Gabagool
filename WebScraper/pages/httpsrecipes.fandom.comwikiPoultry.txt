      Poultry     
 Poultry  is the category of domesticated birds that people keep for the purpose of collecting their eggs, or killing for their meat and/or feathers. These most typically are members of the superorder  Galloanserae  (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes  chickens ,  quails  and  turkeys ) and the family  Anatidae  (in order Anseriformes), commonly known as "waterfowl" (e.g. domestic  ducks  and domestic  geese ). Poultry also include other birds which are killed for their meat, such as  pigeons or doves  or birds considered to be game, like  pheasants . The term also refers to the flesh of such birds.
