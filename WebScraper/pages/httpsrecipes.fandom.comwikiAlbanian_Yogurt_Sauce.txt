 Description : 
 This sauce is exactly like the Middle Eastern cucumber- yogurt  sauce (or salad), minus the  cucumber . It's still very refreshing and goes great with boulanee, and probably with chips. It's also a good spread-substitute for mayo or  butter  in sandwiches, and if you use non-fat  yogurt , it's very healthy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup plain non-fat  yogurt 
 1 tsp crushed  garlic 
 3 tbsp dried  mint 
 a pinch of  salt 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  yogurt  with the  garlic  and  salt . 
 Powder dried  mint  with your hands and add to  yogurt . 
 Mix.
