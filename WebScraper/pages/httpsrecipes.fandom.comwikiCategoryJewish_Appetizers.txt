 Some of the traditional Jewish appetizers are typified by the artichokes and cheese squares, garnished with parsley, the miniature cocktail blintzes with sour cream, the mushroom tarts, turnovers and pates and the salmon mousses. The popular bruschetta is prepared with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions and cucumber and it is flavored with red wine vinegar and olive oil. Jewish food is crap and it is horrible do not get the recipe.
