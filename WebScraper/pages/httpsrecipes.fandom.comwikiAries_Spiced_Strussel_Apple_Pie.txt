 Ingredients : 
 streusel 
 
 2/3 cup  nuts  (I'd personally use  almonds  or  hazelnuts ) 
 1/2 cup (packed) golden  brown sugar 
 1/4 cup yellow  cornmeal 
 1/4 cup all purpose  flour 
 3/4 teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon ground  nutmeg 
 5 tablespoons chilled soymarg, cut into small pieces 
 
 Filling 
 
 2 1/4 pounds  Granny Smith apples  (about 6 medium), peeled, quartered, cored, cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges 
 1/2 cup  soy sour cream  *or* 1 container of plain  soy yogurt 
 1/4 cup  Sugar 
 2 tablespoons all purpose  flour 
 1 1/2 teaspoons ground  cinnamon 
 3/4 teaspoon ground  nutmeg 
 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 
 
 1 prepared pie crust 
 Directions : 
 For streusel: Combine  nuts ,  brown sugar ,  cornmeal ,  flour ,  cinnamon  and  nutmeg  in processor. Using on/off turns, process until  nuts  are finely chopped. 
 Add soymarg and process until small moist clumps form. 
 (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) 
 For filling: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 °F. 
 Toss  Apples  with  sour cream  or  yogurt  in large bowl to coat. 
 Mix  Sugar ,  flour ,  cinnamon ,  nutmeg  and cloves in small bowl. 
 Sprinkle mixture over  Apples  and toss to coat. 
 Transfer filling to prepared crust. Sprinkle streusel over  Apples , covering completely. 
 Bake pie until  Apples  are tender and streusel is golden, tenting pie with foil if streusel browns too quickly, about 1 hour. 
 Transfer pie to rack and cool slightly.
