 Meanwhile, prepare the  okra  as directed in the note above. 
 In a saute pan over medium heat, warm the remaining ½ tablespoon (per serving) of  butter  or  oil  Add the  okra  and saute for 3 mins, stirring gently. 
 Remove the stew from the oven and arrange the  okra  on top in a spoke pattern. Sprinkle the  lemon juice  evenly over the surface. Re-cover the dish and return it to the oven. 
 Bake for 50 minutes longer. Add stock or  water  if the mixture seems too dry. 
 Serve the "bumya" stew piping hot.
