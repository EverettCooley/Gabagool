 Baklava Rolls
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ lb  walnuts , finely chopped 
 2½ tbsp  sugar 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon 
 ⅛ tsp ground  cloves 
 1 lb  phyllo dough 
 ¾ lb  unsalted butter , melted 
 Syrup : 
 1½ cup  water 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 2 tsp  lemon juice 
 ½ cup  honey 
 Directions : 
 Heat oven to 350°F. 
 Mix first four ingredients together for filling. 
 Combine syrup ingredients and cook until  sugar  dissolves and mixture turns syrupy. 
 Set aside to cool. Remove  cinnamon  stick before using. 
 Unfold  phyllo . 
 Using a sharp knife, carefully cut  phyllo  sheets crosswise, into thirds. 
 Cover  phyllo  not being used with a barely damp towel. 
 Using two pieces of  phyllo  -  phyllo  sheets are so thin they must be doubled - and keeping narrow ends towards you, brush with  butter . 
 Place 1 to 1½ teaspoons filling ¼ inch from end nearest you, to within ¼ inch of sides. Fold long sides in ¼ inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling. 
 Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like cylinder. 
 Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. 
 Place roll on cookie sheet and generously brush with  butter . Repeat with remaining filling and  phyllo . 
 Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. 
 Dip hot rolls into cooled syrup - kitchen tongs work well for this. 
 Place onto a platter to cool. Cover and refrigerate. 
 Can be frozen.
