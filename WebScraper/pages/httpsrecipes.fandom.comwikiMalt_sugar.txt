 Wikipedia Article  About Malt sugar on Wikipedia 
 Maltose (also: malt sugar, di-glucose) is a disaccharide with the molecular formula C 12 H 22 O 11 . Its systematic name is α-D-Glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-D-Glucopyranose.
 Like other carbohydrates, maltose has a hydrogen to oxygen ratio of 2:1. It consists of two α-glucose molecules joined by a glycosidic bond between carbon atom 1 of the first glucose unit and carbon atom 4 of the second glucose unit. The second glucose unit is reducing, however the first one is not because the reducing group is part of the glycosidic bond.
 Maltose is the second member of an important biochemical series of glucose chains. The addition of another glucose unit yields malto-triose, and a four-glucose chain is malto-tetrose, etc. Further additions will produce dextrins, also called malto-dextrins, and eventually starch.
 Maltose can be broken down into two glucose molecules by hydrolysis. In living organisms, the enzyme maltase can achieve this very rapidly; heating with a strong acid for several minutes will also work.
