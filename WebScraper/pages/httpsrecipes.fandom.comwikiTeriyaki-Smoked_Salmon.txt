Description : 
 A bold combination of real salmon and teriyaki is made tangy, smoked to red-hot perfection, and served with other seafood-based dishes. Soy sauce and sake sometimes work for this, too, while it commonly keeps a smoky aroma with the seafood, real herbs, and spices.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 10 pounds  salmon  fillets 
 1 cup chopped or grated ginger, optional 
 1 cup  salt 
 2 gallons cold  water 
 2 pounds  dark brown sugar 
 1 bottle dry  white wine 
 1 quart  teriyaki sauce 
 6 ounces  garlic powder 
 6 ounces  onion powder 
 4 ounces  pickling spice 
 1 ounce  cinnamon 
 1 ounce  mace 
 4 tablespoons  oregano 
 2 tablespoons  basil 
 fresh  cicely , optional 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients except salmon, mix thoroughly, and let stand for 1 hour. 
 Place the salmon in brine, ensuring that all pieces are covered. 
 Refrigerate and soak for 12 hours. Remove from the brine and rinse thoroughly in cold running  water . 
 Pat the dry with paper towels and air dry in a cool place for at least 1 hour. 
 Place the salmon in the smoker and smoke with  apple  and alder chips (equal amounts of each). 
 Distribute on the racks evenly to make sure you get even smoke distribution. 
 Smoked salmon requires approximately 1 Â½ hour per pound (size of individual piece), depending on cooking temperature and desired dryness. Serve hot and plain over rice, or with any seafood. Garnish with the fresh cicely, if desired.
