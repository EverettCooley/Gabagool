 1 cup  powdered sugar 
 Â½ pound  almond paste 
 Directions :

 This may be put on oiled paper with a pastry bag and tube, or may be dropped in small bits from the tip of a spoon. 
 Bake fifteen to twenty minutes in a cool  oven . 
 When done, invert the paper and wet with a cloth wrung out of cold  water . 
 The macaroons will then easily peel off.
