 Special note by Andy:
 Try this one its very tasty and easy to make. Recipe can be doubled for a very large crowd or occasion. This was one of the last recipes given to me by my friend Marjorie Cottom who died of cancer in the year 2001. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 lbs shredded  cabbage 
 ½  green pepper , shredded 
 ½  sweet red pepper , shredded 
 1 large  carrot , shredded 
 1 stalk  celery , shredded 
 ½ white  onion  or  red onion , shredded 
 Dressing : 
 3 fluid ounces  apple cider vinegar 
 3 ounces French's prepared  mustard 
 2 ounces  ketchup 
 2 ounces  sour cream 
 1 ounce Kraft  Mayonnaise 
 ½ tablespoon  coarse salt 
 ¼ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 ½ cup  granulated sugar 
 Directions : 
 Shredd and toss all vegetables. 
 In a saucepot over low heat, place in the ketchup,  mustard ,  vinegar ,  mayo , sour cream,  salt  and  pepper , (DO NOT ADD  sugar  as that is a last step). 
 Bring all to a low boil. 
 Remove from heat. 
 Pour warm mixture onto all vegies, and toss well. 
 Sprinkle the  white sugar  over top. 
 Toss again well. 
 Cover and chill until serving time. 
 Note that the  mustard  and  cayenne  make this tangy and spicy, and give an  orange  colour apperance. 
 This is very tasty for a BBQ, or large gatherings and I think you will get many compliments on this one.
