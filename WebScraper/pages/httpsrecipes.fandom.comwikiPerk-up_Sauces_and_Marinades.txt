Whatever cuts of meat you prefer, you can bring new zest, taste appeal, and change of pace, with sauces and marinades. A tangy basting sauce gives your grilled food that just-right flavor and marinades let your meat soak up flavor you just can't beat. So, pick and choose, but try a new sauce or marinate your meat the night before for entrees that truly make a meal. 
 
 Pineapple-Orange Sauce 
 Out-on-the Range Sauce 
 Lots of Punch Sauce 
 Old-fashioned Herb Marinade 
 A Little Wine Marinade 
 Add too much spice to your dish: balance out the taste with sugar added in small increments until the flavor is just where you want it. Too much salt - oops Add a peeled potato to your dish. Heat gently, and let the potato absorb the salt. Before serving, remove the potato and discard. 
 Flavor is what sauces and marinades are all about so- ENJOY! Â©Arleen M. Kaptur 2002
