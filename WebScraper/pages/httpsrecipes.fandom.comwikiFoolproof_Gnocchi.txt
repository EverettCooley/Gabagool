 1 x 5-oz box  instant Potato Buds 
 2 cup boiling  water 
 1  egg 's worth  egg replacer  (or two  egg whites  â€” necessary for binding) 
 2 cups  flour  (whole wheat works fine) 
 Directions :

 Cool. 
 Add  egg replacer  and  flour . 
 Knead lightly on floured board. 
 Take a small portion at a time and roll on floured board into strips about 1 inch thick. 
 Cut small pieces about 1 inch long. 
 Roll each piece over a fork, making an impression with your thumb, to give the pieces the classic  gnocchi  shape. 
 Be sure to keep the dough floured well, or it will become sticky. 
 Place the pieces on a floured cookie sheet, making sure they don't touch. 
 Drop the pieces into boiling  water . 
 After they reach the surface (which may be almost immediately), cook them  gently  (don't boil them!) for 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Drain and serve with the sauce of your choice.
