 Description : 
 Sweet  Asian pears  are filled with  honey  and  Chinese dates  and gently steamed. If  Asian pears  are unavailable,  Bartlett pears  can be used instead. Chinese red  dates  are also known as  jujubes  (strictly speaking, they are not a date at all). Their sweet flavor makes them a popular ingredient in Chinese dessert soups and congees, and in steamed foods. If unavailable, regular  dates  or  Raisins  can be used instead.Â 
 Serves 4
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  Asian pears 
 8 teaspoons (just under 3 tablespoons),  honey 
 4 dried  Chinese dates , softened in cold  water , slitted, and the pits removed 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wash the  pears  and pat dry with paper towels. 
 Cut the top off the  pears  and set aside (these will become the lid). 
 Remove the core. If desired, cut off a small slice at the bottom so that the  pear  will stand straight during steaming. 
 Spoon 2 teaspoons  honey  into each  pear .

 Steam the  pears  for 30 minutes, or until the  pears  are tender. Serve warm.
