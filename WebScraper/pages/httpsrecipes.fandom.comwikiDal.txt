 About Dal : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Dal on Wikipedia 
 Dal  is a term common to many South Asian languages referring to pulses stripped of their outer hulls and split, as well as the soup or porridge-like preparation with spices such as turmeric and cumin that is a mainstay of northern Indian cuisine. This preparations virtually always accompanies boiled rice or (usually unleavened) bread. Dal's South Indian counterpart is called  sambar , incorporating tomatoes and other vegetables, tamarind and a somewhat different spicing scheme especially using  curry leaves  ( Murraya koenigii ).
 Hulling pulses improves digestibility and palatability at a cost of some nutritional value and fiber content, not unlike that suffered in the milling of whole grains into refined grains.
