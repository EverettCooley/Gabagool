Description : 
 I love broccoli cheese soup, but I am a really picky eater and I never found a recipe that I completely liked, so a couple of years ago I combined what I liked out of three different recipes and came up with this one. Even the kids request it often.

 Ingredients : 
 4 medium  potatoes , peeled and cubed 
 ½ cup finely diced  onion 
 1 cup water 
 1 tbsp  chicken bouillon 
 3 cups fresh  broccoli  florets 
 3 cups  milk 
 1 cup chopped  ham   [1] 
 salt  and  pepper 
 ¼ cup  flour 
 1 cup diced  Velveeta 
 Directions : 
 Place the potatoes, onion, water and chicken bouillon in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and boil for 10 minutes. 
 Add the broccoli, cover and boil for 10 more minutes. 
 Add 2½ cups of the milk, ham, salt and pepper and bring to a low boil. 
 Put the milk and flour in a container with a tight fitting lid and shake it until it is combined and add to the soup. 
 Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. 
 Add the Velveeta and stir until melted. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   For the ham if I have leftover good ham, I dice it and use it, or if I don't have any leftovers, I just use sliced ham from the deli counter and mince it up.
