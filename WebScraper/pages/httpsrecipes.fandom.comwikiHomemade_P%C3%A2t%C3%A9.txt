 Remove from heat and let get cool for at least 30 minutes. Strain (retaining liquid) and puree liver in Cuisinart or blender. Make sure it is very fine.
 Return to saucepan and add  rosemary , remaining pot liquid and some of the  butter . Heat on very low heat. Mix well and taste. Add more  salt ,  pepper , and/or  rosemary  to taste.
