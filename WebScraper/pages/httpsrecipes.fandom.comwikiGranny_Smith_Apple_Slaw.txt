GRANNY SMITH APPLE SLAW 
This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased 
the family collection from the Hawkins Estate in Dallas, Texas in 1982.
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 granny smith apples cored shredded with peel and very well drained 
 1 carrot peeled and shredded 
 1 cup currants 
 3/4 cup chopped walnuts 
 2 cups mayonnaise 
 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon poppy seeds 
 Directions : 
 In large bowl combine apples, carrot, currants and walnuts.
To make dressing combine remaining ingredients then add 1 cup dressing 
to the slaw.
Mix well and chill before serving.
Add remaining dressing right before serving.
