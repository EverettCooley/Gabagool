 Wikipedia Article  About Monstera on Wikipedia 
 Monstera is a genus of 22 species of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas. The genus is named from the Latin word for "monstrous" or "abnormal", the members of the genus are distinguished by their unusual leaves with natural holes.
 They are evergreen vines, growing to heights of 20 m in trees, climbing by means of aerial roots which act as hooks over branches; these roots will also grow into the soil to help support the plant. The leaves are alternate, leathery, dark green, very large, from 25-90 cm long (up to 130 cm long in M. dubia) and 15-75 cm broad, often with holes in the leaf blade. The flowers are borne on a specialised inflorescence called a spadix, 5-45 cm long; the fruit is a cluster of white berries, edible in some species.
