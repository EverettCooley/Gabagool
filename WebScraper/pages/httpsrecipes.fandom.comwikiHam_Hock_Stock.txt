 Ingredients : 
 1  ham hock 
 1 smoked  ham hock 
 6 cups of  water 
 1 small  white onion , quartered 
 6  garlic  cloves, cut in half 
 1 whole  serrano chile 
 a pinch of whole  black peppercorns 
 4 small  bay leaves 
 3 stalks of  celery , cut in half 
 Directions : 
 Make the stock first. 
 Put the ham hocks in the pressure cooker. 
 Put 6 cups of water over them then set the cooker to brown. 
 Heating the water and the hocks brings it up to pressure quicker. 
 Add the onion, garlic cloves, serrano chile, peppercorns, bay leaves and celery them to the pot. 
 It won't take long for the water to get to get hot, but just before boiling, stop the browning, put on the lid, and set it to high pressure. 
 Cook for 10 minutes. 
 It smells so good!
