Description : 
 Down in Jamaica they've got lots of pretty women and some great ideas for spicing up their island version of guacamole. Tropical fruit, crunchy  coconut  and  piquant pepper  mingle with  avocado  as pleasantly as an ocean breeze.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  California avocados , about 1 pound 
 ½ Tbsp fresh  lime juice 
 ½ cup finely diced fresh  mango 
 ½ finely diced fresh  pineapple , well drained 
 2 Tbsp dried shredded  coconut  (preferably unsweetened) 
 ½ tsp  crushed red pepper flakes 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely mash (do not purée)  avocados ; stir in  lime juice . 
 Fold in remaining ingredients. 
 Guacamole is best made as close to serving as possible. 
 For short-term storage, seal in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole.
