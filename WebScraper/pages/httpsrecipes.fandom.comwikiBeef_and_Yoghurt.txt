Description : 
 A dry  curry . A good, solid  red wine  or a cold  beer  would be good with this dish.
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g  steak , cut into bite-sized pieces 
 1½ teaspoons  salt 
 1¼ cups natural  yoghurt 
 60 g  ghee ,  butter ,  or   margarine 
 2 large  onions , finely sliced 
 3 dessertspoons grated fresh  ginger 
 4 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 2 teaspoons  ground coriander 
 1 teaspoon  garam masala 
 ½ teaspoon  chilli powder 
 2 teaspoons ground  paprika 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 2 teaspoons  turmeric 
 Directions : 
 Put the meat into a bowl and sprinkle it with the  salt ; rub it in well. 
 Pour the  yoghurt  over the meat, cover it, and let it marinate for 24 hours, stirring it occasionally. 
 Heat the  ghee  in a heavy pan and gently fry the  onions ,  garlic  and  ginger  until tender and golden. 
 Add the other spices, stir, and cook gently for about 10 minutes until well mixed and cooked. 
 Add the meat and  yoghurt  mixture, mix everything well, and cook gently for about 1½ hours, or until the meat is tender. 
 If it is too moist for your liking, leave it uncovered for some of the cooking time. 
 I serve this with plain, boiled  rice  as there are enough spices in the meat mixture to flavour the  rice . 
 Pickled  limes , served as a sambal, add a delicious piquancy to this dish.
