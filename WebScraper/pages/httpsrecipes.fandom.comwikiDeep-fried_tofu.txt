 About Deep-fried tofu : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Deep-fried tofu on Wikipedia 
 Tofus such as firm Asian and dry tofu, with their lower moisture content, are cut into bite-sized cubes or triangles and deep fried until they develop a golden-brown, crispy surface (炸豆腐 in Chinese, jadòufu, lit. “fried tofu”). These may be eaten by themselves or with a light sauce, or further cooked in liquids; they are also added to hot pot dishes or included as part of the vegetarian dish called lo han jai.
