Description 
 The  Martini , more so than any other drink, embodies the class and style of the cocktail in the popular imagination. This cocktail is made with gin and vermouth, garnished with either a green olive or a lemon twist. The less vermouth it contains, the drier it is. A martini may be served Straight up or On the Rocks. It may also be made with vodka, in which case it's called a vodka martini. A Gibson is a martini garnished with a tiny white onion.
