      Cuisses de Grenouille     Frog's legs. The only edible part of a frog is its hind legs. The delicate meat is tender and lightly sweet and can be most closely compared to the white meat of a very young chicken. They're usually sold in connected pairs ranging from 2 to 8 ounces. Look for those that are plump and slightly pink. Because their flavor is so subtle, frog's legs should be cooked simply and briefly. A quick dusting of seasoned flour before saut√©ing in butter or olive oil will gild the lily perfectly. Overcooking frog's legs will cause them to toughen.
