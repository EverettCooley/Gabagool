 Description : 
 Who doesn't love buffalo chicken? Whether it's a buffalo chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken wings, buffalo chicken salad... I know that I just can't get enough of the flavor. My brother and I decided we would experiment with a Buffalo Chicken casserole, and this is what we came up with. Enjoy!
