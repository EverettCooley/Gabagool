Ingredients : 
 1/4 cup of each color candy melts (red or pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) 
 6 heaping cups of popped  popcorn , divided, sprinkled with salt (if desired) 
 Instructions : 
 Line a baking tray (or trays) with wax paper and set aside. 
 Separate the popcorn into six heaping cups in separate bowls. 
 In a microwave-save bowl, pour the red or pink candy melts. Microwave at 70 percent power for 90 seconds. Stir to let the residual heat fully melt the candy melts. If needed, microwave at 15-second intervals until melted. 
 Pour in a heaping cup of the popcorn and stir well to coat all of the pieces. 
 Spread the popcorn on the prepared tray to set. 
 Repeat with every other color of candy melts, letting the candy set well, about 30 minutes. 
 Break up the popcorn, if necessary, and serve!
