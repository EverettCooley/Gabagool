Description : 
       Joulutortut     
 Christmas tarts
 
 Ingredients : 
 ready-to-use pastry dough (This is a shortcut, but it is possible, and done in Finland, to prepare the pastry crust from scratch. It needs to be extra flaky) 
 1 lb  prunes 
 water 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 1  egg , beaten (for basting) 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  prunes  in  water  with  sugar  for a few hours, and then cook them till soft. 
 Remove the pits and chop the  prunes  into jam-like consistency. 
 Roll out the crust to about ¼" thickness and cut into desired shapes: they can be round to which a spoonful of  prunes  is placed, the edge turned over to form a semi-round, and the edges are pinched closed tight; or square where the corners are cut in half towards the center and a small amount of the filling in placed in the center. 
 To form pinwheels, turn every other peak to the center. 
 The square shape can also be formed so that all peaks are turned to the center. 
 Before baking, are basted with the beaten  egg . 
 Bake in a hot oven (425°F) for about 10 minutes.
