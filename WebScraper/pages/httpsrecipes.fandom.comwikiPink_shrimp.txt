 About Pink Shrimp : 
 All shrimp are divided into three basic categories: cold-water or northern; warm-water, tropical, or southern; and freshwater. Pink shrimp also spelled Penaeus duorarum, come in a variety of colors, including brownish pink and lemon yellow. Pink coldwater shrimp are one of the most important commercial species of shrimp in the world. Adult pink shrimp live and spawn in highly saline waters. Feeding begins during the first protozoeal stage when the larvae cease to live on yolk and begin to seek nourishment in the water. Fecundity at pink shrimps increased in direct proportion to body weight and as a cube of total length. They are usually found in the Gulf of Mexico over calcareous mud and sands of over mixtures of shell and sand. Pink shrimps feed mostly on the bottom and are regularly omnivores. They ingest algae and fragments of higher plants but also they feed with a variety of little animals. Pink shrimps are known to live a short life, but they can reach the age of five years. Their color can vary from orange till dark pink and are usually five or six cm. with a weight of one hundred grams each.
