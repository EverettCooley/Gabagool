 Ingredients : 
 Brown  basmati rice  2 cups (dry) 
 Frozen  Peas  1 bag 
 tofu  1 block 
 sea salt 
 Mild  Onion  minced 
 Directions : 
 Cook  rice  as you normally would. As  rice  nears completion, prepare  Peas  in a separate pan. While the  Peas  and  rice  are cooking, cut the  tofu  into small cubes. Mix all ingredients into a large bowl and add  sea salt  to taste. For a nice variety, try adding some mild  Onion . Stronger  onions  may over-power the dish (the food too!). 
 
 
 While this is very simple to make, it's actually quite tasty and is one of my favorites (I often over-indulge). Also try using  corn ,  kale , brocolli, or other veggies in place of the  Peas . 
 
 
 After serving the casserole, try dribbling some  flax seed   oil  (or  olive oil ) over it. Yum!
