      Apple Toddy     
 Toddy  is an alcoholic drink, usually served hot.   It is typically made with whiskey, rum or brandy, very hot water, sugar, spices, and lemon. This drink seems to have evolved from  tari , the Hindu word used for the sap or juice of a palm tree. In Asia, this sap was often fermented to create an alcoholic beverage. British sailors picked up on the idea, which eventually evolved into the toddy.
