 About Gorgonzola : 
 An Italian cow's milk cheese (48% fat) that is white or yellow and streaked with blue. It has a distinct smell and can have a mellow, strong, or sharp flavor, depending on its degree of maturity. It is similar to the American blue cheese and the French  roquefort . 
 This famous Italian blue cheese is made of cow's milk. It is rich and creamy with blue-green veins; slightly pungent when young, it gets smellier as it ages. It is the perfect partner to pears, figs and other fruits, and red wine; it melts nicely, too.
