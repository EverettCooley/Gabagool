 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Love Estate in Sachse, Texas in 1984.

 1 cup  mayonnaise 
 1 medium  cauliflower  broken into flowerets 
 1 cup Italian seasoned  breadcrumbs 
 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning, optional

 Place mayonnaise in a large, heavy-duty plastic bag. 
 Add the cauliflower, then seal and shake to coat. 
 Place breadcrumbs in a large heavy duty plastic bag. Add Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs, if desired. 
 Add half of cauliflower mixture then seal and shake to coal. 
 Spread in a single layer onto a lightly greased baking sheet. 
 Repeat with remaining cauliflower and breadcrumbs. 
 Bake at 350Â° F for 1 hour. Serve hot and plain or with any main dish, side dish, or appetizer.
