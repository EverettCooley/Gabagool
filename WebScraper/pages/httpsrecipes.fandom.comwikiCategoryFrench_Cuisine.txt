Diversity, refinement and sophistication are what define the French cuisine. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are the main courses of the day, but snacks, appetizers and cocktail drinks and liquors are part of the French cuisine as well. Some of the most remarkable dishes in the French cuisine include the baguettes, quiches, crème and Tarte flambé, and of course, the French fries. Other great dishes include blanquette de veau, boeuf a la mode, Coq au Vin, blue cheese, raw oysters, Pot-au-feu and the Soufflés. Goose meat is commonly used for the famous foie gras (the liver of a force-fed duck or goose) and for the Cassoulet (a dish made with beans, sausages and preserved duck or goose). Some other sophisticated dishes known world wide, but not very often served by regular French people, are the cuisses de grenouilles (frog legs) and the escargots (edible snails). Desserts are particularly sophisticated and delicious, the most significant ones being the chocolate mousse, the éclairs, profiteroles, Crêpes, and tart Tatin with caramelized apples and a puff pastry base.
