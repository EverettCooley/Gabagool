      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Yep - this is a salad that can be used as an accompaniment for somosas - or  chicken  wings - or whatever you like. It's my very own attempt at a French-style salad comprising fine green-beans,  potatoes ,  tomatoes  and roasted  peppers .
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Here's what you start with:
Basically - it's the following quantities:
 
 150 grams of fine  green beans 
 4 capsicums ( peppers ) in different colours - e.g. red, green, yellow,  orange  etc. 
 Some  cherry tomatoes 
 Some "new"  potatoes  - I always use "Jersey Royal"  potatoes  at this time of year - as they are especially delicious! 
 Directions : 
 Start by roasting the  peppers . Slice them lengthways into 3Â cm-wide slices - and lay them out on a baking tray whilst you preheat the oven at 230 Celsius. Drizzle some  olive oil  over the  peppers  right there on the tray. Then stick in the oven for about 20 mins - turning over halfway.
 
       Layout the sliced pepper on a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil     
         Place into pre-heated oven at 230 C     
 Whilst the  peppers  are roasting - chop the  cherry tomatoes  into quarters ( or halves if they are particularly small) and also chop the  green beans  in half too.
 
         Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters     
         Chop the beans in half     
 Boil the  green beans  and rinsed  potatoes  in two separate saucepans - until they are softish. Not too soft - but soft enough to bite into pleasurably. Make sure you turn over the roasting  peppers  at some point.
 
         Boil the beans and patatoes until soft     
         Turn over the roasting peppers     
 When the  potatoes  are boiled - drain them - and lay them out on a plate to cool - and chop them in half.
 When the  peppers  are fully roasted (and burnt around the edges) place them immediately into a plastic bag (e.g. sandwich or freezer bag) and seal it up and let it sit on the worktop for around 10 minutes. This will loosen the skin from the  peppers  so that they are easy to peel off. 
 
         Chop the cooked patatoes into halves     
         Place the roasted peppers into a plastic bag and seal for 10 minutes     
 Peel off the skins from the  peppers  using your hands - and discard. Then chop the resultant  pepper  fleshes into bite-sized pieces.
 
 
         Peel off and discard the pepper skins     
         Chop the peppers into bite-sizes pieces     
 After the  potatoes ,  green beans  and  peppers  have all cooled off - mix them into a bowl with the  cherry tomato  quarters - and stir in some of your favourite  Salad dressing  - which in my case is French  vinaigrette  - but with a  balsamic vinegar  twist!
 
         Mix everything in a bowl     
         Pour on some dressing     
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
