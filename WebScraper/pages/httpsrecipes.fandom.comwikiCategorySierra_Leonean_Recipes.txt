Appetizers can be both light or complex and sometimes combined with fish or minced or roasted meat. The chicken stew also includes black pepper, lime juice, garlic powder and poultry seasonings. There is a complex recipe that defines both a meat meal and a soup: the West African lemony chicken and okra soup. The okra leaves salad contains pint palm oil, dried fish, beef, shrimps, red peppers, onions and various seasonings. A specific Sierra Leonean soup is the egusi soup, which contains minced meat, ground egusi, beef bullion cube, stockfish and smoked fish, palm oil, pepper, onion and sorrel leaves.
