 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2.2 pounds  pork , preferably ribs 
 2 cups cold  water 
 2 cups white o nion , thinly sliced 
 1 cup  tomato , peeled and diced 
 1/2 cup minced  parsley 
 1 1/2 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1 teaspoon ground  black pepper 
 1 tablespoon crumbled  oregano 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 tablespoon minced  mint 
 1/2 cup red  chile powder 
 1 tablespoon  salt  (to taste) 
 4 cups  water  or broth 
 1 cup  green onion , thinly sliced 
 4  eggs  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Cut the meat in small pieces. 
 Place the pork and the two cups of cold water in a large pot over high heat and boil until all the  water  evaporates, the meat has browned a bit and some of the fat has rendered. 
 Remove the meat from the pot. Stir-fry all the other ingredients, in the order listed, using the fat left in the pot by the cooked  pork . Return the p ork  to the pan; add the four cups of  water  or broth. Bring to a boil and then simmer until the meat is quite tender, about 2 hours. Try to maintain the initial amount of broth. If necessary, add boiling  water  so that the stew does not get very thick. 
 Five minutes before serving, add the green  onion  and remove the pot from the heat.  At this point, quickly stir in the beaten  eggs  (if using) to thicken the stew.
