      Ladotyri     
 The main characteristic of this traditional cheese is that is preserved in olive oil and this is the reason why is called Ladotyri (ladi=olive oil, tyri=cheese). It can spend as much as a year in this state and emerge richer and tastier to the point of decadence.
 Ladotyri has a strong flavour, and a hard texture with slightly salty taste and is mainly consumed as table cheese.
