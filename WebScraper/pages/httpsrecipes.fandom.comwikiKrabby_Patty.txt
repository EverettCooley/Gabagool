Prep Time:10 minutes 
 Cook time:10 minutes 
 Serves: 1 person 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp finely chopped  onion 
 2 tbsp finely chopped  celery 
 4 – 6 tbsp  vegetable oil 
 1 tsp  thyme 
 1 lb frozen  imitation crab meat , (defrosted and finely chopped in a food processor) 
 ¾ cup seasoned  bread crumbs 
 1 tbsp  Dijon mustard 
 2 tbsp  mayonnaise  (plus 1 cup for dipping sauce) 
 2  eggs , lightly beaten 
 salt  and  pepper  (to taste) 
 3 tbsp  ketchup  (for dipping sauce) 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the onions and celery in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the thyme, lower the heat, and cook until the onions are translucent. 
 In a large bowl combine the crabmeat, sautéed onions and celery, bread crumbs, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, egg, salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine. 
 Shape into rounds by using a small ice cream scoop, then gently pat flat. 
 Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet. Working in batches (2 to 3 crab cakes at a time) place the crab cakes in a skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. You may need to add more oil for the second and third batches. 
 Preheat the oven to 400°F. Transfer the crab cakes to the baking pan and bake for 10 minutes. The crab cakes can be kept in a warm oven for approximately 30 minutes, or they may be reheated at serving time. Serve with a kid-friendly dipping sauce. Mix 1 cup of mayonnaise with 3 tablespoons of ketchup. Try eating it with bread.
