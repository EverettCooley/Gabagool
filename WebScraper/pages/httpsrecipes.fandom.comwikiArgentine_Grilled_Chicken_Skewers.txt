Description : 
 I found this one on line while I was putzing around. It sounded good and it seemed quick and easy so I gave it a shot. The flavor was marvelous. It lived up to my expectations. 
 
 4 servings 
 45 minutes 30 mins prep 
 Ingredients : 
 4  chicken  breasts  or  chicken thighs 
 ½  red bell pepper , cut into 1 inch squares 
 ½  green bell pepper , cut into 1 inch squares 
 2  yellow onions , cut into eighths 
 1 cup  cherry tomatoes 
 bamboo  skewers 
 ½ cup  oil 
 3 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1 teaspoon  paprika  (www.worldspice.com has the real stuff) 
 ½ teaspoon fresh Mexican  oregano 
 kosher salt 
 black peppercorns 
 Directions : 
 Soak the skewers for an hour. 
 Set charcoal alight. 
 In your handy mortar grind the oil, garlic, paprika, oregano, salt, and peppercorns. 
 Skin, debone, and de-fat the chicken. 
 Cut into ½ cubes. 
 Rinse, pat dry, stir into marinade. 
 Coat well. 
 Thread the onion, chicken, peppers, and cherry tomatoes alternately onto the skewers. 
 Grill over medium coals for 15-20 minutes 'til everything is done. 
 This works well grilled over a hibachi or other small grill on a picnic. 
 Prepare everything at home and do the grilling at the picnic site. 
 It's almost as good cooked under the broiler at home.
