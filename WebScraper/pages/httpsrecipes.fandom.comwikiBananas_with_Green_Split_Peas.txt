 Peel  bananas  and lay them whole on top of the  Peas  without mixing. 
 Continue to cook for 10 minutes until  bananas  are soft, adding a bit of  water  if necessary to prevent  Peas  from sticking to the bottom of the pot. 
 Meanwhile, heat the  palm oil  in a skillet or pot large enough to hold the  Peas  and  bananas . Brown the  onions . Then with a slotted spoon, remove  bananas  and  Peas  from the first pot and add to the  onions . 
 Sprinkle in the  salt  and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring gently but constantly, until  oil  has been absorbed. Serve hot.
