 Wikipedia Article  About Miso on Wikipedia 
 Miso (Japanese: 味噌) is a thick paste, similar to the Korean doenjang, made by fermenting soybeans with sea salt and kōji, itself the product of fermenting rice, barley or soybeans with a mold culture, kōji-kin (Aspergillus oryzae (麹, Aspergillus oryzae). Often, grains such as barley or rice, and sometimes other ingredients, are added. Miso tastes salty and, depending on the grains used and fermentation time, may also be sweet.
