 Description : 
 Watermelon juice is tasty, especialy on a hot summer day. This drink, however, is made with the intent of being consumed on planets other than Earth. One rarely spoken rule is that if you decide to bring this recipe to the planet Venus, aliens may use telekenises or even worse to capture this bevarage which has a high consentration of nutrients suitible for an extra-terrestrial diet. Luckily, I have provided an option which contains ZAR-85b which is very putrid for aliens. But if you don't live close to a spaceship or a teleport bubble you may enjoy this recipe on Earth.

 1 small or 1/2  watermelon  (medium size)
