Description : 
       Chancho a la Chilena     
 This recipe is for 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 4 pounds boneless  pork loin 
 2 medium  onions , sliced 
 2 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1  carrot , scraped and sliced 
 1 stalk  celery , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 1  bay leaf 
 ½ teaspoon  oregano 
 ½ teaspoon  thyme 
 ¼ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 salt , freshly ground  pepper 
 ½ cup  red wine vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  in a large flameproof casserole and brown the meat lightly all over. 
 Add all the other ingredients to the casserole with enough  water  to cover. 
 Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer gently until the meat is tender, about 3 hours. 
 Allow the meat to cool completely in the stock, then remove to a serving platter. 
 Reserve the stock for another use. 
 Serve the  pork  sliced with  Salsa de Aji Colorado  (red pepper sauce). 
 In Chile the  pork  slices would be covered with the sauce. 
 But since it can be quite incendiary if the  peppers  used are very hot, it is wiser to test one's palate with a little at a time.
