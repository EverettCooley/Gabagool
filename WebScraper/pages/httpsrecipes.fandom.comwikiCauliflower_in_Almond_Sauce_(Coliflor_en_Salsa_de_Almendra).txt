 Description : 
 This recipe is for 2 serves.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium-sized  cauliflower , about 8 inches across 
 salt 
 1 recipe  Bechamel  (White Sauce) 
 1/2 cup finely ground  almonds 
 Directions : 
 Trim the  Cauliflower  and cut a cross in the bottom of the stem end. 
 This speeds up the cooking of the stalk so that it is tender at the same time as the flowerets. 
 Drop, stem end down, into a large saucepan of boiling salted  water , cover, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until just tender. 
 Lift out and place in a serving dish, preferably round, to show off the  Cauliflower . 
 Meantime make the Bechamel. 
 Stir in the  ground almonds , and cook, stirring, over low heat for about 2 minutes to blend the flavors. 
 Mask the  Cauliflower  with the sauce and serve as an accompaniment to any plainly cooked meat, poultry, or shellfish.
