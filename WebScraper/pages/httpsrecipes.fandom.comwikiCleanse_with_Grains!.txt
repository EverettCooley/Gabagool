 Prepare your Herbal Citrus Aromatic Blend by pouring your essential oils into a 10-ml bottle and then adding an organic vegetable oil to fill. Combine oatmeal, cornmeal and wheat germ in a mixing bowl. In an airtight container, gradually blend dry mixture with equal parts water until you create a paste. About 1/2 cup of the mixture will be sufficient for your entire body. Add 15 drops of the aromatherapy blend and mix well again. 
 Massage the scrub gently into your skin. Rinse well with tepid water and pat dry. Follow with a soothing, refreshing all-over body lotion, such as "I Am...Pure Energy," made with Lemongrass, Basil, Grapefruit, Peppermint, Ginger and Dill for an uplifting boost of energy!
