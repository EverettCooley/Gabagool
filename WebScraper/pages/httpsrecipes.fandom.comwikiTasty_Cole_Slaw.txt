 Ingredients : 
 Org.  red cabbage  2 cups shredded 
 Org.  carrots  2 cups shredded 
 Org.  Apple  1 large 
 Org. red or sweet  Onion  1/2 
 Org.  Raisins  1 cup 
 Org.  pecans  1 cup 
 Vegenaise or Nayonaise 4 tbsp 
 sea salt  1/2 tsp 
 Cayenne  1/8 tsp (optional) 
 
 Directions : 
 Shred the cleaned fruits and vegies and place them in a large bowl. I suggest using a food processor with a shredder attachment. In the food processor (with a normal chopping attachment) or in a blender (use a small jar that the blender attachment fits into) chop the  Raisins  and  pecans  together. The  pecans  will help prevent the  Raisins  from clumping up (You can always do your shredding and chopping manually, I've just gotten spoiled using my appliances). Add the Vegenaise (or other vegan mayonaise) and seasoning. Mix well. Enjoy!
