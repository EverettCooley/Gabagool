Description : 
 Adjust the amount of eggplant, garlic and lemon juice in this dip depending on how creamy, garlicky or tart you want it to be. The dip can be served with a garnish of chopped fresh cilantro, olives or pickled cucumbers. Hot pepper sauce or a little ground coriander can be added too. Make sure to have toasted wedges of pita bread on hand for dipping.

 2 – 4  garlic  cloves, chopped 
 6 – 10 tbsp  tahini

 Directions : 
 Place the eggplant(s) directly over the flame of a gas stove or on the coals of a barbecue.
