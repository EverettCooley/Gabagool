 The Christian Williams, named after its creator, is a 50/50 mix of orange juice and apple juice.
 
 History : 
 The Christian Williams was created one morning in Munich Germany when its inventor mixed the only two juices available at the breakfast buffet. Christian detests the smell of fresh oranges and the texture of pulp, but loves the acidic kick. To make orange juice tolerable, he mixed it with apple juice and the rest, as they say, is history.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Pulp-free orange juice 
 Apple juice 
 Directions : 
 Mix the orange and apple juices in a 50/50 blend. It does not matter which of the two juices is poured into the glass first. Stirring is not required.
