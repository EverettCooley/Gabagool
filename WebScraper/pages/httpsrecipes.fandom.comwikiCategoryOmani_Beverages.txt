 An essential breakfast component is tea, which in most of the cases is prepared with water, sugar, plants or fruits, ground ginger or cardamom, and milk. After dinner, the Omani people use to serve red tea, which is exactly the opposite from white tea usually served in the morning. For a real strong Omani coffee you need water, freshly ground coffee, ground cardamom, and cloves. For those who lack vitamin C, it is indicated that they should drink iced hibiscus tea and Omani lemon tea, especially if they have flu. The ones lacking calcium or energy definitely have to consume a buttermilk drink or a fruit shake.
