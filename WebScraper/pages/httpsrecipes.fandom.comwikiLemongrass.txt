 About Lemongrass : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Lemongrass on Wikipedia 
 Cymbopogon (lemon grass, lemongrass, citronella grass or fever grass) is a genus of about 55 species of grasses, native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Old World. It is a tall perennial grass.
 One of the most important flavorings in Thai cooking, this herb has long, thin, gray-green leaves and a scallion-like base. The long, pale-green stalks have a woody texture and a lemony scent, seldom eaten because of the fibrous texture; placed in sauces, soups, and curries. Citral, an essential oil also found in lemon peel, gives lemon grass its sour-lemon flavor and fragrance. It is used to make tea and to flavor soups and other dishes. Lemon grass is also called citronella and sereh.
