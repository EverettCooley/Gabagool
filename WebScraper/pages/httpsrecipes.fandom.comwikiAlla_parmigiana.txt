A term describing food that is made or cooked with Parmesan Cheese. For instance, veal parmigiana is a pounded veal cutlet dipped in an egg-milk solution and then into a mixture of breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese and seasonings. The cutlet is then saut√©ed and covered with a tomato sauce. Eggplant parmigiana consists of eggplant slices prepared in the same manner. Slices of Mozzarella Cheese are sometimes melted on top of the food prior to adding the tomato sauce.
