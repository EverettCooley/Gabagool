 There is a trick to producing a creamy lump-free  oat bran . Once you have achieved this skill, you will produce a breakfast that is unparalleled in flavor and health. Allow  water  to come to a brisk boil, add  oat bran  slowly while whisking vigorously. Stir continuously at low heat. Then let stand for five minutes. If you have a lumpy mass, you can redeem yourself by throwing it into a food processor for 30 seconds. Your family will never know the difference. This breakfast cereal is filled with digestible fiber which has recently been discovered to lower blood cholesterol while increasing regularity. My daughter came up with the idea of adding slices of  Apple  to her  oat bran  and she loves it. Recipe reprinted with permission from HealthRecipes.com
