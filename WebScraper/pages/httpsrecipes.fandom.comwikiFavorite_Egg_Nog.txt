Ingredients : 
 24  eggs , separated 
 2 cups	 sugar 
 1 quart  bourbon 
 2 cups	 brandy 
 1 quart  heavy cream 
 2 quarts  milk 
 1 quart vanilla  ice cream 
 nutmeg 
 Directions : 
 Beat  egg yolks  and  sugar  until thick. 
 Add  bourbon  and  brandy  and stir thoroughly. 
 The liquor "cooks" the  eggs 
 Add  cream  and  milk  and continue whipping. 
 Break up the  ice cream  and add. 
 Beat  egg whites  until stiff and fold in. 
 Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. 
 Sprinkle lightly with  nutmeg . 
 Notes : 
 This is fairly potent and deceptively smooth, so you might wish to cut back on the  Bourbon  and  brandy  a little. 
 If you can get it where you are, then the only  ice cream  to use in this recipe is on of the following Blue Bell Creamery flavors - natural  vanilla bean , homemade  vanilla , or French  vanilla . 
 Any good  bourbon  or sour mash will do, but old forester seems to add a special something to the taste. 
 As for the  brandy , don't waste the VSOP, but don't use that buck-fifty-a-liter varnish remover that you picked up on that last trip to Tiajuana, either.
