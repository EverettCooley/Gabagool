 Ingredients : 
 butter, to grease the baking sheet and paper 
 5  egg yolks 
 1 cup fine  granulated sugar 
 6 ounces of  dark sweet chocolate 
 3 tablespoons cold  coffee 
 5 stiffly beaten  egg whites 
 cocoa , for dusting 
 2 cups  heavy cream , whipped and sweetened and flavored to taste 
 Directions : 
 Butter a large baking sheet, line it with wax paper and butter the paper. 
 Beat 5 egg yolks until light and fluffy. 
 Gradually add 1 cup fine granulated sugar and beat until the mixture is very thick and pale in color. 
 Melt 6 ounces of dark sweet chocolate over low heat, add 3 tablespoons cold coffee. 
 Let mixture cool. 
 Finally, fold in 5 stiffly beaten egg whites. 
 Spread the batter evenly over the prepared sheet and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 15 minutes or until the cake tests done. 
 Be careful not to over bake. 
 Cover the cake with a damp towel for 30 minutes, until it is cool. 
 Loosen it from the baking sheet and dust the surface generously with cocoa. 
 Turn the cake over onto a sheet of wax paper and gently remove the paper from the bottom. 
 Spread the cake with 2 cups heavy cream, whipped and sweetened and flavored to taste, and roll it lengthwise into a long slim roll. 
 To roll this delicate cake, lift up 2 corners of the wax paper and flip over about 2 inches of the cake onto itself. 
 Continue to roll by lifting the wax paper. 
 The last flip should deposit the cake onto a long wooden board or platter. 
 Dust the top with a little more cocoa.
