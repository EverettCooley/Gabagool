Description : 
 From my Aunt Maggie's Estate. She is the one that got me used to eating different vegetables as a young child. She had a magnificent garden and was a fabulous cook. This recipe indicates it came from a 1927 Farmer's Almanac. I also make this dish when my pastor comes to dinner, he is a huge sprouts fan.
