 Ingredients : 
 couple of pounds of  Halibut 
 enough cooking  oil  to allow deep frying 
 1 	cup 	 flour 
 one 12-ounce bottle of 
 beer 
 1 	tbsp 	Of  paprika  and 1 ½ tsp 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best. 
 The flavor of dark beers is too strong. 
 Cut  Halibut  into 1-inch-thick chunks. 
 Heat  oil  in a deep-fat fryer to 375 °F. 
 Make batter by combining remaining ingredients. 
 Dip the  Halibut  into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot  oil  a few at a time. 
 Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown ~ just a few minutes. 
 Halibut  overcooks easily, so try not to overdo it. 
 Remove the fish pieces from the  oil  and drain on paper towels; serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments.
