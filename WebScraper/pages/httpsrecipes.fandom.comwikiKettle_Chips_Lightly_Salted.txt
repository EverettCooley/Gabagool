 Description : 
 Lightly Salted Kettle Chips are hand cooked in small batches using  sunflower  and  safflower oil . Then, the chips are coated with a small amount of salt.
 
 Reviews : 
 Ironically, the common reaction of the snack reviewers at  taquitos.net  was that (despite being low-salt potato chips) these chips needed more salt. Yet, it is this reason that the reviewers felt that the name "lightly salted" was an apt description for the chips. Overall, the taquitos crew felt that the chips had a good potato flavor.
 Members of  Tulsa World's  Lunch Bunch gave the chips a higher ratingâ€”an A- overall for the "satisfying crunch and non-greasy taste". The reviewers did point out, however, that if you do not like lightly colored chips than these are probably not the right snack for you.
