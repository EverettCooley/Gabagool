Ingredients : 
 Cooked  rice 
 Meat 
 patacones 
 1 lb beans or  Lentils 
 1/4 lb  Pork  skin (if you don't find it you can use  Bacon ) 
 2 medium  red onions  chopped 
 2 medium  green peppers  chopped 
 1 medium  green peppers  whole 
 2  garlic  beans 
 culantro 
 Achiote 
 salt ,  pepper ,  comino , adobo 
 Ajinomoto (monosodic glutamate) 
 Directions : 
 4 hours before (or overnight) soak the beans/ Lentils  in  water . After that rinse them. 
 Cook the  rice  as usual. 
 In a pot make a refrito with the  onions ,  peppers   garlic   Achiote   salt ,  pepper ,  comino , ajinomoto and adobo. Fry the pig skin in the refrito. Add the beans/ Lentils , whole  green pepper ,  culantro  and 5-6 cups of  water  and a some forks/knives/spoons (to absorb the heat better). Let it boil and boil and boil. Check the  water  regurlarly, add more if neaded. When it's almost done check the  salt /seasoning and add more as neaded, check the color and if neaded add a bit more of  Achiote  (color depends on which bean you are using, the photo is using  Lentils , so it's very dark). Cook until the consistency is similar to the photo on the top, and take out the whole  pepper  and  culantro  or what's left of it. 
 Cut the Meat so it's very thin and broad, you do this by cutting a regular filet transversally by halve, but not separating the 2 parts (as if you where onfolding a folded napkin), repeat the procedure until you can't continue cutting. Smash the meat with a stone or wooden hammer. season with  comino ,  salt  and adobo and apply  Achiote  until the meat gets  orange . Broil the meat over charcoal, or fry it. 
 Make the  patacones  as usual.
