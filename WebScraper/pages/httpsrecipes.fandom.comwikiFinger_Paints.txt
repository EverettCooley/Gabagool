Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  flour 
 ½ cup  salt 
 ½ to ¾ cup  water , enough to make the consistency of a thick gravy 
 food coloring 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  food coloring  into the  water  and then add the  salt  and  flour . 
 Mix well. 
 Note : 
 I bought the Tupperware small snack cups (the ones in red, blue, yellow and green) and then matched the colors.
 
 It makes a great gift and easy to find the color.
