 Description : 
 Like I said, without the VLF subs the recipe is tested. I'm going to be experimenting with this soon and post any successes. I love to feed this to my carnivorous so. He never guesses, heehee.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Graham cracker crust : 
 10  graham crackers 
 ¼ cup  margarine  (¼ cup  applesauce   or  enough  water  to moisten) 
 Filling : 
 1 cup  semi-sweet chocolate  or  carob chips 
 1 lbs  soft   or   silken tofu  (low fat tofu) 
 ¼ cup skim  milk   or   soy milk 
 ⅓ cup  honey 
 1 tbsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 Pulverize the graham crackers in blender or food processor until finely ground. 
 Add the margarine to the container, and process until well integrated with the graham cracker crumbs. 
 Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a nine inch pie pan. 
 Melt the  chocolate  or  carob chips  with 2 tbsp of  water  in a heavy saucepan or double boiler. 
 Combine the  tofu  with the melted chips and remaining ingredients in blender or food processor. 
 Process until velvety smooth. 
 Pour into the pie crust and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is firm and the crust is golden. 
 Serve at room temperature or chilled.
