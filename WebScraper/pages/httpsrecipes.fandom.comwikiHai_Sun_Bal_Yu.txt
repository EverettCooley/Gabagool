 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 1-2 tablespoons  cornflour 
 1 teaspoon  sesame oil 
 Directions : 
 Put the abalone into the refrigerator for 10–15 minutes to 'put it to sleep'. 
 This will make it easier to remove from the shell. 
 When chilled, lift it out of the shell with a very strong, thin, steel-bladed knife. 
 Carefully cut and lever between the flesh and the shell, making sure not to pierce the flesh as it gives a bad taste. 
 Remove the intestines from the flesh very carefully, too. 
 Slice the  sea cucumber  and abalone very thinly. 
 Heat wok to a high heat, then add the  oil . 
 Add all the cloves of  garlic  and stir fry for a few minutes. 
 Add spring  onion , and then add the  sea cucumber ,  chicken stock ,  soy sauce ,  carrots ,  vinegar ,  rice wine  and  sugar . 
 Stir through the abalone last. 
 Cook for only a minute. 
 Mix  cornflour  with a little cold  water , then stir through the mixture. 
 Add  sesame oil . 
 Remove from heat and serve with  rice  or noodles..
