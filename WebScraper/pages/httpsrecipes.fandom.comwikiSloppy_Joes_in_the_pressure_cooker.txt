Ingredients
2 pounds lean ground beef 
1 cup chopped onion (1 large) 
1/2 cup chopped green sweet pepper 
1 clove garlic, minced 
1/2 cup regular rolled oats 
1 tablespoon brown sugar 
1 14-1/2-ounce can stewed tomatoes 
1/3 cup water 
3 tablespoons yellow mustard 
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
12 Kaiser rolls, split and toasted 
 Directions
1. In a 4- or 6-quart pressure cooker cook ground beef, onion, sweet
pepper, and garlic over medium heat until meat is browned. 
 2. Add the oats, brown sugar, undrained tomatoes, water, mustard, and
Worcestershire sauce. 
 3. Lock lid in place. Place pressure regulator on vent pipe (if you
have a first-generation cooker). Over high heat, bring cooker up to
pressure. Reduce heat just enough to maintain pressure and pressure
regulator rocks gently; cook for 8 minutes. 
 4. Quick-release the pressure. Carefully remove lid. For a thicker
consistency, return to boiling and simmer, uncovered, until thickened. 
 5. Spoon 1/2 cup of the ground beef mixture onto each roll. Makes 12
servings (6 cups of meat). 
 Make-Ahead Tip: Cool meat mixture. Cover and chill up to 24 hours.
Reheat in saucepan on rangetop, stirring frequently. Toast rolls and
serve as above.
