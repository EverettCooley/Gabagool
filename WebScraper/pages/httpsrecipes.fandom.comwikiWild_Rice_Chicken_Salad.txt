 Ingredients : 
 1 	 cup uncooked  wild rice 
 2 	cups diced cooked  Chicken  (or 1 large can of  Chicken , drained) 
 1 	cup  Red Grapes , halved 
 1 	cup sliced  water chestnuts 
 1/2 	cup  Mayonnaise 
 1/4 	cup chopped  red onions 
 1/2 	teaspoon  lemon juice 
 1 	cup cashews or  almonds 
 1/2 	cup craisins (optional) 
 salt  and  pepper , to taste 
 Directions : 
 1. Cook  rice  according to package directions. Drain and cool to room temperature. Add rest of ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Cover and chill a couple hours before serving (overnight is fine).
 2. Tips: I have been using the Uncle Ben's 90 second microwave pouch for the  rice  part. I use the long  grain  and  wild rice  mix.
 3. I also think it tastes better with canned  Chicken .
