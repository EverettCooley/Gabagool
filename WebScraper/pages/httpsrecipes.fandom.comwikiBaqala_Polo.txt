 Description : 
 Iranian rice with beans and dill weed. This is one of the most amazing dishes I've ever eaten. Rich and savory!
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups  long-grain rice , well-rinsed 
 8 cups  water 
 salt 
 ¼ cup melted  margarine 
 ⅛ teaspoon  saffron , dissolved in 2 tbs warm  water  (optional) 
 1 lb frozen  lima beans 
 ¼ cup dried  dill weed , or ¾ cup fresh 
 Directions : 
 Cook  lima beans  until done. Drain. Set aside. 
 Bring a large pot of salted  water  to boil. 
 Add  rice  to  water . Boil 5–10 minutes, until  rice  is no longer crunchy, but still firm. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. 
 Drain  rice  in colander. 
 Mix  beans  and  dill weed  with the  rice . 
 Put half of the melted  margarine  in the bottom of the  rice  pot. 
 Put the  rice  back into the pot, a spoonful at a time, heaping it into a mound, not touching sides of pot. 
 With a chopstick or similar tool, poke holes in the  rice  in several places. 
 Pour the remaining melted  margarine  over the  rice . 
 Cover the underside of the pot lid with a dish towel, and put lid tightly on pot. 
 Cook  rice  about 20 minutes over medium heat, then turn heat to low, and cook for another 30 minutes. 
 The  rice  on the bottom of the pot should become golden and crispy. 
 Soak bottom of pot in cold  water  for a few minutes, to loosen this. 
 Put  rice  onto a serving platter, surrounded by chunks of crispy  rice . 
 Take ⅔ cup of the  rice , mix it with the dissolved  saffron , and sprinkle over the rest of the  rice  as a garnish.
