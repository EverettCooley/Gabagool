Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Amarone

An Italian wine that is made using the Passito Method in the Veneto region. During the drying process, the grapes may develop Botrytis Cinerea, giving them added intensity and fullness. If the process of fermentation stops, either naturally or by human intervention, the wine is left with residual sugar. The resulting wine is a Recioto. If the fermentation process continues, the resulting wine is dry. The dry wine is an Amarone, which means strongly bitter.
