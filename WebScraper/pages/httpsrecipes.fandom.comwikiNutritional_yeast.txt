 Wikipedia Article  About Nutritional yeast on Wikipedia 
 Nutritional yeast, similar to  brewer's yeast , is a nutritional supplement popular with vegans and the health conscious who use it as an ingredient in recipes or simply as a condiment. It is a deactivated yeast, usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
 It is an excellent source of protein and vitamins, especially the B-complex vitamins. It is also naturally low in fat and sodium. Some brands of nutritional yeast, though not all, also contain vitamin B12, which is rare in non-animal sources.
 Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy, creamy flavor which makes it popular as an ingredient in cheese substitutes. It is often used by vegans in place of Parmesan cheese. Another popular use is as a topping for popcorn. Some progressive movie theaters are beginning to offer it along with salt or cayenne pepper as popcorn condiments.
