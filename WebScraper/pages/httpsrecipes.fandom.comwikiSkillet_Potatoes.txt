Ingredients : 
 ½ bag Cascadian Country Style  potatoes  (frozen mix of  potatoes ,  peppers , and  onions ) 
 1  apple juice  (small amount) 
 3 slice  Yves' Canadian Bacon  (veggie and non-fat) 
 1 pack Hain fat-free gravy mix 
 Directions : 
 Chop up the “Canadian bacon” slices into bite size pieces. 
 Heat  apple juice  in nonstick skillet. 
 Add enough  potatoes  to more or less form one layer. 
 Sprinkle the chopped up “Canadian bacon” on top. 
 Stir/turn over a couple of times, several minutes apart, to prevent excess sticking (i like crisp  potatoes  so i let it stick a bit). 
 While  potatoes  are cooking, mix up gravy mix (i was so brain damaged i just microwaved some leftover gravy that i found in the fridge :-), pour over  potatoes  to taste and eat. 
 Some good bread to sop up the gravy would be a plus. 
 Next time I'll add some other frozen veggies.
