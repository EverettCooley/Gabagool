The Sweet Potato vs. The Yam 
 It seems that most people get confused as to what is a sweet potato and what is a yam! In fact, in the United States, most people use both terminologies to refer to a sweet potato, when neither of these two vegetables is related! 
The sweet potato is found in tropical America and is a part of the Morning Glory family. 
The yam is a tuber (a bulb) of a tropical vine found in Central & South America, as well as the West Indies, Africa and Asia. 
Varieties There are mainly two varieties of sweet potato. The pale sweet potato has a very thin yellow skin with a bright yellow flesh. This variety is neither sweet nor moist, but more the texture of a white baking potato. The darker skinned sweet potato has a thicker orange skin with a sweet moist flesh. 
The true yam is not marketed or grown widely in the United States. Where it is marketed, is usually in Latin American markets. A yam can be as small as a potato and can grow as large as 7 feet and weigh over 120 pounds! The flesh can range in color from off-white to yellow to pink to purple! The skin color can be from off-white to a dark brown. 
Season Both the sweet potato and the yam are available fresh from October through March. 
How to Select When trying to choose a sweet potato, choose a medium sized variety with smooth unbruised skin. 
You will want to choose an unblemished yam with unwrinkled skin. 
Storage Store your sweet potatoes in a dry, dark 55 degree F (12 – 13 degrees C) area for approximately a month. Otherwise, use your sweet potato within the week. Never place a sweet potato in the refrigerator.

Nutritional Qualities Sweet potatoes have high Vitamins A and C.
