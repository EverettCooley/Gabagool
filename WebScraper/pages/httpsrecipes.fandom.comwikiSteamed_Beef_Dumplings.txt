       Steamed Beef Dumplings     
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce  or  (1 ¾ tablespoons reduced-sodium  soy sauce ) 
 1 teaspoon  cornstarch 
 1 cup finely chopped  bok choy 
 1 medium  carrot , shredded, about ½ cup 
 4 tablespoons thinly sliced  green onion , reserve 2 tablespoons for sprinkling 
 2 tablespoons snipped fresh  cilantro 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ¾ pound lean, ground  beef 
 ¼ cup  rice vinegar   or  (1 cup white vinegar) 
 ¼ cup dark  soy sauce 
 snipped fresh  chives , optional 
 Directions : 
 Combine  flour , ½ teaspoon  salt , and ⅔ cup boiling  water  in a medium mixing bowl, stirring constantly with a fork. Add ½ cup cold  water ; mix with the hands until dough forms a ball. Cover; set aside. 
 Stir together hoisin or  soy sauce  and cornstarch in a medium mixing bowl. Mix up  bok choy ,  carrot , 3 tablespoons  green onion ,  cilantro , and ¼ teaspoon  salt . 
 Add ground  beef  and mix well. Using about 1 tablespoon of the filling for each, shape filling into 30 balls. Set aside. 
 Divide dough in half. Return one portion to the bowl; cover and set aside. Divide the other portion into 15 balls on a well-floured surface. 
 Roll each dough ball into a 3-inch circle. Place the beef mixture in the center of each circle. Fold the dough up and around all but the top of the meatball, pleating dough firmly. 
 Gently flatten the bottom of each dumpling. Repeat with the remaining dough and meatballs to make 30 dumplings in total. 
 Bring  water  to a boil in a steamer or dutch oven. Place dumplings, with open sides up, on a greased steamer rack; make sure the dumplings do not touch one another. 
 Place the rack over, but not touching, with the boiling  water . Cover and steam dumplings for 16 to 18 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160° F. Meanwhile, combine  rice vinegar  or white vinegar and  soy sauce . 
 Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon thinly sliced  green onion  and chives. Sell per piece, if desired. Serve hot and plain with rice.
