 About Sweet gooseberry : 
 Gooseberries are derived from two important species like the European gooseberry or Ribes grossularia which is native to the Caucasus Mountains and North Africa, and the American gooseberry or Ribes hirtellum that belongs to north-central and northeastern United States. The most common names are: Gooseberry in Englisn, Stachelbeere in German, Stekbes in Flemish, Groseille a Maquereaux in French, and Uva Spina in Italian. Under optimum conditions, gooseberries grow to 3 feet tall and 6 feet wide. The flowers are green with pink flushed petals and they open in early spring, being self-fertile and pollinated by insects and wind. The fruit has many seeds at its center and it can be yellow, white or gray-green, green, or having shades of red from pink to purple to almost black. Morning sun proves to be excellent for gooseberries and in the places where summers are hot, the bushes grow better and produce better fruit in heavier soils. Sweet gooseberries are excellent in preparing tarts but one should know that the fruit must be fully ripe if it is used as ingredient in different deserts.
