Apple Popover Recipe
 
    [image: C]*oming up with a great breakfast or brunch dish can be a
 
 challenge. One nice dish that doesn't get a lot of attention these days is
homemade popovers. Popovers start with a simple batter made with eggs,
flour, milk, and butter that is like the batters used to make Yorkshire
Pudding, Dutch Babies, and even Pancakes. Although we normally think of
popovers as muffin-sized, for this recipe we are going to make one large
billowing popover that is light and tasty with a crisp golden brown outside
crust and a soft moist interior. * * *
 
 Looking at this recipe you immediately know it is not a normal popover. 
 What makes it so different, other than its size, is that it starts with a
layer of lightly sweetened saut�ed apples. The saut�ed apples are placed on
the bottom of your pan and then the popover batter, made in your blender or
food processor, is poured over the top. It is then placed in a very hot oven
and as the batter bakes it puffs up and eventually turns a beautiful golden
brown color. While the outside of the popover becomes nice and crispy, you
will find that the inside remains soft and custard-like. It is important,
though, not to open the oven door while it is baking, as the batter may
collapse. This dish needs to be served immediately after baking and with a
dusting of confectioners sugar and a dollop of softly whipped cream, it is a
real crowd pleaser. *
 
 Note: In the above picture you will notice that I have used both sliced 
 apples as well as fresh blackberries. To add fresh blackberries to this
recipe, toss them into the pan when you are about halfway through saut�ing
the apples. You can make this popover using other fruits like sliced pears,
nectarines or peaches as well as raspberries, blueberries, pitted cherries,
or strawberries.. *
 
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and place the rack
 
 in the center of the oven.
 For Apples: In a large 9- or 10- inch (23 or 25 cm) heavy nonstick ovenproof
skillet melt the butter. Add the sliced apples, sugar, and cinnamon and
saut�ed the apples until tender.
 For the Popover Batter: In your food processor or blender place all the
batter ingredients. Process for about 45 - 60 seconds, scraping down the
sides of the bowl as needed. Once the batter is completely smooth, pour over
the apples.
 Bake for about 20 minutes or until the popover is puffed and golden brown
Do not open the oven door until the end of the baking time or it may
collapse. Serve immediately with a dusting of c@���Xar and softly whipped
cream.
 Serves 4.

My favorite line from a movie & so true :-) The American President
 They don't have a choice! Rob
Rumson's the only one doing the
talking. People want leadership.
And in the absence of genuine
leadership, they will listen to
anyone who steps up to the
microphone. They want leadership,
Mr. President. They're so thirsty
for it, they'll crawl through the
desert toward a mirage, and when
they discover there's no water,
they'll drink the sand.
 SHEPHERD
 
   (evenly)
 
 Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
sentence with two hands and a
flashlight. People don't drink the
sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
They drink it 'cause they don't know
the difference.
