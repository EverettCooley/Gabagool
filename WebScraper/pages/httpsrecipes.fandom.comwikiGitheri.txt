 Description : 
 This dish is a basic maize (corn) and bean stew and it originated in the Kikuyu tribe in Africa. It is a great source of protein.
 
 Ingredients : 
 dried whole kernel  corn  ( maize ); 
 rinsed in cold  water 
 dried beans ( kidney beans  or similar); 
 soaked in cold  water  for a few hours, rinsed 
 Directions : 
 In a large pot, combine equal amount dried  corn  and beans. Add enough cold  water  to cover. Bring to a boil and cook over high heat for ten minutes. 
 Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for two hours or until  corn  and beans are tender. Cook until almost dry: in the finished dish, most of the  water  should be absorbed or evaporated, and the  corn  and beans should be tender yet still intact, not mushy. Season with  salt ,  oil , or fat.
