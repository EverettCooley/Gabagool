Description : 
 I first had these on a trip to California with my friend and his sister. We had them picnic-style, served cold, with nane lavash, and chutney. You can serve them warm also. They are good as an appetizer as well as a main course.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  potatoes 
 1 lb lean  ground beef  (or  lamb ) 
 1 medium  onion , minced 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 2  eggs 
 1 pinch  saffron  (optional) 
 1 pinch  turmeric  (optional) 
 2 cups  breadcrumbs 
 oil  (for frying) 
 Directions : 
 Peel  potatoes  and dice. 
 Boil  potatoes  in  water  for 15–20 minutes or until fork-tender; drain. 
 Mash  potatoes ; allow to cool. 
 Add ground  beef , minced  onion ,  salt ,  pepper ,  eggs , and spices (if desired) to  potato  and mix with your fingers until the consistency is dough-like. 
 Take 2 spoonfuls of meat mixture and form into a small flat patty and dredge in breadcrumbs and set aside on waxed paper. 
 Repeat with more meat mixture until you have quite a few made. 
 Fry patties in shallow layer of  oil , until they are cooked through and golden brown; drain on paper toweling.
