An unrefined sugar or raw sugar made from the juice of  sugar cane . Dark brown in color, Barbados sugar is fine-grained and soft-textured similar to  brown sugar , providing a distinctively strong flavor when added to foods. It is commonly used as a balancing ingredient for recipes requiring  bicarbonate of soda , allowing the flavor of the sugar to overpower and lessen the strong soda flavor. It is also a good sugar for toffee or  gingerbread  recipes. Barbados sugar is often considered to be the same as or referred to as  Muscovado sugar , however a muscovado sugar has a coarser texture than the Barbados sugar.
