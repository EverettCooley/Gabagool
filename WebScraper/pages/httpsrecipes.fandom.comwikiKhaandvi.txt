      Khaandvi     
 Ingredients : 
 150 ml thick  buttermilk 
 115 gms  bengal gram   flour 
 1 cup  water 
 2  green chilies 
 1" piece  ginger 
 ½ tsp  turmeric powder 
 salt  to taste 
 Garnish : 
 1 tbsp  coconut 
 ½ cup  coriander leaves 
 Tempering : 
 2 Kashmiri  red chilies 
 ¾ tsp  mustard seeds 
 ¼ tsp  asafoetida powder 
 1½ tbsp  oil 
 Directions : 
 Grind together green chilies and  ginger  with a little  water  to form a paste. 
 Set aside. 
 Grate the  coconut  and finely chop the  coriander leaves  and set aside. 
 Mix together the  buttermilk ,  gram flour  and  water . 
 Mix all the ingredients together, (except those for the tempering and garnishing) into a smooth solution. 
 Cook over a medium flame until all the  water  has been absorbed and a soft dough like consistency has been obtained. 
 It should be pliable enough to spread. 
 Grease the reverse side of 2-3 steel thalis with a little  ghee  and spread the mixture as thinly as possible over it. 
 The number of thalis you will require will depend upon the thickness of the dough you spread. 
 Spread the dough while it is still hot. 
 Once you have finished spreading all the dough, take a knife and placing each thali in front of you, cut 1 ?" to 2" wide strips. 
 Then roll them the way you would a Swiss roll. 
 Heat the  oil  in a pan. 
 Add the  mustard seeds  and once they start crackling, add the red chilies and  asafoetida powder . 
 As the ingredients sizzle, pour the contents over the prepared khaandvi. 
 Garnish the khaandvi with the  grated coconut  and the chopped  coriander leaves . 
 Serve hot or cold.
