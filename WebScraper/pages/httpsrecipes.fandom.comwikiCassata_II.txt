Description : 
 Cassata can be either fruit-filled  ice   cream , as it is here, or a rich layer cake with  ricotta cheese , fruit,  chocolate , and  cream .
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 tablespoons  dark rum  or  amaretto 
 1 tablespoon  orange-flavored liqueur

 Directions : 
 Combine  rum , liqueur, and  candied fruit  in a small bowl; set aside for at least half an hour. 
 Meanwhile, line a 2-quart loaf pan or mold with a large piece of plastic wrap, pressing it well into the corners. In a medium bowl, whip the  cream  to soft peaks. 
 Spoon softened  ice cream  into a large bowl; fold in rum-fruit mixture,  pistachio nuts , and  chocolate . Gently fold in  whipped cream . 
 Pour into plastic-lined pan. Tap the pan against a cutting board several times to fill the corners. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight. 
 To serve, invert the pan on a chilled platter. Lift off the pan and remove the plastic wrap. Garnish cassata with  whipped cream  rosettes,  candied cherries , or a light dusting of  cocoa  (if desired). Cut into slices.
