      Sablefish     Also known as "Alaska cod", "black cod" and "butterfish", the sablefish is actually neither a cod nor a butterfish. It ranges in size from 1 to 10 pounds and is found in deep waters off the Pacific Northwest coast. The white flesh of the sablefish is soft textured and mild-flavored. Its high fat content makes it an excellent fish for smoking and it's commonly marketed as smoked black cod. Sablefish is available year-round whole, as well as in fillets and steaks. It can be prepared in a variety of ways including baking, broiling or frying.
