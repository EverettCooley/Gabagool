 Description : 
 Guacamole is best made as close to service as possible. This countrified Spanish dip is made with real fruits and vegetables and is great with other side dishes, as it often keeps a tangy aroma with the avocados and alcohol content.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  California avocados 
 1 cup coarsely chopped  green olives 
 ½ cup coarsely chopped, toasted,  slivered almonds 
 4 large cloves  garlic , chopped finely 
 1  jalapeño pepper , chopped finely 
 ¼ cup moderate-dry  sherry 
 2 tbsp. finely chopped  parsley 
 salt , to taste, depending on saltiness of the olive 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely mash  California avocados . Fold in remaining ingredients with the rubber spatula. 
 Spoon the Spanish-style guacamole into a fresh container and reserve this in the refrigerator. Serve with  pork  rinds, potato or corn chips, or other side dishes.
