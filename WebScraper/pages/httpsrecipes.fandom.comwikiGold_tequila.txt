      Margarita     A strong, well-known Mexican liquor distilled from the fermented juice of the blue agave plant, a member of the lily family, that is grown in designated regions of Mexico. Clear to light golden brown in color, tequila is classified as either Blue Agave tequila or Mixto, depending on the amount of agave juice contained in the tequila. Blue agave is 100% pure agave while Mixto is a blend that is made with a minimum of 51% agave juice and the remaining percent consisting of sugars. If the label on the tequila bottle does not display "100% blue agave" the product is Mixto tequila.
