 Description : 
 If  black beluga lentils  are unavailable, use the green Puy variety from France. (Common  brown lentils  are too floury for this dish.) Serves 10 persons.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4½ cups (2 lbs.)  black beluga lentils 
 1½ cups  vinaigrette  (see below) 
 1 cup (5 oz.) finely chopped  shallots 
 1 cup (6 oz.)  hazelnuts , roasted, skins rubbed off and coarsely chopped 
 4 tbsp. chopped  parsley 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper  to taste 
 Vinaigrette : 
 6 tbsp.  sherry vinegar 
 salt 
 1⅛ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 2 tsp.  Dijon mustard 
 Freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Rinse  Lentils  and pick over. 
 Place in a large saucepan and cover with 3 quarts cold  water . 
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer until tender, 10 to 20 minutes. 
 (Time depends on freshness of  Lentils ; new crop can cook fast, so test often.) 
 Drain  Lentils  and transfer to a large bowl.
