      Consommé     
 About consommé : 
 Clear French broth made of beef. 
 The term has been expanded to include most any clarified meat or fish broth. Consommé will get served hot or cold and is randomly used as a soup or sauce base. A double consommé has been reduced until it is half the volume (and has twice the flavor) of regular (or single) consommé.
