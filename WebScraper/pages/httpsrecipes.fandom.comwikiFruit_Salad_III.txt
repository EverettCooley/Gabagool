Ingredients : 
 1 pound dried  raisins 
 1 pound  papaya 
 1 pound  pineapple 
 mango 
 nuts  as desired ( walnuts , roasted  almonds ) 
 fresh and frozen fruits 
 Directions : 
 Add the above ingredients in a bowl. 
 Finish it off by adding fresh and frozen fruits. 
 berries  give it a lovely color, hard  apples  a nice crunch (don't use anything mealy),  kiwi  and/or  green grapes  for color,  star fruit  for eye appeal, etc. 
 Even when there isn't much fresh fruit available—or time to cut it up—frozen  berries  are nice. 
 It is best if it blends about an hour before serving but i would rather add the fresh/frozen fruit at the last minute (even if it is cut up ahead) than have it lose it's shape and eye-appeal by being mixed in too long. 
 I usually garnish it with the prettiest of the fresh fruit.
