A mixture, used as an alternative method of leavening, which contain flour, yeast and water. The mixture is left to ferment for two to five hours and at times, up to two weeks. When making bread, the starter is combined with the flour in the mixing stage. Using a starter results in airy, open textured bread with a better flavor. The longer the starter ferments, the better the flavor.
