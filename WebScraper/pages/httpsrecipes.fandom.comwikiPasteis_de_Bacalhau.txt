Description : 
 Portuguese cod cakes 
 
 This recipe taken from www.Portuguese-recipes.com 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb of  salt cod 
 4 large  potatoes  peeled and cut in quarters 
 3  eggs 
 ⅓ cup of  parsley  finely chopped 
 1 tbsp of  onion  finely chopped 
 ½ tsp  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Soak cod overnight. 
 The next day pour off old  water  and add new enough to cover the fish. 
 Bring to a boil. This reduces the amount of  salt  in the fish. 
 Taste a small sample of the fish, if it is still too salty change the  water  and boil again. 
 Meanwhile cook the  potatoes  until tender. 
 Mash the cod and the  potatoes  together. 
 Add the  eggs ,  parsley ,  onion , and  pepper  mix this well. 
 Shape into balls and flatten out to the shape of a patty. 
 Fry them in  oil  until golden brown all over. 
 Drain on paper towels. 
 Notes : 
 If the mix is to moist use a little  flour  to dry the mixture but not to much as you want them a little moist. If the mix is to dry use another  egg  to add moisture.
