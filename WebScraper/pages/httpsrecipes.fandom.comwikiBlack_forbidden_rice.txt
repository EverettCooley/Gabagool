 About Black forbidden rice : 
 Forbidden rice is a short-grained, heirloom rice that is black when raw and dark purple when cooked. The name comes from the legend that it was reserved for emperors in ancient China because of its nutritiousness and rarity. This grain is high in fiber and has a deep, nutty taste.Forbidden rice has recently appeared on the shelves of health food stores in the Western United States along with other heirloom rices such as Bhutanese Red Rice and Wild rice, particularly in California. It is popular with vegetarians and vegans because it has a favorable nutrition profile.The deep color of black forbidden rice suggests the presence of phytonutrients. It has a relatively high mineral content, including iron, and, like most rice, supplies several important amino acids. When it is prepared, forbidden rice has the smell of freshly popped popcorn and turns the water that it is boiling in a brilliant purple color. The grains of black forbidden rice are much longer than they are wide, and they grow even longer as they cook. They stay firm and separate, not sticky, after cooking. The best types of black forbidden rice are aged for several years before they are milled and sold.
