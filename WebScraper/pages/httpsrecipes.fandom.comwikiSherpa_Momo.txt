       Sherpa Momo     
 Description : 
 Tibetan chicken or vegetable filled dumplings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Meat filling : 
 4  chicken  breast halves, meat removed and minced 
 2 minced  onions 
 5 cloves  garlic  (or to taste), diced 
 1 large piece  ginger  to taste, diced 
 1-2 tablespoons  soy sauce 
 salt , paper and accent to taste 
 1 teaspoon  garam masala  optional 
 a little  oil  or  ghee  ( clarified butter ) to moisten - mix these ingredients together well 
 Vegetable Filling : 
 3-4 cups vegetables, finely chopped and lightly steamed:
 onion 
 cabbage 
 green beans 
 cauliflower 
 garlic  to taste 
 ginger  to taste 
 soy sauce  to taste 
 salt  to taste 
 1 teaspoon  garam masala 
 optional: a little  oil  or  ghee  ( clarified butter ) to moisten 
 Dough : 
 3-4 cups  flour 
 cold  water 
 Directions : 
 Dough : 
 Mix  flour  and cold  water  to make a smooth dough 
 knead lightly and break off small pieces, rolling each into a thin round about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. 
 Meat filling : 
 Mix all ingredients together well 
 Vegetable Filling : 
 Finely chop and lightly steam or blanch the vegetables until slightly limp 
 season with minced  garlic ,  ginger ,  soy sauce ,  salt  and  garam masala 
 optional: a little  oil  or  ghee  ( clarified butter ) to moisten 
 Momos : 
 Put a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the middle of each dough round. 
 Form the momo in any of the following traditional shapes, using one hand to pleat or pinch and the other to both hold the momo and keep the filling from oozing out:
 Eight-pleated half moon shape; 
 Six-pleated round shape, with the pleats in the center like a top-knot; 
 The nine-pleated half moon shape with the ends brought around to almost touch; or the fluted half moon shape in which the ends have been brought around and pinched together to form a circle. 
 Arrange on a steamer coated with  vegetable oil spray  and steam, covered l0-15 minutes. 
 Serve with a dipping sauce. (I like soy sauce mixed with a little  rice vinegar  and  sugar  or  chilli  paste.)
