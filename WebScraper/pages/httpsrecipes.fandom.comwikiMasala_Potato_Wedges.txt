 Description : 
 If you like to snack on "chips" - or you need an alternative vegetable or carbohydrate accompaniment to your main dish - whether it be Indian style or not - then why not try home-made  Potato  wedges? I know a lot of people who buy  Potato  wedges in packets from Safeway or Marks & Spencer - and I often wonder why people would sacrifice the simply-gained pleasure of cooking them instead. After all - it's not as if it's hard.

       Ingredients     
 Just get together some  potatoes  - any sort will do really. I had to use up some that were starting to develop shoots in my cupboard. Because of this - and also because the skin on them was not really that good for leaving on - I peeled mine - but the wedges will turn out better if you don't peel the skin. 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 You can use whatever spices you like. Iused the ones shown in the above pic. You could use other spices instead - e.g.  paprika  - or cajun style - or jerk- Chicken  seasoning - or you could use dried herbs instead - say mixed herb - or  oregano  - or even use  garlic salt  - or simply just  salt  and  black pepper . It's entirely up to you. (God I hate being so patronising.)
 Just wash the  potatoes  - and (if you are leaving the skin on) then simply cut them up into wedges. For medium sized  potatoes  I cut them in half along their longest length - and then cut them into long strips about 3Â cm thick - and then cut these again in half along their width.
 Put all the  potatoes  into a mixing bowl. Pour on some  vegetable oil  - over the  potatoes  - doesn't matter if not all the  potatoes  get coated - you will be mixing them all up in the next step. Pour on about 2 tablespoons worth of  oil . Then add the spices - and simply stir it all up until all the wedges are coated in the oily spice mixture.
 
       Spinkle spices onto potatoes     
         Pour on some vegetable oil and stir thoroughly untill well coated     
 Then lay out the uncooked wedges onto a hot baking tray (preheat the oven to 190 celcius) - and stick the tray in the oven to let them roast for about 25 mins - then take them out - turn all the wedges over (which should be browned on the underside by then) and roast for a further 20 mins or so. When the wedges look done - tase one - and if it's soft inside then it's done. Just serve up and eat!
 
         Lay out onto baking tray and roast in oven - turning once     
           
 You could serve the wedges with a salad if you like - or simply eat them with a dip or chutney - or  ketchup . If you regularly buy  Potato  wedges from Marks & Spencer - then try this - just once. You will never go back to supermarket ready-cook  potatoes  again!
