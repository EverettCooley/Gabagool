      Schnapps     
 American schnapps  are alcoholic beverages that are produced by mixing neutral grain spirit with fruit flavors or with other flavors. This mixture is then bottled with added sugar and (usually) glycerine, producing a smooth, syrup-like drink. Their alcohol content can be anywhere between 15% and 50% ABV (30–100 proof).
 American schnapps can be bought in a very wide variety of flavors, including aniseed, apricot, banana, blackberry, blueberry, black currant (aka crème de cassis), butterscotch, cherry, cinnamon, coffee, lemon, mandarin orange, menthol mint, peach, peppermint, root beer, and sour apple (and probably many more)
 These drinks technically fall into the category of liqueurs because of their added sugar content.
