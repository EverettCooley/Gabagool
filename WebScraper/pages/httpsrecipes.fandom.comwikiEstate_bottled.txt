      Estate Bottled     A wine label term indicating that 100 percent of the grapes that went into that wine were grown in the winery's own vineyards, or from vineyards (in the same Appellation) controlled by the winery through a long-term lease. Furthermore, such wines must be vinified and bottled at that winery. The term chateau bottled has a comparable meaning. Both refer to a wine that's considered to be of superior quality and character.
