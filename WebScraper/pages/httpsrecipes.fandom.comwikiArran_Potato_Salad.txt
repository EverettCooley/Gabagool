Description : 
       Arran Potato Salad     
 Although Ayrshire is traditionally the county where the best  potatoes  are grown, Arran Chief is a particularly good, waxy variety, ideal for salads. Of course, you can use any available variety which produces a firm, waxy texture when cooked.
 
 Ingredients : 
 10 waxy  potatoes , diced 
 4 ounces (100 g) shelled fresh  peas  (or frozen  peas ) 
 4 ounces cooked  beetroot  (red beets) diced 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 2 teaspoons chopped  onion 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh  parsley 
 4 tablespoons (60 ml)  salad dressing  or salad  cream 
 fresh  parsley  to garnish 
 Directions : 
 Boil the  potatoes  in salted  water  for ten minutes or until tender. 
 Drain and pat dry. 
 Cook the  peas  separately for about five minutes or until tender and then drain. 
 While the vegetables are still warm, mix together and stir in the chopped  parsley  and  onion  and season with  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Fold in the  salad dressing  (or salad  cream ) to moisten, and garnish with sprigs of fresh  parsley .
