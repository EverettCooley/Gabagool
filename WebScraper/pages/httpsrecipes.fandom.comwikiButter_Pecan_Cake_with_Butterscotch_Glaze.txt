Butter Pecan Cake with Butterscotch Glaze
 1 package (18 ounces) butter pecan cake mix with pudding
1 package (3.4 ounces) instant butterscotch pudding mix
4 large eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
 Butterscotch Glaze:
1/4 cup milk
4 Tablespoons butter
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup butterscotch chips
 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and place a rack in the center of 
the oven. Generously grease a 12-cup Bundt pan with solid vegetable 
shortening, and dust the pan with flour. Shake out the excess flour. 
Set the pan aside.
 2. Place the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, sour cream, oil, water and 
pecans in a large mixing bowl. Blend on low speed for 30 seconds. 
Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase the mixer speed to 
medium, and continue blending until the batter is thick and well 
combined, 2 minutes more. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and 
place the pan in the oven.
 3. Bake the cake until the batter begins to pull away from the sides 
of the pan, and the top is deep brown, 60 to 65 minutes. Remove the 
pan from the oven, and let it cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run 
a sharp knife around the edges of the cake, shake the pan to loosen 
the cake, then invert it onto a plate to complete cooling.
 4. For the glaze, place the milk and butter in a small saucepan over 
medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring. Remove the pan from the heat 
and whisk in the sugar. Add the butterscotch chips. Stir with a 
wooden spoon until the chips have melted. Spoon the glaze over the 
cake, let the glaze set 15 minutes, then slice and serve.
