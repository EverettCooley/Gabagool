 Ingredients : 
 3/4 cup heavy cream 
 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

 1 (4 oz.) bar of baking white chocolate, chopped 
 1/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt 
 Directions : 
       White Chocolate Mousse With Raspberry Sauce     
 Whip heavy cream in electric mixer for about 1 minute. Mix in vanilla and stevia extract until stiff peaks form. Melt white chocolate in microwave at 50% power for about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir white chocolate until completely dissolved. Add to half of cream/stevia mixture and blend. Refrigerate the white chocolate/cream mixture in one bowl and the remaining whipped cream in a separate bowl for about 15 minutes. 
 Remove bowls from fridge and add yogurt to remaining whipped cream and whip with electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold yogurt/cream mixture into white chocolate/cream mixture. Place in dessert cups or ramekins and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Keep up to 2 days in refrigerator. 
 Optional: Drizzle with  Raspberry Sauce . Excellent!
