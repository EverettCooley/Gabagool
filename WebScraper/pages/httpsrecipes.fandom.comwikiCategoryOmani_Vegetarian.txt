 Traditional Omani cuisine is often adjusted to fit lacto-ovo-vegetarian demands. Although meat plays an important role in most Omani dishes, it is possible to find excellent vegetarian cooking in Oman. Soups can be adjusted to fit vegetarian standards and some of the traditional meat dishes were adapted to this eating style. Mushroom stews and mashed potatoes are among the most common Omani vegetarian dishes. Salads are, of course, suited for a vegetarian regime, and you will find excellent vegetable assortments, such as salads containing radishes, green lettuce, tomatoes and carrots. Although most Omani restaurants donâ€™t have a special vegetarian menu, you will notice that most of them are very happy to shape a particular dish to suit your demands.
