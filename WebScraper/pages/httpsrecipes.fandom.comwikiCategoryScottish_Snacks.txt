 Scottish snacks are usually consumed before an important meal, like appetizers. The Scottish traditional cuisine contains hundreds of Scottish recipe snacks. Snacks are eaten between the three meals of the day or when replacing dinner for example, because they are light dishes. Many snacks are rich in fibers, giving a plus of energy, so they are often consumed in small amounts so as not to ruin the appetite for a main meal. Scottish snacks can be served hot or cold. The Scottish snacks are easy to prepare and the time preparation is quite short if you follow the recipe. If you donâ€™t have the right ingredients you always can use substitutes that will not modify the taste.
