Ingredients : 
 2 cup cooked  garbanzo beans 
 2 tbsp  sesame oil 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 1 tbsp raw  sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 Mash garbanzos well with wooden spoon. 
 Stir in  oil  until the consistency is spreadable (you may need slightly less or more  oil  depending on the moisture content of the  chickpeas  (adding additional  water  instead of  oil  works just as well). 
 Add  salt  and  sesame seeds  and blend thoroughly. 
 This can be stored in a jar in the refrigerator for several days and used as a spread on bread.
