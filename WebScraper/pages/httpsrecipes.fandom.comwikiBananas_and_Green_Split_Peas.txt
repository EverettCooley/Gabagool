 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups dried green split  Peas , pre-soaked 
 4 ripe  bananas 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 2 tblsp.  palm oil , or other cooking  oil 
 1 very small  Onion , thinly sliced 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  Peas  in enough  water  to cover until tender, about 1Â½ hours. Peel  bananas  and lay them whole on top of the  Peas  without mixing. Continue to cook for about 10 minutes until  bananas  are soft, adding a bit of  water  if necessary to prevent  Peas  from sticking to the bottom of the pot. 
 Meanwhile, heat the  palm oil  in a skillet or pot large enough to hold the  Peas  and  bananas . Brown the  onions . Then with a slotted spoon, remove  bananas  and  Peas  from the first pot and add to the  onions . Sprinkle in the  salt  and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring gently but constantly, until  oil  has been absorbed. Serve hot. 
 Serves 6 - 8.
