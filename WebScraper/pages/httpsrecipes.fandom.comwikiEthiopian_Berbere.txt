Description : 
 Most of these spices can be found at an Indian or middle eastern market; hopefully there is one near you. The best way to grind those spices is with a coffee grinder. If you don't have one of those handy, using a blender set on "liquify" works pretty well too. I have tried grinding a batch of  garam masala  with a mortar and pestle, and i had to give up and resort to a blender because it would have taken me hours otherwise.
 
 Ingredients : 
 10  dried red chiles 
 ½ tsp  coriander seeds 
 5  cloves 
 seeds from 6  green cardamom  pods 
 ¼ tsp  ajowan seeds 
 8  allspice   berries 
 ½ tsp  black peppercorns 
 ½ tsp  fenugreek seeds 
 1 small piece of  cinnamon 
 ½ tsp ground  ginger 
 Directions : 
 Heat a heavy frying pan (without  oil ) and put in the chilies and other whole spices after 2–3 minutes. 
 Dry roast over a medium heat until they darken, stirring frequently to prevent burning. 
 Leave the spices to cool, then remove and discard the seeds from the chilies and crumble the chilies into the mixture. 
 Grind everything, including the  ginger , to a fine powder, and store in an airtight container for up to four months.
