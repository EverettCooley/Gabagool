Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays; I almost never make these cookies except at Christmas time. They just seem to be Christmas cookies. I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's Day for my then-fiancé. I usually make these cookies in Christmas shapes and frost them with green and red frosting. This is a good recipe for kids to help out with. It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you are cutting shapes. It cuts much better when it is cold. These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.
