Ingredients : 
 2 x 1 oz squares  unsweetened chocolate 
 ½ cup  butter 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 1  egg 
 2 cups  cake flour 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1 cup  milk chocolate  or  white chocolate chips  or a mixture 
 1 cup seedless  raspberry preserves 
 Directions : 
 Melt  chocolate  in top of a double boiler over hot not boiling  water . 
 Remove from heat and cool. 
 Cream  butter  and  sugar  in a large bowl until light. 
 Add  egg  and melted  chocolate ; beat until fluffy. 
 Stir in  cake flour ,  vanilla  and  salt  until well blended. 
 Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hr. 
 Preheat oven to 400°F. 
 Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. 
 Divide dough into 4 equal parts and divide each part into two pieces. 
 Roll each piece into a rope 12" long on a lightly floured board. 
 The ropes should be about the thickness of a finger. 
 Place 2" apart on the prepared cookie sheets. 
 With your finger tip, make an indentation along the length of each rope. 
 Bake 8 minutes or until firm. 
 Meanwhile melt the  chocolate chips  in a small bowl over hot  water . 
 If you are using both kinds of  chocolate , melt separately. 
 Stir until smooth. 
 Stir preserves and spoon them into a pastry bag fitted with a ¼" tip. 
 You can use a plastic bag with a corner snipped off with scissors. 
 When you remove the cookies from the oven, press preserves down the indentation in each cookie strip. 
 Return to the oven for 2 minutes and remove to wire racks. 
 While cookies are still warm, drizzle melted  chocolate  over the tops and cut into 1" diagonal pieces. 
 Refrigerate until the  chocolate  has set.
