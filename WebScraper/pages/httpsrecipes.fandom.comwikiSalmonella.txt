Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Salmonella

A strain of bacteria that can enter the human system through contaminated water or food such as meat or poultry, and eggs with cracked shells. Touching salmonella-carrying foods or unwashed surfaces (like cutting boards) that have had contact with them can contaminate other foods. The presence of salmonella is difficult to detect because it gives no obvious warnings (such as an off smell or taste). The bacteria can cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fever and chills. It can attack in as little time as 6 to 7 hours or take as long as 3 days. It seldom causes death and can be cured with antibiotics.
