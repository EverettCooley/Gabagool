      Clafouti     Originally from the Limousin region, this country-French dessert is made by topping a layer of fresh fruit with batter. After baking it's served hot, sometimes with cream. Some clafoutis have a cake like topping while others are more like a pudding. Though cherries are traditional, any fruit such as plums, peaches or pears can be used.
