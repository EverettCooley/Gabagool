The pork is tumbled in brine overnight, then placed in a mould before cooking and smoking the ham for more than five hours over beechwood chippings to give Waitrose Brusnswick smoked ham its characteristic strong, rich pork flavour.
 Uses: Brunswick smoked ham can be used to replace bacon in a wide variety of recipes - from quiches and pies to pasta sauces.
