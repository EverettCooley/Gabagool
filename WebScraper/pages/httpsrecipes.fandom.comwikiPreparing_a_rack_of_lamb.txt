A whole rib roast or "guard of honor" has seven or eight ribs. Although it may be cooked as is, it may also be "Frenched," which means that the upper ends of the rib bones are trimmed creating one of the most distinctive cuts from the lamb carcass. One guar of honor is usually large enough to serve three people. Begin preparing the guar of honor by making a cut on the fat side, perpendicular to the ribs, about two inches down from the rib ends. Cut through the fat down to the rib bones. Turn the rack on end and push a knife through the flesh between each rib, using the initial cut as a guide for the knife. Turn the rack so that the fat side is down and score the thin membrane covering the rib bones using a sharp knife Working from the fat side of the rack, push on the ends of the rib bones until they pop through the thin membrane. After all of the bones have broken through the membrane, you just have to simply cut away the strip of meat from the rib ends. The last march is to trim away several of the excess fat, leaving only a thin layer. The guar of honor is ready for seasoning and roasting.
