 Time: 40 minutes 
 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 large  onion , chopped 
 3 medium baking  potatoes , peeled and cut into Â½-inch cubes 
 4 cups  fish  or  chicken stock , preferably warmed 
 24 hard-shell  clams , shucked and with their juice; or about 1 pint undrained shucked clams, cut up if very large; or about 2 cups diced or cut-up fresh delicate  white fish , such as  cod 
 2 cups  corn  kernels, preferably fresh 
 1 cup  low-fat milk 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper  to taste

 Directions : 
 Place the oil in a large, deep saucepan or casserole and turn the heat to medium. 
 A minute later, add the onion and potatoes. 
 Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and the potato lightly browned, about 10 minutes. 
 Add the stock to the potatoes and onion and cook over medium-low heat until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes (you may prepare the soup in advance up to this point. Cover, refrigerate for up to 2 days, and reheat before proceeding). 
 Add the clams or fish chunks and corn and cook about 5 minutes. 
 Add the milk, then salt and plenty of pepper. 
 Garnish and serve.
