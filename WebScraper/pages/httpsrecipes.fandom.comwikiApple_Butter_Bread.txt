Description : 
 This makes a heavy moist  bread  that is delicious. Any kind of  nuts  can be used and any kind of dried fruit that your prefer. This can be sugar-free using Splenda brown sugar blend and  Margo's apple butter recipe  using Splenda.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour  (i used half  whole wheat flour ) 
 1 cup  brown sugar 
 1½ teaspoons  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  baking soda 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1½ cups  apple butter  (divided) 
 ½ cup  apple juice 
 ¼ cup  butter , melted 
 1  egg , beaten 
 1 cup  raisins  (optional) 
 ½ cup chopped  walnuts 
 Directions : 
 Combine  flour ,  brown sugar ,  baking powder ,  baking soda  and  salt  in a large mixing bowl. 
 In a small bowl mix ¾ cup  apple butter ,  apple juice ,  butter  and  egg  together. 
 Fold in the  raisins  and chopped  nuts . 
 Add the  apple butter  mixture to the dry ingredients and blend together. 
 Pour half the mixture in a loaf pan that has been sprayed with  cooking spray . 
 Gently spread the reserved ¾ cup  apple butter  over the batter. 
 Pour the rest of the batter over the  apple butter  mixture and spread evenly over the top to cover. 
 Bake at 350 °F for 55 to 65 minutes or until done. 
 To bake "my mistake loaf" just put all the  apple butter  in the wet ingredients and blend into the dry ingredients. 
 I cut up  dried pineapple  pieces and added with the  nuts  instead of the  raisins . 
 Pour the whole batter into the loaf pan and bake as above.
