 About shrimp paste : 
 Southeast Asian shrimp paste, known variously as  terasi ,  trasi ,  bagoong , and  trassi , comes in cakes that can range from soft and grayish-pink to firm and brownish in color. Shrimp paste is made by grinding up salted, fermented shrimp and has a strong, salty, fishy flavor. It is used  sparingly  in myriad Asian preparations, particularly soups, sauces, and rice dishes. The pungent odor, common to all the shrimp pastes, dissipates somewhat during cooking.
 It may also be crushed with spices, grilled or fried before adding to other ingredients.
