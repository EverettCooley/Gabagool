Ingredients : 
 3¾ cups white  flour 
 2 cups  sugar 
 2 teaspoons  butter 
 1 teaspoon  yeast  diluted in a little warm  water 
 1¼ cup  milk  (or you can combine one cup  coconut milk , and ¼ cup  milk  or plain  yoghurt ) 
 ½ to 1 teaspoon ground  cardamon  seeds (you could also use  cardamon  powder but the fresh seeds are preferred) 
 Directions : 
 In a bowl, sift the  flour  and  sugar  together, add  cardamon  seeds and mix the dry ingredients. 
 Rub in the  butter . 
 In another bowl, mix the liquids ( yoghurt ,  milk ,  coconut milk , and  yeast  and  water  mixture) make a hole in the dry ingredients and pour in the liquids, stirring and making a dough that is not too stiff (you can use the bread machine to knead dough). The dough should be smooth. 
 Wrap in saran wrap or wet cloth and leave in a warm place to rise for 3 – 4 hours until the dough has doubled in size. 
 Put dough in a floured board and cut into 4 – 6 balls. 
 Roll out the balls into circles and cut into desired shapes (diamond shapes or triangles etc.) 
 Leave the cut shapes covered with a warm cloth or plastic wrap for about 1 – 2 hours. 
 Heat cooking  oil  in a fryer, pan or sufuria until hot. 
 Test for readiness by dipping a small piece of dough. 
 It should puff up and rise to the surface. 
 Fry your mahamris and drain on a paper towel. 
 Serve with tea, as a snack or even accompaniment to the main meal. 
 Enjoy!
