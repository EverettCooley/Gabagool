 Snacks are not a big part of the traditional eating habits in Senegal, however restaurants in this country have adapted to the demands of the international culinary eating habits and you will have a good list of appetizers and snacks to choose from in any restaurant in Senegal. In most cases, you will notice that the snacks are simply smaller, less nutritious derivates of different traditional dishes. Unique and interesting snacks that blend a traditional African cuisine style and modern influences from different Asian or European countries can however start off any meal served in Senegal with a very interesting experience. Exotic looking dishes like fish madlenes or combinations of herbs and spices that you wouldnâ€™t have thought of can often play the role of snacks or appetizers.
