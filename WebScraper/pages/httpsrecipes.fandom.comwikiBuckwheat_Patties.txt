 Ingredients : 
 # 1 1/2 cups cooked  Buckwheat 
 # 3-4 cloves minced  garlic 
 # 1 finely chopped  green onion 
 egg  Replacer for 1  egg 
 salt  to taste 
 pepper  to taste 
 Variation 1: prepared horseradish, vegan  worcestershire sauce ,  paprika ,  red wine vinegar 
 Variation 2:  ketchup , herbs of choice 
 vegan bread crumbs 
 olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Buckwheat  can be cooked with a 2:1 liquid to dry ratio. 
 
 
 Combine  Buckwheat ,  garlic ,  green onions  and  salt / pepper  to taste. Add ingredients for variation 1 or 2 to taste [i.e. the last time I made this I used 2 capfuls of W. sauce, 1 1/2 tsp horseradish, 1 capful of vegan  red wine vinegar  and 1/2 tsp  paprika ). Mix well. Add the Ener-G  egg  Replacer and mix. Add enough vegan bread crumbs so that you can form patties in your hand (it should be moist but not wet). If you find you made it too dry, just add a little bit of  water  until you get the consitency you want. 
 
 
 Heat  olive oil  in a frying pan. 'Cook' the patties a couple of minutes until they are golden brown on each side. Serve as sandwiches or as a meal complement.
