Corny Treats The rainy season is when corn makes its appearance on street corners. Here are some corn recipes that you can turn out in quick time.
 
  If the monsoon is here, can the bhutta or corn be far behind? You can find bhutta vendors on every street corner, roasting the cobs over red hot coals in their sigdis. They take a slice of lemon, dip it in salt and chilli power and rub it over the roasted bhutta, for a quick, mouth-watering snack.
 
  But that�s not the only way you can enjoy the goodness of corn. You can also turn out some delicious corn dishes at home � roasted, grilled or steamed. Corn is good for you; it contains dietary fibre, helps neutralise stomach acids and has antiviral properties.
 The best way to check for freshness is to ensure that the kernels are firm and fleshy, without any indentations. The husk should be evenly green, and the tip shouldn�t be dark.
 Here are some healthy corn dishes that you can turn out in a jiffy.
