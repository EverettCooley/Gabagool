 Wikipedia Article  About Unsweetened chocolate on Wikipedia 
 Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavour. With the addition of sugar, however, it is used as the base for cakes, brownies, confections, and cookies.
 Also known as baker's chocolate or bitter chocolate. In the U.S. unsweetened chocolate is usually packaged in bars which can be broken into squares (1 square= 1 US oz).
