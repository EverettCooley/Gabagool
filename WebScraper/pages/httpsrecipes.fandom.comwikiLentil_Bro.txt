Description : 
 The Shetland Islands' proximity to Scandinavia is evident in its traditional celebration "Up-Helly-A", during which the Shetland inhabitants, dressed as  Vikings, carry a long-boat through the streets of Lerwick and later set it on fire! Norse influence is also evident in the food traditions of the Shetlanders.
