Description : 
 Hellenic (Greek) country salad. To many, this is known as kalokerini salata, a Greek summer salad. For others, it is a colorful 
salad that may have first been tasted in a local Greek restaurant. It is wonderful and easy to make, especially when garden vegetables are at  their prime. For best results, always use feta cheese and Kalamata olives.
