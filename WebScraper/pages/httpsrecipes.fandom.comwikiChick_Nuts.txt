 Ingredients : 
 ·	1 (1 lb) package dried garbanzo beans
·	For CHICK DEVILS: -  Cayenne  and  salt  to taste
·	For RED CHICKS: -  paprika  and  garlic salt  to taste
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Chickpeas  are soaked overnight itself. On the very next day, they are drained and patted to enable them to dry. Now place the  Chickpeas  in a single layer on a cookie tray. And bake at 350 °F for about 45 minutes or until they become crisp. The  Chickpeas  will shrink back to their original size. Now you can add the flavors of your choice and toss to mix while still hot or let the  Chickpeas  cool down and serve them plain. After seasoning the  Chickpeas , allow them to air dry for a few days to ensure that any residual moisture has evaporated.
