Description : 
       Brioche braid     
 Makes 1 loaf. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 package  active dry yeast 
 ¾ cup warm  water 
 2 tablespoons  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 3 cups  unbleached flour 
 3  eggs 
 ½ cup soft  butter 
 1 cup diced  fontina ,  Gruyère  or  Jarlsberg  cheese (optional) 
 Method : 
 Sprinkle the yeast into warm water in a large mixing bowl. 
 Let stand until puffy. 
 Add sugar, salt, and one cup of flour; beat well. 
 Add three eggs, one at a time. Beat until smooth. 
 Beat in the butter and gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. 
 Turn out on a floured board. Knead until smooth and satiny. 
 Place in a greased bowl. 
 Butter the top of dough lightly. Cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. 
 Mix in the cheese if used and turn out on a floured board. Knead lightly. 
 Divide into three pieces and shape into long ropes; braid the strands and tuck ends under. 
 Place on a greased baking sheet and cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown, and the loaf sounds hollow when thumped.
