 Notes : 
 Gluten in  oats : There is evidence that some celiacs can tolerate small amounts of the type of gluten found in  Oats . While research continues they should only be included in the celiac diet under medical and dietary supervision. If you cannot find dried  sour cherries , you can use any other dried fruit to your liking.
