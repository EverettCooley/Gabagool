 Description : 
 This dish is really tasty - and it's a lot easier than you think. Get the following ingredients together:
 
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2 cap fulls of yellow  daal   Lentils  (Moong  daal ) 
 1 or 2  onions  - finely chopped 
 2 teaspoons  salt . 
 1.5 teaspoon haldi ( turmeric ) 
 2 teaspoons  garam masala 
 2 teaspoons ground coriander 
 1.5 teaspoons ground  cumin 
 Chunks of  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie 
 Half tin of peeled chopped  tomatoes 
 A generous knob - of  butter ! 
 Some freshly chopped (or frozen chopped) coriander 
 
 
 
 
       Ingredients     
 moong dal  is the small- grain  yellow split  Lentils  that you can get in pretty much any Asian/Indian shop -and sometimes also at your local supermarket - e.g. Asda, Safeway etc. For this recipe - you need a couple of cap-fulls of the above style jar. I know I'm not being precise - but that is what Indian cooking is all about! Let's just say that the amount of  daal  you need is about three or four handfulls. Be careful - because by handful I don't mean "cupped" handful - I mean as much as you can pick with one hand - which, trust me, isn't a lot - as these  daal   grains  are quite small and will fall out of your hand just like sand does. Imagine it to be like  rice  - you only need a little to make quite a lot. I usually make enough to serve two or three people for today - and enough for two people in terms of leftovers for tomorrow. Make sure you wash the  daal  thoroughly - removing any loose husks or stones/dirt etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Put the washed  Lentils  into a large stove-top pot and add enough  water  to cover the  daal  about half an index finger in depth. You don't need to worry about adding too much  water  - as it will simmer and evaporate away anyway - and you will almost certainly need to add more  water  later on. The rest of the ingredients are fairly self-explanatory by now - especially if you have been following these recipes:
 
         Put everything except butter into pot     
         Stir it all up.Bring to boil     
 And here is why this recipe is so easy. Just throw in all the rest of the ingredients except the  butter . Make sure that the  onions  are finely chopped. Stir it all up and put on high flame and bring to the boil. Then turn down the flame (put the lid half-on) and keep the mixture simmering somewhat aggressively. You need to let it simmer for around 1.5 hours - stirring every 15 minutes or so - and adding more  water  if necessary. It will be necessary - as the mixture will lose a lot of  water  in the first 45 mins. So don't be afraid to add more  water  - you can always simmer off the  water  until you get the right thickness later on. Basically - you want to ensure that the  daal  gets to a thick-ish sort of consistency - and is to your liking. (I like mine to be a bit like the consitency around about just like the  Potato  and  leek  Covent Garden soup.) In the first 45 mintes - the mixture will froth a little - don't be put off by this - just stir it all up and keep it simmering - as I said - somewhat agressively.
 
         Pu lid half-on and let it simmer for around 1 hour 15 mins     
           
 After about an hour and a half it will be done! Taste it in order to see if any more  salt  or chillie powder needs adding - and make sure that the  Lentils  are soft and tender - and breaking up in a mushy fashion - not hard! Be sure at this point to add a big dollop of  butter . Melt it into the mixture - and stir it all about. This will thicken it and make the texture absolutely heavenly! Simmer it like this for about 15 more minutes - it will bubble in a gloopy style - and there should be no more "froth". Don't worry about overdoing it - it's better to overcook it than not. When it has acheived your preferred consistency - turn off the flame and sprinkle on a generous handful of freshly chopped  coriander leaf  and stir it in. Let it rest with the lid on for 5 minutes and it's ready to serve!
 This dish is best served on a bed of  basmati rice  - or in a deep bowl with some warmed wholemeal pitta bread, roti or toast - with a side salad of chunky  cucumber ,  tomato ,  Onion  with a dash of  lemon  or  vinegar . Very tasty - and very easy to make!
 Update: Somebody emailed me asking about "tarka  daal ". Well - the "tarka" is the fried  Onion /spice/ tomato  mixture that you typically start off with when cooking in Indian methods. You will notice that the above  daal  recipe involves no frying. (By the way - the lack of fried stuff in it is also a reason why this type of food is often prescribed by Indian mothers for not-feeling-to-well children. I remember when I was a kid - my mum would cook  daal  like this whenever I was recovering from sickness or bad flu etc.) Anyway - back to the point: so - this  daal  doesn't involve the "tarka" preparation stage. So - it is very common - especially when serving up the leftovers the next day - to "freshen" or "liven" the dish by creating a tarka in a separate pot (see the second half of the saag recipe for details on how to make the tarka - but for  daal  - use long thinly-sliced  Onion  instead of the finely chopped  Onion  used in the saag tarka) - and then just pour it into the  daal  when you are ready to serve up. Some people like to pour the tarka over the top of the  daal  - and leave it there as a kind of garnish as it is served up on the table. Only when the first person takes a helping is the tarka stirred up into the rest of the  daal .
