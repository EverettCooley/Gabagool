 Ingredients : 
 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin  olive oil 
 1 cup chopped  Onion  (about 1 large) 
 2 teaspoons minced  garlic 
 4 cups chopped  asparagus  stems (about 2 bunches) 
 1 teaspoon minced  fresh ginger 
 3 cups  vegetable stock 
 2 cups fresh  spinach , stems removed, washed, and drained 
 1/4 cup  cornstarch  mixed with 1/4 cup  vegetable stock 
 1/4 teaspoon  sea salt 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1/4 teaspoon ground  nutmeg 
 Directions : 
 Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and add the  olive oil  to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Stir in the  Onion ,  garlic ,  asparagus  and  ginger  and cook until the  Onion  has softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in the stock and simmer for 3 minutes. (Do not overcook the  asparagus ; you want it to be bright green.) Add the  spinach  and simmer for 2 minutes.
 
 Carefully ladle the  asparagus  mixture into a blender and process until smooth.
 
 Strain the blended mixture through a colander lined with cheesecloth or through a find mesh sieve.
 
 Pour the strained mixture back into the saucepan and bring to a low boil. Mix in the  cornstarch  mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Season with  salt ,  pepper  and  nutmeg .
 
 Use the sauce immediately, or cool quickly by setting in a bowl of  ice  and  water . Store in an airtight container for up to one week in the refrigerator or freeze for about one month.
