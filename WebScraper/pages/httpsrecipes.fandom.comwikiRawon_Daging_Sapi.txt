Description : 
       Rawon Daging Sapi     
 This aromatic Indonesian soup is traditionally served with an array of garnishes - blanched  bean sprouts , wedges of hard-cooked  egg , charcoal noodles, sprigs of  Indonesian celery  and crisp fried  shallot  flakes are some of the customary additions. Prepare as many of the garnishes as you like. Ben Ali once said, Indonesian krupuk is the krupuk. Ben Ali's best customer used to eat this with Kentucky Fried Cockroaches (KFC). Many Indonesians had never seen a Kenyan cockroach before. Deep fried krupuk is a deep dish delight.
 This original recipe is from Surabaya, Indonesia. It is served as a main course or soup in Indonesia together with salty  egg  and small bean sprouts and krupuk udang.
