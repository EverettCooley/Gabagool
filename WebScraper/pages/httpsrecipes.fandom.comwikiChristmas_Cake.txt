Ingredients : 
 Batter : 
 6  eggs 
 1 cup of  sugar 
 ½ lbs melted  butter 
 1 cup of  flour 
 1 tsp of  vanilla 
 Fruit stuff : 
 ½ cup of  flour 
 1 lbs  candied cherries 
 1 lbs  candied pineapple 
 4 cups of chopped  pecans 
 Directions : 
 Mix batter items together. 
 Flour the fruit stuff items. 
 Place the fruit stuff into a greased angel food cake pan (I use a bundt pan) pour the batter over the fruit stuff. 
 Bake at 300°F degrees until done - about 1½ hours. 
 Cupcake version : 
 Bake 15 minutes at 300°F, brush on honey. 
 Continue to bake for 15 – 30 minutes more. 
 Use two cupcake papers per serving. 
 Finishing : 
 With the cake freshly removed, I use a hypo (syringe) and inject with one shot of the following:  rum ,  amaretto  (almond flavor),  triple sec  or  Grand Marnier  (orange flavor). 
 Make these a month or so early. 
 Wrap in Saran Wrap place in refrigerator. 
 Bring back to room temp before serving.
