 Wikipedia Article  About Maillard reaction 
 "Browning" can refer to the Maillard reaction.
 The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between an amino acid and a reducing sugar, usually requiring the addition of heat. Like caramelization, it is a form of non-enzymatic browning. The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar interacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid, and interesting but poorly characterized odor and flavour molecules result. This reaction is the basis of the flavouring industry, since the type of amino acid determines the resulting flavour.
