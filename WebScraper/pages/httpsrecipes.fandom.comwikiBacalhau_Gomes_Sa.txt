 12 ==Directions== 
 Soak the dry  salt   Cod  in  water  overnight. The next day, drain fish and simmer in fresh  water , with  bay leaves , for 20 minutes. Save the cooking  water . 
 Meanwhile, in separate pots, boil the  potatoes  and hard-boil the  eggs . When  potatoes  are tender but not mushy, peel them and chop into chunks. Peel and slice the  eggs , and set them aside to be used as a garnish. 
 Using a large, heavy pot or skillet, preferably cast-iron, sauté  onions  and  garlic  in moderately hot  olive oil , stirring to prevent scorching. Add  pepper  and  oregano . Flake the  Cod  with a fork and mix it in gently, along with the  potatoes ,  green pepper  and  parsley . Reduce heat and cook for several minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. If the mixture threatens to dry out, moisten with the codfish-cooking  water . You may also add more  olive oil . (At this point, if your pot is not ovenproof, transfer the mixture to one that is.) 
 Garnish with and  egg  slices, and heat in a 350 °F oven until steaming hot.
