 Description : 
       Sopa de Topinambur     
 This unusual soup is good both hot and cold - but particularly hot, I think, when cold winds are blowing and these sunchokes start showing up in the market.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  Jersualem artichokes  (or "sunchokes") 
 1  onion  finely chopped 
 4 cup  vegetable stock  or  chicken stock 
 salt  to  taste 
 freshly-ground  white pepper  to taste 
 Â½ cup  heavy cream 
 Garnish : 
 1 to 2 tbsp minced  cilantro  or  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Peel the sunflower rhizomes and slice them thinly. 
 Put them in a medium saucepan with the  onion  and stock - bring to a boil and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes. 
 Puree in a blender, solids first, then pour back into the saucepan. 
 Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper , stir in the  cream , and reheat. 
 When ready to serve, ladle into individual bowls. 
 Pour 2 tablespoons of  cream  in the middle of each bowl and swirl in a figure eight. 
 Top with minced  cilantro  or  parsley .
