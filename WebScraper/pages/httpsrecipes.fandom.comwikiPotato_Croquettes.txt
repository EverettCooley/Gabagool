      Potato Croquettes     
 Ingredients : 
 750 g floury  potatoes , peeled and quartered 
 2 tablespoons  cream  or melted  butter 
 3  eggs 
 ¼ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 plain flour , for coating 
 1½ cups (150 g) dry  breadcrumbs , for coating 
 oil , for deep-frying 
 Directions : 
 Steam or boil the  potatoes  for 10 – 15 minutes, or until just tender 
 Drain well and return to the pan. 
 Stir over medium heat to remove excess moisture, then mash well. 
 Stir in the  cream  or melted  butter , one  egg , the  nutmeg  and some  salt  and freshly ground  black pepper . 
 Spread the  potato  onto a plate with a spoon, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 
 Divide the  potato  mixture into 12 evenly sized portions and form each one into a  sausage  shape about 8 cm long. 
 Place the  flour  and breadcrumbs into two separate shallow dishes. 
 Lightly bat the remaining  eggs  and pour into a shallow bowl. 
 Roll the croquettes in the  flour  and shake off the excess. 
 Dip in the beaten  egg , then coat evenly in the crumbs, shaking off the excess. 
 Place the croquettes in a single layer on a try or plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
 Fill a deep heavy-based pan a third full of  oil  and heat to 180°C (350°F) (a cube of bread dropped in the  oil  will brown in 15 seconds). 
 Cook the croquettes in batches for 5 minutes, or until golden. 
 Remove carefully with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels and keep warm while cooking the remaining croquettes.
