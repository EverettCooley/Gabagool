The kids will love this for their main meal too. This will take no longer than 15 minutes - and is made for two to share. Raid the fridge for the following:
 
       Recipe by Route 79     
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Directions : 
 You don't have to use precisely the above - but I can gaurantee you'll find the combination of all the above simply exquisite! The German-style  Sausage  should be the already-cooked ones that you find in the chiller-cabinets or deli in the supermarket - can be of any sort you like: smoked,  garlic ,  Lamb , veggie etc. or even use pepperoni instead. Make sure you keep a couple in your fridge all the time - they last ages due to them being vacuum-packed - and they come in real handy on occasions like this!
 I just love that horse-shoe shape that the Germans make their sausages! Just slice up the  Sausage  into the thickness of 1 centimetre. Heat up a couple of tablespoons of  oil  in frying pan - medium flame - and then add the  onions  and  Sausage  pieces. Stir it around so that all the  Sausage  pieces are flat in the pan - the objective is to lightly brown both surfaces of each  Sausage  piece - by which time the  Onion  should also be lightly browned too.
 
         Fry the onion and sausage slices in some oil together     
         Fry until onion and sausage are slightly browned     
 Then add the  Mushroom  pieces. Fry for a little more - these will cook quick and the pan should get a little liquidy due to the  water  coming out of the  Mushrooms . The objective here is to fry until all the  water  has evaporated - should only need a few minutes. Then add the chopped  tomato . Make sure you've removed the centre of the  tomato  - the pulp and seeds. As these will make the pan too wet. I take the middle out and eat it whilst preparing - I love  tomato ! My dad has a habit of putting lumps of  tomato  pulp mixed with  vinegar  into his glass of  Scotch   whiskey ! Everyone has a different use for  tomato  pulp I'm sure!
 
         Then add the mushrooms     
         Then add the tomato     
 Just fry the pan for a little more - this is the point that you add some  salt  and crushed  black pepper . Be generous with the  pepper  please! And then add the beaten  egg . Make sure the  egg  was beaten real good. It should be frothing before you pour it into the pan.
 
         Just fry ot all around for five minutes. Add some salt and pepper to the pan too     
         Then add the beaten egg     
 Now just let the  egg  cook from the bottom on medium flame. You will see the  egg  start to solidify and puff up a bit. Whilst you are doing this - put the grill on max heat. After a few minutes - put the frying pan under the grill - right up close to the grill element. This will make the omelette puff up in a way that just could never be acheived on the hob! (Be careful if your frying pan has a plastic handle - you don't want to melt it under the grill!)
 
 
         Cook the egg - let it go like omelette     
         Put the pan under hot grill to make the omelette really puff up good (This also cooks top of omelette)     
 Return the stove-top to finish it off - sprinkle some  coriander leaf  on top - and turn the heat right down to the lowest possible flam eon the smallest burner. This will keep the omelette warm whilst you make a couple of toast -  butter  them - and cut them into halves.
 
         Return to stove top flame to finish off. Doesn't it look good?. Sprikle some frsh coriander on top to add a great flavour     
 Place two halves of toast onto each of two large plates - and then cut the omelette in the pan into four quarters using the edge of the wooden spoon/spatula. It should cut really effortlessly. Slide each quarter of omelette onto the plates straight from the pan - two on each plate - on top of the toast - arranged in a buttterfly fashion.
 
         Cut into quarters.Get two plates.Make two toasts-butter them.Put one on each plate and serve up two quarters of the omelette per plate. Splash some tabasco sauce over it and eat!     
 Now all you have to do splash a bit of  Tabasco sauce  over it - and eat! Enjoy!
 I will leave you with some arty pictures of this dish to make your mouth  water :
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
