 About Swedish brown bean : 
 The Swedish brown bean is relatively small and ovoid, with a pale brown to tan color. The beans are known for being extremely tender with a nutty flavor, and they hold together well, even through extended cooking. This last trait makes Swedish brown beans especially popular in soups and stews, as cooks do not need to worry about the beans breaking apart if they are a little bit overcooked.
