 1 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 12 large  egg whites , room temperature 
 1 Tbs. fresh  lemon juice 
 3 tsp.  vanilla extract

 3 1/2 oz. dark chocolate- orange  bars, such as Newman’s Own Organics Dark Chocolate-

 In large grease-free bowl, using an electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat  egg whites  until frothy. Add  lemon juice  and beat until soft peaks form. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1 cup  Sugar  over whites, 1/4 cup at a time, and beat at medium speed 1 to 2 minutes. Sift 1/4 cup of  flour  mixture over whites and gently fold in using a rubber spatula. Add  vanilla  and  orange peel . Alternately fold in remaining  flour  mixture and grated  chocolate  until well blended. (Be sure to fold gently to avoid deflating  egg whites .)
