 Serves 6 
 Ingredients : 
 2 thick naganegi (or  leeks ) 
 ⅚ cup (200 cc)  water 
 1 teaspoon  gelatin 
 ½  chicken bouillon  cube 
 2 tablespoons fresh  cream 
 1 tablespoon  mayonnaise 
 dash  sugar 
 3½ ounces (100g)  crabmeat , cooked and shredded 
 Directions : 
 Cut the naganegi into 1½ inch (4 cm) lengths, and add to a saucepan of boiling water for 6 to 7 minutes, until they are slightly soft. 
 Drain and cool. 
 When cool, push out and remove the centers, leaving only about 2 layers of skin. 
 Combine the water, gelatin, and bouillon cube in a small microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave for 1 minute. 
 Take out 2⅔ tablespoons (40 cc) of the gelatin liquid and place it in a separate small mixing bowl, add the fresh cream, mayonnaise, sugar and crabmeat, and mix. 
 Set this bowl into a larger bowl of ice to chill. 
 When the mixture has jelled, use it to stuff the naganegi pieces. 
 Refrigerate the remaining gelatin mixture for about 2 hours. 
 When chilled, spread it over a serving plate, and arrange the stuffed naganegi on top.
