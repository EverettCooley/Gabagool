Cane vinegar, made from sugar-cane juice, is most popular in the Philippines (where it is called  sukang iloko ), although it is also produced in France and the United States. It ranges from dark-yellow to golden-brown in color and has a mellow flavor, similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat "fresher" taste. Contrary to the expectation, it is never sweeter than other vinegars, then containing no residual sugar.       Cane Vinegar
