SCALLOPED CORN CASSEROLE
 12 strips bacon, fried crisp
4-6 tablespoons bacon grease
1 large green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 cans (15&1/2 ounces each) cream style corn -OR- 3 cups fresh corn 
mixed with 1 cup milk or cream (I've never done the fresh corn 
version)
1&1/2 cups fine bread crumbs
2 large eggs, beaten
1&1/2 cups light cream (like half and half)
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
butter
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F) and grease a casserole dish with 
butter.
 In a large, deep skillet, fry bacon and when cooked, remove from 
grease. When bacon is cool, break into small pieces/crumbles.
 Using 4-6 tablespoons of bacon grease, saute green pepper and onion 
for 4-5 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. 
 Add corn, bread crumbs, beaten egg, light cream, salt, and pepper.
 Pour into casserole dish.
 Sprinkle bacon over the top and dot top of corn with plenty of butter.
 Bake for appoximately 25 minutes, until very hot and bubbly all the 
way through. Should be nicely browned.
