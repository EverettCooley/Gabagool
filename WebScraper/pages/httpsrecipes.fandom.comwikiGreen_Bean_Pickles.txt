      Green bean pickles     
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb fresh  green beans , cleaned and kept whole 
 1 cup  vinegar  (I used  wine vinegar ) 
 1 cup  water 
 1 Tbsp  mustard seeds 
 1 Tbsp fresh  dill   or  1 tsp dry 
 2 – 3 cloves  garlic , minced ( or  ½ tsp  garlic powder ) 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 cayenne pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Put all in a big pot with a lid. Bring to a boil, turn down heat and let simmer for 10 – 15 minutes or to your desired degree of tender-crispness. I let them go until they just turn that army green color. 
 Keep in tightly closed container (plastic or glass preferably) in the refrigerator. They keep about a week or so and improve in flavor. Make sure you put the  beans  and juice in the container or they will dry out.
