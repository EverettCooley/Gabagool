 Description : 
This simplified bread dish is made and packed with real pepproni, herbs, and cheese, and delivers a rich, meaty flavor. Italian seasoning sometimes and chili oil sometimes work for this, too.       Pepperoni Bread     
 Ingredients : 
 1 loaf frozen white bread dough 
 ½ tsp. vegetable shortening 
 ¾ tsp. fresh chopped parsley or parsley flakes 
 ¾ tsp. oregano 
 4 tsp. chili flakes, optional 
 4 oz. thinly sliced pepperoni 
 2 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese  or  (3 cups grated Colby or fresh Parmesan) 
 Directions : 
 Spread the shortening over the frozen dough. 
 Place dough in a plastic bag and fasten. Let thaw and rise for 7-8 hours. 
 Remove bread from the bag and spread dough on a 10x15-inch no-stick sheet. Sprinkle parsley, chili flakes (optional), and oregano over the dough. 
 Cover dough entirely with the sliced pepperoni leaving ¼-inch on each side uncovered. 
 Top with the Mozzarella. Roll up lengthwise. 
 Pinch the seam together. 
 Place seam-side down and prick the top with a kitchen knife. 
 Bake 350° F for 20-25 minutes. Let it set for 5 minutes. 
 Cut into ¾-inch slices after taking it out of the oven. Serve warm and plain or with any side dish, main dish, or appetizer.
