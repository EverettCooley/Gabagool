 Ingredients : 
 Garlic mayonnaise : 
 2  eggs 
 pinch of  salt 
 ¼ tsp  dry mustard 
 dash of  paprika 
 4 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1½ cups  olive oil 
 ½ head roasted  garlic 
 Salad : 
 3 lbs  russet potatoes 
 6 hard-boiled  eggs 
 ½ medium  red onion , minced 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 ¼ cup dried  dill 
 ¼ cup  regular mustard 
 Directions : 
 Garlic mayonnaise : 
 Place all ingredients except oil in blender. 
 Blend on high until all ingredients are well blended. 
 Add the oil in a slow steady stream. 
 If the mayo is too thick add a few drops of lemon juice (the extra mayo can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week. It's great on sandwiches and in chicken salad). 
 Salad : 
 Cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker for 10 – 15 minutes, depending on the size of potatoes. 
 Boil eggs for 10 minutes. 
 After both have cooled, peel, dice and add to bowl. 
 Add the onions and then salt and pepper to taste. 
 Add dill, mustard and mayo to the consistency that you like — some people like their potato salad dry, some like it very moist. 
 Refrigerate overnight for best flavor.
