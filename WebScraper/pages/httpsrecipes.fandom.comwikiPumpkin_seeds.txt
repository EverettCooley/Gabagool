 Pumpkin seeds are occasionally served as a snack during Autumn holidays like Halloween or Thanksgiving. Often they are prepared by separation from orange pumpkin flesh, mixture with a generally salty sauce (Worcestershire sauce, for example), even distribution on a baking sheet, and oven-heating at a relatively low temperature for a long period of time.
