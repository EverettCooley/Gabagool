 Prep Time: 20 minutes 
 Cook time: 1 hour 
 Serves: 3 
 
 Description : 
 These potato skins are deceptively good for you. They're crisp and delicate. They go great with a glass of white wine. I'm not going to say that you'll loose weight eating these 24/7... but they're not nearly as bad for you as traditional "American" potato skins.
 
 Ingredients : 
       A cell phone picture of the skins, pre cooked.     
 3  potatoes  without eyes or bruises 
 4  green onions 
 ¼  red onion 
 ½  tomato 
 8  mushrooms 
 feta  cheese 
 olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 450 °F 
 Clean the potatoes thoroughly. You have to be able to eat the skin. 
 Chop the green and red onions, tomato and mushrooms into ¼ pieces 
 Cut the potatoes in half and scoop out the insides of each half to your desired thickness. 
 Brush a thin coating of olive oil on the insides of the potatoes. 
 Follow the olive oil with a bit of feta spread across the inside of the potato. 
 sprinkle the onions, tomato and mushrooms on the potato skins. 
 bake for 1 hour (or until the skin becomes crispy).
