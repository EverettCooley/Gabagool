 About Blue Castello : 
 Blue Castello is a triple-cream blue cow's milk cheese from Denmark that was developed in the 1960s by the Tholstrup cheese company (established in 1893 by Rasmus Tholstrup). The washed rind hosts various molds that add to the cheese's mildly spicy flavor. It has a smooth, rich texture much like Brie. A very soft, blue-veined Danish cheese with a buttery flavor. This blue cheese has a spreadable quality making it excellent for appetizers or as a snacking cheese it goes well with fruit and nuts.
 Within the Castello range, there is also a white and black variation.
