 Description : 
 You can find fraykee in many Middle Eastern stores or you can do as I have done: Substitute  bulgur  and toast it before using in the recipe. In response to a previous request, I found this recipe in "The Frugal _ful_ are small Egyptian dried beans, according to Smith. I understand that you can use fava beans. Who knows? maybe they are the same thing.
