Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Sandwiches
 It's hard to go wrong when sandwiching your favorite ice cream 
between 2 homemade cookies. Bake the cookies on a cool summer day and 
assemble the frozen creations for the steamy days ahead. If time is 
limited, buy thin chocolate wafers from the supermarket or your 
favorite cookies from the bakery. 
 
Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip-Oatmeal Cookies
 � cup whole-wheat flour 
� cup toasted wheat germ(see Tip) 
� teaspoon baking soda 
� teaspoon ground cinnamon 
� teaspoon salt 
� cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 
� cup granulated sugar 
� cup packed light brown sugar 
1 egg 
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 
1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
 Sandwich filling
 2 pints vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry ice cream, or any other 
flavor of your choice
 Preheat the oven to 375� F. Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick 
cooking spray. Position 2 oven racks in the center and upper third of 
the oven. 
 
To make the cookies: Stir the flour, wheat germ, baking soda, 
cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl. Put the butter and 
sugars into another medium bowl; use an electric mixer on medium 
speed to beat until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the egg and vanilla; 
beat on low speed until well combined, about 15 seconds. Gradually 
add the flour mixture and beat until thoroughly combined. Stir in the 
oats and chocolate chips. 
 
Use a small (2 tablespoon) ice cream scoop to make 1 �-inch balls of 
the dough; place them about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. 
Press down the tops of the balls just slightly. Bake for 12 to 14 
minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through the baking time 
for even browning; the cookies should be lightly browned and still 
slightly soft in the center. Place the baking sheet on a wire rack 
for about 3 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer the cookies to 
racks to cool. 
 
Let the ice cream soften slightly. (You can put it in the 
refrigerator for about 5 minutes.) Spoon the ice cream into a � - cup 
measuring cup. Turn it out onto the flat bottom of a cookie. Top with 
a second cookie, flat side down. Press gently. Wrap in plastic and 
freeze until firm, at least 1 hour. 
 
Advance preparation
Ice cream sandwiches will keep for up to 2 weeks in the freezer; put 
the single-wrapped sandwiches in a freezer bag or freezer container 
or double-wrap them in plastic. The texture of the cookies softens 
after being frozen.
