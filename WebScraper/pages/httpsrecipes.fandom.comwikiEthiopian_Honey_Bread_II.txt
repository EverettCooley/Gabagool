Description : 
 This is an amazingly good bread. The original recipe did not call for  raisins  but I think that it really adds something to it.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  milk 
 2 tsp  coriander 
 3 tsp  water 
 ½ tsp  cloves 
 6 tsp  honey 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon 
 1  egg 
 1 tsp  salt 
 3½ tsp  butter 
 1½ tsp  yeast 
 3¼ cups  flour 
 ⅓ cup  raisins 
 Directions : 
 All ingredients should be room temperature. 
 Add ingredients (except the  raisins ) according to the bread machine directions. 
 Bake on full cycle; add  raisins  after the first 20 minutes.
