 Ingredients : 
 Pastry : 
 2 cups  plain flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ⅔ cup cold  water 
 Leek filling : 
 2 whole  leeks ; (3 cups chopped) 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon hot  chili pepper 
 3 teaspoons  oil 
 To finish : 
 oil ; for deep frying 
 Directions : 
 Sift  flour  and  salt  into a bowl, make a well in the center and add  water . Mix to a firm dough and knead for 5 minutes until elastic, dusting with more  flour  if necessary. Wrap in plastic film and leave to rest for 30 minutes. 
 Cut most of the green tops from  leeks , halve lengthwise and rinse well to remove all traces of soil between leaves. Remove roots and dry  leeks  with paper towels. Place flat on board, cut along length at 5 mm (¼ inch) intervals than across to dice. Measure in cup measure and place in bowl. Add  salt  and  chili pepper  and knead with hand to soften  leeks . Stir in  oil . 
 Roll pieces of dough into balls the size of a large  hazelnut  and roll thinly into a 10 cm (4 inch) circle. Alternatively, roll out dough and cut into 10 cm (4 inch) rounds. Place about 2 teaspoons  leek  filling in center of circle, moisten pastry half way round edge of circle and fold pastry over filling. Press edge to seal well, and using the edge of a thimble, (the traditional method) or a  coffee  spoon make little crescent- shaped marks around the edge, or press with fork. 
 Fry 3 or 4 at a time in hot  oil  until golden brown, turning to brown evenly. Drain on paper towels and serve hot or warm.
