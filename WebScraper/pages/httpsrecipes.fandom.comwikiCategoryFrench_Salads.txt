 A regular French salad usually is based on celery or lettuce as the main ingredient, and a specific dressing made of lemon juice, garlic, mustard, chili sauce, olive oil, paprika, horseradish, salt and pepper. This dressing is used to making a typical French salad in restaurants all over Europe. Zesty blue cheese is also used for the dressing to make it thicker and more consistent. For a French salad, the dressing is really the most important ingredient, and you can choose form garlic oily ones, to creamy hot and spicy dressings. Coleslaw is also available as a salad and as a side dish for main courses. Other ingredients of a salad may be spinach, green beans, carrots, rice, tomatoes and cucumbers, and gold peppers. Chicken and seafood is usually preferred for meat salads, but grilled beef can also be served on a lettuce platter as a salad or appetizer. Fruit salads are usually served as desserts together with some ice cream or liquor and whip cream.
