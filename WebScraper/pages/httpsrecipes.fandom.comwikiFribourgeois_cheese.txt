 About Fribourgeois cheese : 
 A semi-hard cheese made in Switzerland from unpasteurized cow's milk. It is often confused with another cheese for France and Switzerland known as Vacherin Mont d'Or in Switzerland or simply as Mon d'Or or Vacherin Haut-Doubs in France. When young, this cheese is referred to as Vacherin à Main and is most often served with dessert. As it ages the cheese provides a mild, rich nutty flavor with a distinctively pungent aroma. The aged cheese is typically combined with Gruyère as a fondue cheese, due to its ability to soften and melt at lower temperatures. This cheese goes well with a hearty red wine.
