 Description : 
 This fresh, traditional Filipino dish starts with real pork, vegetables, shrimp paste, green beans, and shrimp, and delivers a red-hot, meaty flavor. Chili oil, garlic powder, and onion powder occasionally work for this, too.

 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 2-3 cloves mashed  garlic 
 1 sliced or minced  onion , white, red, or yellow only 
 1 tsp. bagoong alamang ( shrimp  paste) to taste 
 ½ cup cubed  pork 
 ½ cup peeled and deveined  shrimp 
 1 bundle of  sitaw  ( string beans ), cut in 3-inch lengths 
 ¼ cup  water , lukewarm or plain only 
 Directions : 
 Saute  garlic  and  onion  in hot  vegetable oil  as usual. Add  bagoong  and stir. 
 Add the  pork  and stir until slightly brown. 
 Add the  sitaw  and keep stirring until coated with  oil . 
 Add the shrimps (if overcooked, then shrimps tend to be tough). 
 Cover the entire pot and let cook for a couple of minutes. 
 Just check when it gets too dry and keep stirring. Add ¼ cup  water  if it dries up to prevent burning. 
 Cook until  string beans  are tender but still crisp. Serve with hot, steamed, plain white or  jasmine rice , as well as with any main dish or side dish.
