 Description : 
 In Romanian: Prajitura turceasca (Tis-pis-tiri)
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  egg 
 1½ cups  oil 
 1 cup  water 
 1 tablespoon  confectioner's sugar 
 grated peel from 1  lemon 
 salt 
 flour  as needed 
 shortening  and  flour  to grease and dust the pan 
 Syrup : 
 1 lb / 500 g  sugar 
 1¼ cups  water 
 vanilla 
 juice from 1  lemon 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  sugar  with the  egg , mix with  oil ,  salt ,  lemon peel ,  sugar  and  water . 
 Add  flour  and knead a soft dough. Let it rest for 10 minutes and then roll into a finger thick sheet. 
 Cut into squares (not too big) and arrange on the greased and dusted baking sheet, at a distance one from the other. 
 While they bake, prepare the syrup. 
 Set to boil the  sugar  with 1¼ cup  water  and  vanilla ; after a few minutes, add  lemon juice  and remove from heat. 
 When the squares are nicely golden-brown, scald with this syrup and bake a little longer so that the syrup gets well into the dough.
