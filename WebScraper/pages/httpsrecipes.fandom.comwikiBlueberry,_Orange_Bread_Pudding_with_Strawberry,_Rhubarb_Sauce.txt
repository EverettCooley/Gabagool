 3 tablespoons  unsalted butter 
 ⅔ cup  sugar 
 1⅔ cup whole  milk 
 3 extra large  eggs , plus 1  yolk

 2 cups diced  rhubarb 
 6 tablespoons  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Process day-old  bread  slices to make a rough mix.

 Combine the  sugar ,  milk ,  eggs  and  orange  rind, beat well. 
 Mix into the bread mixture. 
 Let rest a few minutes to drink up the liquid. 
 Place into the soufflé bowl. 
 Cover the dish with aluminum foil so it fits tightly around the sides, but is loose on top. 
 Cut a piece of foil 2 feet by 1 foot and double it twice lengthwise to create a strip for moving the dish to and from the pressure cooker. 
 In a 5-7 quart pressure cooker, add the one cup of  water  and insert the trivet. 
 Lower the soufflé dish in place with the foil strip. 
 Fold the ends over the dish. 
 Lock the lid in place and bring to high pressure. 
 Adjust the heat to maintain pressure and cook for 15 minutes. 
 Let the pressure drop naturally.

 Lock the lid in place and bring to pressure. 
 Turn the heat off and let the pressure drop naturally.
