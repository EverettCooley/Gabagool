Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp  butter  or  olive oil 
 1 lb hard  yellow squash  or  pumpkin 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 1/2 tsp  black pepper 
 1 tsp candied or fresh minced  ginger 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Peel  Squash  and cut into 1" to 1-1/2" chunks. 
 Place in a pan, preferably non-stick, with the rest of the ingredients and about 1/3 cup of  water . 
 Bring to a boil. 
 Cover tightly and turn heat as low as possible. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until  Squash  is very tender. Add a little more  water  if mixture starts to become dry. 
 Remove from heat and stir vigorously to break up the chunks, but leave it somewhat chunky. 
 Add a pat of  butter  on top and a sprinkle of  black pepper  to serve. 
 Alternate Method : This can be prepared quickly, and with less danger of scorching, in the microwave. Reduce  water  to less than 1/4 cup, and process two minutes at a time, stirring and checking.
