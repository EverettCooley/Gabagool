 About Soy yogurt : 
 Soy yogurt, (Soya yoghurt in British English) also referred to as Soygurt or Yofu (a portmanteau of yoghurt and tofu), is yogurt prepared using  soy milk , yogurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) and sometimes additional sweeteners, like fructose, glucose, or sugar. It is suitable for vegans, and for people with a milk allergy, as the bacteria for shop-bought soy yogurt are usually not grown on a dairy base.
 Soy yogurt can be prepared at home using the same method as dairy  yogurt . One tablespoon of sugar per 1 liter of unsweetened soy milk may be added to promote bacterial fermentation. Soy milk on its own lacks the lactose (milk sugar) that is the basic food for the yogurt bacteria.
 Soy yogurt may have a slight beany soy taste when made directly from freshly prepared soymilk, but this is less pronounced in shop-bought soy yogurt and in soy yogurt made from commercial soy milk.
 Soy yogurt contains less fat than yogurt made with whole milk. This amounts to about 2.7% (the same percentage as soy milk), versus 3.5% in dairy yogurt. However, dairy yogurt can be made with 2%, 1%, or fat-free milk, and soy yogurt can also be made from reduced-fat soy milk.
