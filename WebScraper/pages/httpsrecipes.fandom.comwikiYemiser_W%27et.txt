 Spicy lentil stew
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup dried  brown lentils 
 1 cup  onions , finely chopped

 Meanwhile, sauté the  onions  and  garlic  in the niter kebbeh, until the  onions  are just translucent. 
 Add the  berbere ,  cumin , and  paprika  and sauté for a few minutes more, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. 
 Mix in the chopped  tomatoes  and  tomato paste  and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Add 1 cup of  vegetable stock  or  water  and continue simmering. 
 When the  Lentils  are cooked, drain them and mix them into the sauté mixture. 
 Add the  green peas  and cook for another 5 minutes. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 To serve Yemiser W'et, spread layers of injera on individual plates. Place some  yogurt  of  cottage cheese  alongside a serving of w'et on the injera and pass more injera at the table. To eat, tear off pieces of injera, fold it around bits of stew, and, yes, eat it with your fingers.
