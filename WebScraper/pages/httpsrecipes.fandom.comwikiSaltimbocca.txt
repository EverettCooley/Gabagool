      Saltimbocca     Literally translated, this Italian term means jump mouth. It refers to a Roman specialty made of finely sliced veal sprinkled with sage and topped with a thin slice of Prosciutto. It's saut√©ed in butter, then braised in white wine. Sometimes the meat layers are rolled and secured with picks before being cooked.
