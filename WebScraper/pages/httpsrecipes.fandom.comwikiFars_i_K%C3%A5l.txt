Description : 
 Most types of leafed  cabbage  is suitable for this traditional but spectacular dish. In Denmark we mostly use the traditional white  cabbage .
 
       Fars i kål     
 Ingredients : 
 400 g  minced pork 
 1 small  onion 
 4 tbsp  breadcrumbs 
 2 small  eggs 
 water  (if required) 
 100 ml fresh  herbs 
 5  gherkins 
 1 medium  cabbage 
 300 - 400 ml  stock 
 corn flour 
 vinegar  from the  gherkin 
 butter 
 sherry  (optional) 
 parsley 
 Directions : 
 Make a light soft minced meat out of the meat,  salt ,  pepper , grated  onion , breadcrumb,  egg  and  water  (if required). 
 Fold in the chopped herbs and chopped  gherkin . 
 Cut the  cabbage  in 4. 
 Remove the stalk and chop the leaves roughly. 
 Boil for 2 minutes in 200 ml  water , a teaspoon  salt , and a little  butter  or  oil . 
 Preserve the  water  when finished. 
 Place meat and  cabbage  in layers in a greased ovenproof dish, finishing with meat on top. 
 Drizzle with a little melted  butter  and bake on lowest rack for 30 minutes in a 200°C (390°F) preheated oven. 
 Sift the gravy from the dish into a pan and add the  water  from the boiling of the  cabbage  and a little stock. 
 Bring to the boil and thicken with  corn flour  mixed with a little  water . 
 Season the sauce with some of the  vinegar  from the  gherkin , and, if desired, a little  sherry . 
 The aim is to get a slightly sweet and sour herbed taste. 
 Serve hot from the oven, with dark bread such as the famous Danish rye bread. 
 Tip : 
 Try this recipe with  minced lamb , season with lots of  garlic  instead of the  gherkin . That gives an entirely different taste over the same theme.
