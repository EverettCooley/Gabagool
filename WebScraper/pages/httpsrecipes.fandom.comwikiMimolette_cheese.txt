 About Mimolette cheese : 
 Mimolette  is a cheese traditionally produced around the city of  Lille ,  France  (where it is also known as  Boule de Lille ), and also in some areas of Belgium and the Netherlands, such as Flanders (where it is also known as  vieux Hollande ).
 A cow's-milk cheese, it normally weighs about 2 kg (approximately 4.5 pounds). Its name comes from "mollet". When young its crust is supple, but with age it becomes harder. It has a grey crust and orangish flesh. The orange color comes from the natural colorant  Achiote . Due to its appearance, this cheese is often mistaken at first glance for a cantaloupe!
 The greyish crust of aged Mimolette is the result of  cheese mites  intentionally introduced to add flavor by their action on the surface of the cheese.
 Mimolette can be consumed at different stages of ageing. Most cheese-lovers appreciate it most when "extra-old" (extra-vieille). At that point, it can become rather hard to chew, and the flesh takes a delicious hazelnut-like flavour.
