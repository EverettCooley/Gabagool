Description : 
 Hot pepper relish is the key ingredient in this zesty salsa. 
 ChupNote: We used harissa instead of hot pepper relish, but you could use ajvar or any other hot sauce. We also doubled the green olives to ½ cup, sliced. You could up the fiber by adding ½ cup minced flat leaf parsley or cilantro or mint.
