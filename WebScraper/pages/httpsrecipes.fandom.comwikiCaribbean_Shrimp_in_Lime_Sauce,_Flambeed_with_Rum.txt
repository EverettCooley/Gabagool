 Description : 
 Recipe from Spring/99 issue of Gusto Magazine, donated by Daniel et Daniel Catering, Toronto. I prepared this dish for a "Caribbean Theme", birthday barbeque for 20 guests, by adjusting the recipe, times 5. It worked very well, and was a popular dish. Because the recipe was increased, times five, it had to be cooked in two batches, using two skillets at a time, on the barbeque. Flambe on a barbeque presents a small challenge but it can be done. There were no leftovers
