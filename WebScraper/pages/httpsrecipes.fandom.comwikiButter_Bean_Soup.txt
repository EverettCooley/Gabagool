Butter Bean Soup
 Lima beans shine in this creamy soup flavored with tomatoes and onion flakes. Onion flakes have an intense flavor which when cooked in the soup impart a deep and sweet onion flavor.
1 pound lima beans 
2 (14.5-ounce) cans chicken broth 
1 (14.5-ounce) can stewed tomatoes 
3 tablespoons butter 
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes 
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1. Soak lima beans in water to cover in a stockpot overnight. 
2. The second day drain beans. Leave beans in stockpot; add broth, tomatoes, butter, onion flakes, sugar, salt and pepper in a saucepan. 
3. Bring heat to a boil; lower heat to a simmer, cover and simmer for about 2 hours or until beans are tender. Serve hot; offer a splash of vinegar or a dollop of sour cream with soup. 
 Makes 6 servings.
