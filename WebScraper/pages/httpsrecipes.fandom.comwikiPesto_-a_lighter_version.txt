Hi All!
I haven't checked in here in awhile - nice to be back!
Since it's basil season, I thought you might like this!
 Pesto - a lighter version
 2 TBS pine nuts (pignoli nuts) 
2 garlic cloves, minced 
3 TBS olive oil 
4 cups fresh basil leaves 
1/2 cup parmesan cheese 
1/4 tsp salt 
Combine nuts and garlic and then process it all in the food processor 
or blender, or mix by hand.
