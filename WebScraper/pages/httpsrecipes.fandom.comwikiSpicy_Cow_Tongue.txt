Ingredients : 
 1  tongue  of cow (2 lbs more or less) 
 water  sufficient to cook the tongue 
 ½ cup  oil 
 2 cups  white onion , cut into thin strips 
 1 cup  tomato , peeled and finely chopped 
 ½ cup ground  spicy red pepper 
 ½ cup  parsley , finely chopped 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1 teaspoon crumbled  oregano 
 ½ teaspoon ground  pepper 
 1 cup green  peas , peeled 
 4 cups  broth  or water 
 1 spoonful  salt 
 To Serve : 
 8 whole cooked  potatoes 
 Chuño Phuti 
 uncooked  salsa 
 2 spoonfuls  parsley , finely chopped 
 Directions : 
 Before cooking the tongue, soften it by beating it with a cooking hammer so that later it is easy to peel. Pour water in a large casserole and set it to boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling add the tongue. Let it cook for two hours until it is soft. 
 Remove the tongue from the pot, let it cool and peel the skin that covers it. Then cut the tongue into thin slices. 
 In a separate casserole add the oil and set to cook over high heat. Once the oil is hot add the onion. Sauté the onion. Then add the tomato, spicy red pepper, parsley, cumin, oregano, ground pepper, peas, broth and finally the salt. Mix well and let it cook for one hour more or less. The mixture must be thick. 
 To the previous preparation add the tongue slices, mix well and let it cook a little until the tongue takes the flavor from the sauce. 
 Serve hot with one potato per person, chuño phuti and steamed rice. Garnish with the uncooked sauce on top.
