 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 x dried black-eyed  Peas 
 1/2  Onion 
 1 x lipton  rice  'n' sauce cajun 
 1 tbsp  pepper 
 1 x stew meat 
 1 tsp creole or cajun seasoning 
 1 x  bell pepper 
 cayenne pepper  or hot sauce 
 Directions : 
 Look thru  Peas  for rocks and wash through 3 waters. Soak  Peas  in  water  overnight in fridge. The next day, throw out  water  they soaked in; some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on this diet a couple weeks and you won"t have a problem anyway. It goes away. Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked  Peas  in big pot on stove and bring to boil, with plenty of  water . Add seasonings to taste. If you use cajun seasoning it contains  salt ; so don"t add extra  salt !!!! otherwise, add  salt  to taste. When stew meat and  Peas  come to a boil, reduce to medium and keep watching to add  water  so they don"t scorch. After about 40 minutes add packet of  rice  and sauce, preferably cajun flavor. Start watching the  water  really carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about 20 minutes of  rice  cooking, add  bell pepper ,  Onion , and more seasonings if you need. (this dish is good hot and peppery) everything should be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat
