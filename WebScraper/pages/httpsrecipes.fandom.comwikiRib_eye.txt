The rib eye or ribeye, also known as the Scotch fillet (in Australia and New Zealand), is a beef steak from the beef rib. When cut into steaks, the ribeye is one of the most popular, juicy, but quite expensive steaks on the market. Meat from the rib section is more tender and fattier (the meat is said to be "marbled") than most other cuts of beef. This extra fat makes ribeye steaks and roasts especially tender and flavorsome, and well suited to dry heat cookery.
 The ribeye can be cut boneless or bone-in; a "bone-in ribeye" (sometimes called a "cowboy ribeye") is synonymous with a rib steak. The cuts are otherwise identical; a justification sometimes used for leaving the bone in is that extra moisture and fat alongside the bone will enhance the flavor, although the inclusion of bone may also be used to inflate the weight of the steak.
