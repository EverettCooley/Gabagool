About French roast : 
 French roast is a method of roasting  coffee  beans, which can then be ground up and used in coffee or espresso drinks. Fresh coffee beans are small and green, and must be roasted for consumption in beverages. To roast beans using the French roast method, the beans are roasted at temperatures between 370째F and 540째F (188째C to 282째C) for 11 to 13 minutes. While the beans are roasting, then you will hear a popping sound, or "crack." After the first crack, the beans would be characterized as Cinnamon or City roast, with a light, mild flavor. If you leave the beans in the roaster until they crack again, then the resulting beans will be French roast beans.
