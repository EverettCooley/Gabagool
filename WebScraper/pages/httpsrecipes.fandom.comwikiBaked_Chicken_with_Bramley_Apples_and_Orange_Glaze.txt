 Description : 
 This is a simple but very tasty way of cooking chicken; it can be made well in advance, and cooked at the last moment. If you can leave the chicken to marinate overnight then all the better.
 This method works very well with monkfish and also salmon, eaten hot straight from the oven or left to cool and eaten as a cold supper or lunch dish.

 Ingredients : 
 4 corn fed, free range  chicken  breasts, medium, skin removed 
 2 tsp black  peppercorns 
 ½ tsp ground  allspice 
 1 tsp dried  oregano 
 ½ tsp ground  cumin 
 1 tsp ground  cinnamon 
 2 cloves of  garlic , peeled and crushed 
 175 ml  orange juice 
 2 small  Bramley apples , peeled, cored and cut into small pieces 
 3 tsp  honey 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Heat the oven to 220 °C, Gas Mark 7. 
 Using a rolling pin crush the black peppercorns, place these along with the spices, oregano and garlic into a bowl large enough to take the chicken breasts and mix well. 
 Add the orange juice, olive oil and honey and mix well. 
 Add the chicken, coat in the marinade and then leave for 10 minutes. 
 Drain and then place the chicken into a baking tray; bake in the pre heated oven for 20 -25 minutes. The chicken must be cooked and juicy, but not overcooked, dry and stringy. 
 Meanwhile pop the marinade into a saucepan and cook over a gentle heat until thick and syrupy. Add the apples just at the end to cook through, but not break up completely 
 Cut each chicken breast into 3 and drizzle over the reduced glaze. 
 Serve with plain boiled rice or mashed potatoes with a few spring onions stirred through at the last moment.
