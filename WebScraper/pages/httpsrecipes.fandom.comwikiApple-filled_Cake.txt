 3 cups of chopped, peeled  Apples 
 2 cups of  Sugar 
 4 Tablespoons of  cornstarch 
 3 cups of white  flour 
 1 Tablespoon of  baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon of  baking soda 
 1/3 cup of  butter  or  margarine , soft but not melted 
 2 beaten  eggs 
 1 cup of  buttermilk 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla 
 1/2 cup of white  flour 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan combine the  Apples  and 1/2 cup of  water . Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer about 10 minutes until the  Apples  are tender. Combine 1/2 cup of  Sugar  and the  cornstarch . Stir into the fruit mixture. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook two more minutes. Set aside. 
 In a mixing bowl stir together 1 cup of the  Sugar , the 3 cups of  flour , the  baking powder , and  baking soda . Reserve 4 Tablespoons of the  butter .

Spread half of the batter into an 9" x 13" cake pan. Spread the fruit mixture over the batter. Drop the remaining batter by rounded Tablespoons over the top of the  Apple  filling. Do not spread it. Leave it in mounds (evenly spaced) on top of the filling. 
 On the side, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of  Sugar  and the 1/2 cup of  flour . Cut in the remaining 4 Tablespoons of  butter  until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Sprinkle over the cake. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 40â€“45 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
