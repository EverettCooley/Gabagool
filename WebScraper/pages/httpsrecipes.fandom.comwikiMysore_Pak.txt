 1 cup  besan 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 2 cups  ghee 
 1¾ cups  water

 Dissolve the  sugar  in the  water  and heat it.

 Remove all the lumps in the besan and add it to the syrup, 1 table spoon at a time. 
 Reduce the heat and add 2 teaspoons of  ghee . 
 Stir, till the  flour  and  ghee  has completely blended with the syrup. 
 Continue to stir and keep adding  ghee  1tsp at a time till the mixture changes color and texture. At one point, you will observe that the mixture is not able to absorb any more  ghee . Also, the whole mixture becomes porous and starts leaving the edges of the vessel. 
 At this point, transfer the mixture into a greased plate and with a spatula press the mixture down till the excess  ghee  surfaces. Do not remove the excess  ghee . 
 Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. 
 Cut it into desired shape and wait for another 10 minutes.
