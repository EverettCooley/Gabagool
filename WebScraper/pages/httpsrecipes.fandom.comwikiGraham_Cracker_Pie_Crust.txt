Description : 
 I once worked with a young woman who didn't know it was possible to make your own graham cracker pie crusts. All she or her mother had ever used were store-bought. Like many young homemakers, she didn't remember the days when pies were made from scratch and running to the store every day wasn't an option. 
 Making your own graham cracker pie crust is so quick and easy! And most of us always have the 3 ingredients on hand, so there's really no good reason not to make your own! 
 So here's the recipe—an added bonus to the obvious money-saving is—homemade tastes lots better!
