Finding the ingredients for an Indian Recipe is not so easy when you do not know the names of the ingredients. Take time to make a list of ingredients and the name they may be found under at the local markets. You may have to look and ask questions the first few times if you are unfamiliar with ingredient names. Most packaging will not be in English (although you might be surprised to see what does have it)!
