Makes enough for 6 as a side dish; or 4 as a main course.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 1/2 cups  vegetable stock , blended with a 1/2 cup of  lemon juice , kept at a low simmer on the stove top 
 1/2 cup fresh  lemon juice 
 4 cups sliced  Mushrooms 
 1 large  red onion , minced 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 4  shallots , minced 
 1/3 cup chopped fresh  basil 
 2 cups arborio  rice 
 4 tbsp  margarine 
 1/4 cup  nutritional yeast 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Melt 2 tbsp of the margarine in a large sauce pan. 
 Add the mushrooms, onions, garlic and shallots and saute for a few minutes. 
 Add the rice and stir for two minutes. 
 Add 1/2 cup of the simmering stock to the pot and stir until it is absorbed. 
 Continue adding 1/2 cup of stock at a time, and letting it absorb into the rice before adding the next ladelful. Fear not! 2 cups of rice will indeed absorb 7 cups of liquid. The rice will begin to release starch and the whole mixture will take on a creamy consistency. 
 Once all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped basil, the nutritional yeast, the last 2 tbsp margarine, and salt and pepper to taste. 
 Serve immediately.
