 2.1   Piripiri sauce variation for chicken 
 
 
 3   Directions 
 
 
 Description : 
 From Mozambique’s Zambezia province comes this spicy-hot  chicken  with  coconut milk .
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 – 4 lbs  chicken  pieces 
 1 cup  butter 
 Piripiri  sauce variation for chicken : 
 4  red peppers , crushed or 2 heaping tsp  cayenne pepper 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1 cup of  coconut milk 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 6 sprigs  parsley , chopped 
 1 cup  butter  or  oil 
 Directions : 
 Marinate (soak) the  chicken  pieces in piripiri sauce for at least two hours (if you have time for them to marinate longer, cover and refrigerate). 
 When you’re ready to cook, melt a cup of  butter  and add it to the marinade. 
 Use this mixture to coat  chicken  while it cooks. 
 Either broil the  chicken  or grill it over a charcoal fire. 
 To broil, lay pieces on a rack over a pan deep enough to catch the grease that will drip down. 
 Cook 10 – 15 minutes on each side, basting several times with the sauce. 
 When  chicken  is tender, serve with a fresh batch of piripiri sauce - made as before, but heated for five minutes before being passed around.
