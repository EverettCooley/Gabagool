Arbequina olives are small, brown olives mostly grown in Catalonia, but also in Aragon, Andalusia, Argentina, and Chile.
 The name comes from the town of Arbeca; however, this variety is said to be actually originally from Palestine.
 As well as being a table olive, it is used to produce a highly valued olive oil. Generally, arbequina-based olive oils are more buttery, with a slightly peppery finish.
 Arbequina olives have one of the highest concentration of oil and are therefore mostly used for olive oil production. Harvesting is easy since the trees are typically low to the ground and allow for easy hand picking.
