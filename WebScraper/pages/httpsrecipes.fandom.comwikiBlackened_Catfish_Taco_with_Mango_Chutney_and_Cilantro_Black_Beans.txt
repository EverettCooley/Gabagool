 Directions : 
 To Make The Chutney : 
 In a pot over medium heat, combine the mango, bell pepper, onion, jalape単o, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, lime juice, and vinegars. 
 Season with salt and pepper. 
 Cook for 20 minutes, or until the chutney thickens, stirring occasionally. 
 Remove from heat, cover to keep warm. 
 To Make The Black Beans : 
 Coat a pot with the oil and place over medium-low heat. 
 When the oil is hot, add the onion, jalape単o, and garlic. Season with cumin, salt, and pepper. 
 Cook and stir for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and fragrant. 
 Mix in the beans and cook for 5 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. 
 Remove from the heat. Squeeze in the lime juice and stir in the cilantro. Cover to keep warm 
 To Make The Tacos : 
 In a pie plate, combine the granulated garlic, chili powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, and cayenne. Mix with a fork to evenly distribute the spices. 
 Dredge both sides of the catfish pieces in the spice mixture to evenly coat, tapping off the excess. 
 Brush a large grill pan with the oil and place over medium-high heat. 
 When the oil begins to smoke, lay the catfish in the pan and grill for 3 to 5 minutes. 
 Turn the fish over and grill for 3 minutes longer, or until the fish is completely cooked through. 
 Remove the fish to a cutting board and shred into pieces using two forks. 
 Put the tortillas on the grill for 30 seconds on each side to warm them up. 
 To serve, put 2 tortillas on each plate and top with a heaping spoonful of the black beans. Divide the catfish among the tortillas. Put a spoonful of the chutney on top, and garnish with shredded lettuce, avocado, sour cream, and cilantro.
