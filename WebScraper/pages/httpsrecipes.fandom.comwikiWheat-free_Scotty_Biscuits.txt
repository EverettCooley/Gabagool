 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  oatmeal 
 1 cup  rye flour 
 2 tablespoons  sugar 
 1 tablespoon melted  butter  or  margarine 
 ½ cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Combine  oatmeal , ¾ cup of the  rye flour ,  sugar  and  butter  together. 
 Slowly add the  milk  till a firm but slightly sticky dough forms. 
 Scrape out dough onto a wooden board or counter. 
 Knead in the rest of the  rye flour  till the dough stiffens a little. 
 Wrap in saran wrap and chill for one hour. 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
 Roll out dough till ¼ inch thickness. 
 Cut into shapes (I like to use scotty dog cutters).
