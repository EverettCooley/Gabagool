 Ingredients : 
 3/4 cup boiling  water 
 1/3 cup  vegetable shortening 
 1 large  egg , beaten 
 1/4 cup  granulated sugar 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 1 1/2 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour , or more as needed 
 1 1/4 tsp. rapid-rise  yeast 
 1 cup  whole wheat flour 
 2 Tbs.  unsalted butter , melted 
 Directions : 
 1. Pour boiling  water  over  shortening  in large bowl; let stand until lukewarm. 
 
 2. Using wooden spoon, beat  egg ,  Sugar ,  salt  and 1/2 cup  all-purpose flour  into  shortening . Beat in  yeast  until blended.
 
 3. Beat in both flours, 1/2 cup at a time, alternating between all-purpose and  whole wheat flour , until dough is stiff and does not cling to sides of bowl. Turn dough onto floured surface, and knead in any remaining  flour . Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
 
 4. Place dough in large oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with oiled plastic wrap, and let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/4 hours. Or refrigerate dough to rise more slowly, at least 4 hours or overnight.
 
 5. Preheat oven to 350F.
 
 6. Punch dough down, and turn onto lightly floured surface. Using floured rolling pin, roll dough out to about 1/2-inch thick. Use 3-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter to cut circles. Repeat until dough is used up. Brush each circle with  butter ; fold in half, gently pressing edges together to close. Do not pinch edges to seal. Place rolls on large ungreased baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Rolls can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours to rise before baking.
 
 7. Bake 17 to 20 minutes, until slightly browned. Cool slightly on baking sheet.
