 1 cup diced  mushrooms 
 ¾ cup  butter 
 ½ cup  flour 
 1 tbsp  dry mustard 
 5 cup  chicken  or  vegetable stock 
 1 bunch  broccoli 
 11 fl oz  beer  (use a can or bottle and save a swallow for the cook!) 
 6 oz  cheddar  cheese, grated 
 2 tbsp grated  Parmesan cheese 
 salt 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the diced vegetables in  butter . 
 Mix  flour  and  mustard  into sautéed vegetables. 
 Add the  chicken  or  vegetable stock  to mixture and cook for five minutes. 
 Break  broccoli  into small flowerets; cut stems into bite-sizes pieces. 
 Steam until tender-crisp. 
 Add  beer  and cheeses to the soup. 
 Simmer 10 – 15 minutes.

 Notes: because of the  cheese , this soup doesn't survive a night in the refrigerator very well.
