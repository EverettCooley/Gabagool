1-cup granulated sugar
1 1/2-tsp grated lemon peel
1-egg
2-cups all purpose flour
2-tsp baking powder
1/2-tsp salt
1/4-cup milk
1-cup fresh blueberries

 In large bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter until creamy; 
gradually add granulated sugar, beating until smoothly blended. Beat 
in lemon peel and egg. In another bowl, stir together flour, baking 
powder, and salt; add to butter mixture alternately with milk, 
blending thoroughly. Gently stir in blueberries.
 Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto greased baking sheets, 
spacing cookies about 2-inches apart. Bake in a 375 ï¿½F oven for about 
15 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to racks and let cool for 
5 minutes; then sift powdered sugar lightly over tops. Serve warm, or 
let cool completely and store airtight for up to 3 days. Makes about 
 3 dozen.
