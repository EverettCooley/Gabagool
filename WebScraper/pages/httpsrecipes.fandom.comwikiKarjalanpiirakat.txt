 Ingredients : 
 1 decilitre  water 
 ½ - 1 tsp  salt 
 2½ decilitre  rye flour

 2,5 decilitre  water 
 1 litre  milk 
 2,5 decilitre  rice 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Rinse the  rice  and place it in boiling  water . 
 Simmer until most of the  water  is absorbed. 
 Add the  milk , lower the heat to a minimum, and partially cover the pot. 
 Simmer until the  milk  has been absorbed and the  rice  has turned into a thick porridge. 
 Season with  salt  and leave to cool. 
 Add the  flour  and  salt  to the  water  and mix into a solid, compact dough. 
 Form the dough into a strip and divide into 12 pieces. 
 Roll the pieces into flat thin ovals. 
 Spread some filling on each oval. 
 Then fold the sides towards the center, pinching and making neat pleats along the edge. 
 Bake at 300°C for about 10 minutes. 
 Brush them well with melted  butter  or a  butter  and  milk  mixture. 
 Place the pasties, separated with baking paper, in a bowl and cover with a towel to soften the crusts. 
 Serve warm with  butter  or egg butter which is made by mixing equal parts of  butter , ( cottage cheese ) and chopped hard-boiled  egg .
