      Not actual product, just a photo of a glass of lemonade.     
 Description : 
 A lemonade beverage concentrate designed to be served by the glass, mixed with several parts water.  The  tamarind  isn't really necessary and can be left out without changing the other ingredients.  This is designed to be on the sour side and only mildly sweet.
 
 Ingredients : 
 two (2) cups lemon juice 
 one (1) cup tamarind concentrate 
 20 teaspoons sugar (or, if for example using a  stevia  or other  sweetener mixture  that is four times as sweet as sugar, five (5) teaspoons of sweetener) 
 slightly less than one (1) gallon of water 
 Directions : 
 In a one gallon / four liter jug combine all of the ingredients.  It may be efficacious to dissolve the sugar or sweetener in a small amount of water before adding, possibly heating the water to aid dissolution. 
 The contents of the jug is lemonade  concentrate .  Serve by pouring a few finger's worth into the bottom of a glass and then fill the rest of the glass with tap water or bottled water as desired.  The author's preferred mixture is approximately one part concentrate to three parts water, producing a sour beverage that is only mildly sweet. 
 Notes : 
 The tamarind concentrate, although it adds an interesting note to the flavor of the lemonade, isn't really necessary and can be completely left out of the recipe.
 If desired, in the United States the tamarind concentrate may be found in some Asian markets, often amongst Thai or other  SEA  products and ingredients.  Potency may vary between different tamarind extract products.
