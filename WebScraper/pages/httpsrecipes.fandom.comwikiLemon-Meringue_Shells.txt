 Ingredients : 
 2 	 	  egg  whites 
 1 	teaspoon 	 lemon juice 
 1/4 	teaspoon 	 cream of tartar 
 2/3 	cup 	 Sugar 
 1/2 	cup 	 lemon  curd 
 1 	cup 	 blackberries ,  raspberries , or other  Berries 
 Directions : 
 1 	In a large mixing bowl let  egg  whites stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Using a pencil, draw eight 3-inch circles on parchment paper or foil. Turn paper upside down on baking sheet; set aside.
 2 	For meringue, add  lemon juice  and  cream of tartar  to  egg  whites. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Add  Sugar , 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed about 7 minutes or until very stiff peaks form (tips stand straight) and  Sugar  is nearly dissolved.
 3 	For shells, use the back of a large spoon to spread the meringue over circles on parchment paper, building up sides to form shells.
 4 	Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Turn off oven. Let meringues dry in oven, with door closed, for at least 1 hour. Remove from paper. If desired, store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 1 week.
 5 	Just before serving, spoon 1 tablespoon of the  lemon  curd into each meringue shell. Place a few  Berries  on  lemon  curd. Makes 8 servings.
