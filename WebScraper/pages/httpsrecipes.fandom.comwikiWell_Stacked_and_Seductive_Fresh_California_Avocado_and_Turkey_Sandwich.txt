 Stacked right, the rich nutty flavor, silky smooth texture, and lush color of fresh  California avocado  turns an ordinary  Turkey  sandwich into a sensual experience.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 slices of your favorite bread 
 Â½ Ripe Genuine  California avocado 
 4 oz sliced  Turkey 
 Leafed  lettuce 
 Sliced  tomato 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Start with two slices of your favorite bread, toasting is optional, but adds complexity.
 On one slice, layer a leaf or two of  lettuce , about 4 ounces of sliced  Turkey , and juicy  tomato  slices.
 On the other slice - the alpha slice - line up the slices from one-half of a ripe  California avocado . (alternatively smear the  avocado ) 
 salt  and  pepper  to your liking.
 Unite the two sides and dig in.
 For a delectable variation on your  Turkey  sandwich theme: 1) add a couple of strips of cooked  Bacon ; 2) slather the alpha slice with Dijon  mustard , then smear the  avocado  half and press dried  cranberries  into the  avocado ; 3) roughly mash the  avocado  with  lime  and diced chipotle  chili pepper  before smearing; 4) substitute grilled  Chicken  - boneless breast or thigh; 5) substitute smoked  Turkey  for the natural. And remember that a fresh  California avocado  and  Turkey  Sandwich is one of life's basic pleasures that should be enjoyed often!
