      Casserole      The term for a type of ovenproof baking dish or the recipe cooked (generally in the oven) in it. Casserole dishes can be ceramic, glass or metal; traditionally casserole dishes were always covered but the term now applies more broadly to dishes cooked uncovered, as well. Casserole recipes combine a mix of savory ingredients, sometimes including precooked items, but are not as liquid as stews. Tuna casserole, a mix of canned tuna, condensed soup and cooked macaroni, is a classic American casserole dish.
