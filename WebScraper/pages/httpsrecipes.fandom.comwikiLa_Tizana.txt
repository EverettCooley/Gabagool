Ingredients : 
 1 medium pineapple 
 1 mango (or papaya) 
 15 strawberries 
 1 1/2 cups green or red grapes 
 2 ripe bananas 
 3 oranges 
 2 to 3 cups orange juice 
 1 can frozen limeade mix 
 1/4 grenadine 
 Instructions : 
 Gather the ingredients. 
 Peel and chop the pineapple, mango and/or papaya, and strawberries into 1/2 inch dice and add to a large pitcher, including any juice. 
 Slice the grapes in half and add to the other fruit. 
 Peel, seed, and chop 2 of the oranges and add. 
 Cut remaining orange into thin slices and set aside for serving on the rim of each glass. 
 Peel and slice the banana into rounds, then slice each round in half. Add bananas to the rest of the fruit. You should have about 6 cups of chopped fruit. (Use any kind of fruit that you have on hand - other good choices include peaches, kiwis, apples, etc). 
 Cover the fruit with about 2 to 3 cups of orange juice and then add theÂ can of frozen limeade mix. 
 Fill the empty can with water twice and add to the fruit mixture. 
 Stir in the grenadine syrup, adding more than 1/4 cup if desired to obtain the desired color. 
 Chill mixture for several hours before serving, allowing the flavors to blend. 
 To serve, fill each glass 2/3 full, including plenty of chopped fruit, then fill to top with club soda, water, more juice (passion fruit juice would be tasty), or alcohol. Serve glass with a slice of orange on the rim and spoon on the side for the fruit.
