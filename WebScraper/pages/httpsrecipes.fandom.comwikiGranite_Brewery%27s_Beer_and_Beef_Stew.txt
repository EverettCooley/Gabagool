Ingredients : 
 Cubed Veggies : 
 3  carrots 
 3  Spanish onions 
 2  turnips 
 1 can  mushrooms 
 6  potatoes 
 garlic  as desired 
 Miscellaneous : 
 10 liter  water  (half of large pot) 
 1 tbsp  Dijon mustard 
 2  beef oxo cubes 
 ¼ cup  red wine vinegar 
 5 tbsp  tomato paste  (small can) 
 3 tbsp  brown sugar 
 1 bottle  beer  (heck! use 2) 
 1 tsp  pepper 
 1 tsp  thyme 
 Meat : 
 4 kg browned, cubed  beef 
 Roux : 
 1 cup  flour 
 1 cup  oil 
 1 cup  water 
 Directions : 
 The above combination may be varied at will; just remember to use  beer  instead of  water  to improve the flavours. 
 Combine the cubed veggies with the miscellaneous stuff and cook until the veggies are done. 
 Add the  beef  and cook another 5 minutes at low simmer. 
 Finally, add the roux, stir well and cook over medium heat about 15 minutes. 
 To make the roux, which is a thickening agent used around the world and named by the French, you heat the  oil  on medium heat and add the  flour . 
 Stirring constantly, slowly brown the mixture without burning until it turns a nice chocolatey brown. 
 Slowly add in the cold  water , stirring constantly until the consistency is smooth. 
 When required, add to the stew and blend in well with the thinner liquid. 
 The 15 minutes at medium heat causes the  flour  to absorb a lot of the liquid and thicken the stew.
