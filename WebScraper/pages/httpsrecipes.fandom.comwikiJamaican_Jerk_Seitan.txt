 Description : 
 Serve over lots of  rice 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds  seitan  or prepared chicken-style  seitan  ( Wheat  gluten) 
 1 Tbsp.  allspice 
 1 Tbsp.  thyme 
 1 1/2 tsp  Cayenne 
 1 1/2 tsp  black pepper 
 1 1/2 tsp  sage 
 3/4 tsp  cinnamon 
 2 Tbsp.  garlic 
 1 Tbsp.  Sugar 
 1/4 cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari 
 3/4 cup  white vinegar 
 1/2 cup  orange juice 
 juice of one small  lime 
 1/2  Scotch  bonnet (habanero)  pepper , or 1/2 green  chili pepper 
 2  green onions , finely chopped 
 1 cup  Onion  (1/2 a medium-sized  Onion ), finely chopped 
 1 tsp  arrowroot  (or another thickener, like  corn starch ) 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 1. Take the  seitan  and shred it or cut it into chunks, depending on your personal taste. You can use " Chicken  style" pre-packaged  seitan  with *excellent* results. (I tried three different kinds and liked the canned kind from the Asian market the best, while Huyen liked the packaged kind from the health food store).
 2. Combine remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until you have a pretty consistent textured blend. You can play with the ingredients to make it thicker or thinner according to your taste. Marinate  seitan  in the mixture for at least 30 minutes. It absorbs the marinade very fast.
 3. In a large saucepan, simmer over a low flame for about 20 to 30 minutes to heat through and allow the flavors to blend. If you would like the sauce a little thicker add more  arrowroot . Stir occasionally.
