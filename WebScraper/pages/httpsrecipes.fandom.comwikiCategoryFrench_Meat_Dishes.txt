 The French cuisine uses large variety of meats for all kind of recipes, many of them even if sophisticated, being done perfectly. The main meats used are chicken, beef, veal, pork, turkey, mutton and lamb, and even rabbit. Goose meat is also used for the famous foie gras (the liver of a force-fed duck or goose) and for the Cassoulet (a dish made with beans, sausages and preserved duck or goose). Seafood, like cod, sardine, tuna, trout, shrimp, calamari and oysters are used for salads, grills and special sophisticated recipes. Some of the main meat-based dishes include Blanquette de veau (veal with mushrooms and onions), civet de lièvre, coquilles St. Jacques à la Provence (sautéed scallops with wine, shallot, herbs, and garlic) and axoa, a specialty of Gascony made with seasoned ground veal, onions, and red peppers. Either way, cooking manners of a dish is important, or the presentation is crucial, especially in restaurants.
