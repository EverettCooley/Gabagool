      Dahibada     
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups  yogurt  (curd) 
 1 cup Urad  daal 
 1 tsp. Ginger- garlic  paste 
 1 Chopped green  chilli 
 1 tsp. Red  chilli powder 
 1 tsp. Roasted  cumin  powder 
 salt  to taste 
 vegetable oil  as required 
 Chopped  green coriander  leaves for garnishing 
 Green chutney 
 tamarind  chutney 
 Directions : 
 Wash  dal  thoroughly and then soak it in  water  for about 5-6 hours. 
 Grind it in mixer to make smooth paste. 
 Add chopped green  chilli , ginger- garlic  paste and  salt  to taste. Mix well. 
 Take a katori and cover its mouth with a wet cloth. Hold the cloth tight from below so as to get flat surface on top. Put 1 tbsp. of  urad dal  paste on the top of the wet cloth and slightly flatten it with wet hands. Make a small hole in the centre. 
 Slide this bada into the heated  oil  and deep fry until golden brown on medium heat. Similarly make all the badas. You can fry 5-6 badas at a time depending on how big is your kadhai. 
 Once you are done with all the badas, put them in hot  water  for about 3-4 minutes so that they become soft. 
 Squeeze out the  water  by pressing bada between the palms of your hands. 
 Churn  yogurt  and  salt  together until it becomes smooth. 
 Keep one cup of  yogurt  aside and add all the badas to the rest of the  yogurt . Dahi badas are ready to serve. 
 For serving, place dahi bada in a serving dish. Pour the  yogurt  (that was kept aside) on it. #Sprinkle red  chilli powder  and roasted  cumin  powder. 
 Garnish with chopped  coriander leaves  and  tamarind  chutney. 
 Keep rest of the  tamarind  chutney and also green chutney in separate bowls at the side.
