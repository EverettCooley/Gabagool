 About Fenugreek : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Fenugreek on Wikipedia 
 The cuboid yellow to amber coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently used in the preparation of pickles, curry powders, and pastes, and the spice is often encountered in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. The seeds are used as seasoning for many dishes or in powdered form to mix with rice, since the health benefits of added seeds (or leaves) to the diet, in moderate quantities, is considerable[citation needed]. The young leaves and sprouts of fenugreek are eaten as greens, and the fresh or dried leaves are used to flavour other dishes. The dried leaves - also called kasuri methi, after the region of the Punjab where it grows abundantly - have a bitter taste and a characteristically strong smell.
 Fenugreek green is a very popular curry cooked in the major sub-continental region of India and Pakistan, usually together with potatoes and/or spinach, and eaten with Roti or Naan (flatbread) and/or rice. It is usually eaten boiled in China, and central and Western Asia.
 When preparing Fenugreek it is best to soak it a bit to remove the bitterness
