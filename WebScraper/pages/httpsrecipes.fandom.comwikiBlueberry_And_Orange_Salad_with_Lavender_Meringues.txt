 Cook's Tip 
 Directions : 
 lavender  is used in both sweet and  savory  dishes. 
 Always use fresh or recently dried flowers, and avoid artificially scented bunches that are sold for domestic purposes. Of course, if you can’t find fresh  lavender , then you could just make plain meringues. 
 Preheat the oven to 140 °C/275 °F/Gas 1. Line a baking tray with six layers of newspaper and cover with non-stick baking paper. Whisk the  egg  whites in a large mixing bowl until they hold soft peaks. Add the  Sugar  a little at a time, whisking thoroughly after each addition until the meringue is thick and, glossy, then fold in the  lavender  flowers. 
 Spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 5mm/1/4 in plain nozzle. Pipe as many small buttons of meringue on to the prepared baking sheet as you can. Bake the meringues near the bottom of the oven for 1/2–2 hours.
