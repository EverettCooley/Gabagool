 About Seasoned rice vinegar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Seasoned rice vinegar on Wikipedia 
 The Japanese prefer a more delicate rice vinegar and use it for much the same purposes as Europeans, as well as for sushi rice, in which it is an essential ingredient. Rice vinegar is available in white, red and black variants, the last of which is most popular in China. Black rice vinegar may be used as a substitute for balsamic vinegar, though its dark color and the fact that it is aged may be the only similarity between the two products. Some types of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned.
