Ingredients : 
 50 cloves of  garlic , peeled 
 1 cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 ½ cup fresh  lemon juice  (or  balsamic vinegar ) 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tsp freshly ground or cracked  black pepper 
 1 tbsp  herbs 
 Directions : 
 Start by peeling all that  garlic . 
 Now bring a saucepan of  water  to boil. 
 Once the  water  is boiling, turn off heat and drop  garlic  cloves into hot  water . 
 Let sit in  water  for 3 to 5 minutes (use the shorter time if you like a sharper raw  garlic  flavor; the longer time results in a much milder  garlic  flavor). 
 Remove  garlic  and plunge into (or rinse thoroughly with) cold  water  to stop the cloves from "cooking" any further. 
 Dissolve the  salt  into the  lemon juice . 
 Now make a "vinaigrette" with the  olive oil ,  lemon juice / salt ,  pepper  and herbs. 
 Place  garlic  into jars and pour  oil  mixture to top the cloves. 
 Refrigerate.
