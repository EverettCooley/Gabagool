Description : 
 The original version of this chili recipe is baked, but I find it easier to do on the stovetop. To bake, simply brown the meat and onions, and then combine everything in an oven-safe casserole and bake in a moderate oven for about an hour.
 For many years I was unable to get green chilis, and I grew accustomed to the flavor of this chili without them. Thus I list them as optional.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  chicken breast  or tenders, cut into ½-inch pieces 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 medium  onion 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced, or ½ tsp.  garlic powder 
 1 tsp powdered  cumin 
 1 x 15 oz can  garbanzo beans  (chick peas) 
 1 x 15 oz can  cannellini beans  ( white kidney beans  and  navy beans  also work) 
 1 cup frozen  corn 
 1 x 4 oz can of diced  green chilis  (optional) 
 1 box  chicken broth  (4 cups) 
 shredded  cheese 
 Preparation : 
 In a large saucepan, heat oil. Sauté onion, garlic and cumin until onion is soft. 
 Add chicken and cook until white or golden. 
 Add beans, corn, chilis and broth. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for at least an hour.
