Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp  corn starch 
 ½ cup skim  milk 
 1 to 2 eggs' worth of  egg substitute  or 2 – 4  egg whites 
 ½ cup fat-free or low-fat  cottage cheese  (I use 1%) 
 ½ cup fat-free plain  yogurt 
 1 cup reduced fat  tofu  (Mori Nu Lite), cubed 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 1 dash or 2 of  Tabasco sauce 
 one or more of the following:
 ½ cup chopped  onion , sauteed in liquid of choice 
 ½ – 1 cup chopped fresh  mushrooms 
 1 cup chopped cooked  broccoli 
 spinach  or  leeks 
 ½ cup fat-free  mozzarella  cheese 
 herbs to taste ( parsley ,  basil ,  marjoram  are all good) 
 Directions : 
 Purée cornstarch, skim milk, egg substitute, cottage cheese, yogurt, salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce in blender. 
 Stir in the filling of choice pour into quiche dish or pie pan sprayed briefly with PAM and bake at 350°F for 30 – 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted slightly off center comes out clean. 
 Let stand about 5 minutes before serving. 
 Sometimes this comes out watery (like custard sometimes does), but it still tastes good.
