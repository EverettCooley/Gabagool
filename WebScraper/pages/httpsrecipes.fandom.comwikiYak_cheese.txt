 About Yak cheese : 
 Though Tibetans and the Nepalese were historically amongst the few Asians to make use of dairy products at all, they didn't make cheese as we know it and they still don't have much taste for Western-style cheeses. The cheeses now being made from Yak's milk are just for export to Western markets, where they sell as novelty cheeses and command high prices.
 Yak Cheese is also being made now in Bhutan, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and Tibet for export to the West.
