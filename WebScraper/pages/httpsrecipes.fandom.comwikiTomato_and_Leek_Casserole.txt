 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 5 or 6 large  leeks 
 2 lbs firm  tomatoes 
 x ff grated  Cheese  (amount 
 optional according to 
 taste) 
 x bread crumbs 
 x  red wine vinegar 
 x  marjoram ,  thyme ,  sage 
 pepper ,  rosemary 
 Directions : 
 Slice  leeks  and  tomatoes . Layer in casserole dish ( leeks  on the bottom so the juice from the  tomatoes  helps cook them :). Sprinkle with  red wine vinegar . Add  Cheese . Add layer of bread crumbs. Spice according to taste. (repeat layer if desired). Cook at 375 until bread crumbs are golden. The amounts of ingredients in this one can be varied. Some ppl prefer more  tomatoes , while i am allergic to them so tend to skimp there :) the lack of cooking time is due to the origination of the recipe. I learned it in holland and the oven temps there are far different from here. We usually made it in some old nearly broken down toaster oven so the time varied with each attempt :) i have found many non vegan friends love this recipe
