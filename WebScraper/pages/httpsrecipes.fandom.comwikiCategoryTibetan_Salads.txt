 The “Tibetan Rice” is an easy salad to prepare. It contains rice, salad oil, turmeric, curry powder, salt, seedless raisins, water and one can of condense chicken broth. The rice is heated in oil until is well coated with oil. Next step is to blend in turmeric, to add some curry powder and salt and to stir in raisins. All these ingredients need to be cooked in hot water for about one hour, until the rice becomes tender and the liquid is absorbed. The Tibetan “Bean Salad” is made of beans, onion, garlic, tomatoes, lemon juice, green coriander, cumin seed and salt. 
 Everything is mixed together, except the olive oil which is added last. During the cooking it’s recommended to stir gently. Like most of the salads this salad tastes better after a few hours, kept in the refrigerator. The Tibetan “Tse Tofu” is made of greens with tofu, onions, paprika, garlic, fresh ginger, soy sauce, firm tofu, green peas, oil, and garlic and ground black pepper. The Swiss chard is washed and cut into small pieces. The paprika, the garlic, the green onions, the ginger and the yellow onions are fried in oil. The oil is heated into a separate frying pan in which the black pepper is also added. In the end, the tofu mixture is being poured and all the ingredients mixed together.
