 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 Block Extra  firm tofu 
 1 Pkg Original Shake and Bake 
 vegetable oil 
 Marinade : 
 1/3 Cup Light Tamari  soy sauce 
 1/3 Cup  Teriyaki sauce 
 1/4 Cup  maple syrup 
 Directions : 
 Cut tofu into 1/2" slices (one block makes about 8-9 slices), and then cut the slices in half to make fingers. 
 Mix all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and pour over the tofu. 
 Cover the tofu and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours (the longer you leave it in the marinade, the better it tastes. I usually let my tofu marinate all day). 
 When you are ready to use the tofu, remove it from the marinade and coat all the fingers with Shake and Bake. 
 Cover the bottom of a non stick frying pan with vegetable oil. 
 Place all the fingers in the pan, and cook over medium heat until both sides are golden brown. 
 When the tofu fingers are ready, pat them down with paper towel to get rid of some of the excess oil. 
 Serve immediately with  plum sauce  or other desired condiment.
