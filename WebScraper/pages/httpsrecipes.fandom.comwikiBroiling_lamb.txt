Broiling and grilling are essentially the same technique: the application of intense, direct heat to the meat, one side at a time. In grilling, the heat is below the meat; in broiling the heat comes from above. Meat for broiling must be tender, fairly lean, and not too thick, since it cooks quickly. Lamb cuts that are good choices for broiling include chops, tenderloin slices, kebabs, and patties of  ground lamb . In order to properly broil cuts of lamb, it is important to use the correct temperature. The distance the lamb is placed from the heat source is an important factor for determining this, just as it is when lamb is grilled. The temperature is adjusted by changing the distance between the meat and the heat source. Thinner cuts of lamb can be placed closer to the heat source than thicker cuts, since the thicker cut will require more time to cook. If the thicker cut is too close to the heat source, the surface will char before the interior is cooked to the proper degree of doneness. Placing thicker cuts farther from the heat source allows the meat to cook thoroughly without burning the surface. The goal is to produce lamb with a brown, crusty surface and an interior that is juicy and tender.
