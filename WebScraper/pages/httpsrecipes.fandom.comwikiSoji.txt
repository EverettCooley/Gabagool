Ingredients : 
 100 grams  Semolina 
 60grams  Ghee  (clarified  Butter ) 
 200 milliliter  Milk 
 30 grams  Sugar 
 4 drops  Vanilla  Essence 
 Ingredients : 
 Take out your non stick frying pan and heat it on low fire up. Add the Semolina into the pan and stir fry till you see a light color change towards golden brown. Don’t burn it! 
 Now mix in the ghee and continuously stir fry till it gets all together thicker. Continue by adding in the milk (first half the amount), the sugar and the vanilla essence. Don’t forget to keep on stirring while it is all cooking and add in the rest of the milk once it is all getting thicker. The Semolina dish should be sticky and a bit dry. 
 Serve it warm, that’s when it tastes the best. The semolina hardens fast, if kept standing for longer, and the experience might be not the same.
