Ingredients : 
 2 lbs. of  veal cutlets  trimmed of any sinew 
 1 to 2 whole beaten  eggs 
 ½ to 1 cup of  flour 
 2 cups of fine white  bread crumbs 
 salt 
 pepper 
 3 or 4 tbsp  butter  or  lard 
 2 fresh  lemons  quartered 
 Directions : 
 Beat or pound the  veal  cutlets until very thin. 
 Lightly  salt  and  pepper  the  veal  cutlets. 
 Dip the pieces of  veal  into a dish of the  flour , coat both sides and shake off the excess  flour . 
 The  flour  coating will help the  egg  coating to adhere. 
 Dip the pieces of floured  veal  into the dish of the beaten raw  egg  and coat both sides. 
 Press the pieces of  veal  into a bowl of fine white bread crumbs. 
 Coat both sides with crumbs. 
 Let the bread crumbed  veal  slices dry flat for at least ½ hour. 
 Heat the  butter  or  lard  in a large frying pan.  Lard  has the advantage of not scorching as easily as  butter  and  lard  makes a tastier browned coating. 
 Sauté the cutlets until they are a golden brown. 
 The thin cutlets will cook quickly, it will not take long. 
 Perhaps 4 minutes on each side. 
 You will know when to turn it over, the bottom breading will be a golden brown. 
 Do not cover finished cutlets with a cover. 
 The steam will soften the bread crumb coating and it will fall off.
