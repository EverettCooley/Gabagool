 About Self-rising flour : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Self-rising flour on Wikipedia 
 Self-rising or self-raising flour is "white" wheat flour that is sold premixed with chemical leavening agents. It was invented by Henry Jones. 
 Do not substitute self-rising flour for regular flour in a recipe, because you will end up with too much leavening in your dough! 
 
 Making your own : 
 Using a dry measure, measure the desired amount of flour into a separate container. 
 For each cup of  all-purpose flour , add 1½ teaspoons of  baking powder  and ½ teaspoon of  salt . 
 Mix to combine.
