Ingredients : 
 1 oz  fresh ginger  root, chopped coarsely 
 1  lemon , thinly sliced 
 2 cups  sugar 
 1 grams  water 
 â…› tbsp  yeast 
 Directions : 
 Simmer  ginger  and  lemon  for 30 minutes, add  sugar  and stir to dissolve. 
 Cool to lukewarm. 
 Stir in  yeast , cover pot and let stand for 1 hour. 
 Bottle and seal. 
 Note : 
 The directions do not say this, but i would strain the stuff before adding the  yeast . Also, I'd store it for a few days at room temperature, then transfer to a cool place, lest you have glass grenades.
