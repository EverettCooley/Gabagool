Red curry  (Thai แกงเผ็ด; IPA: [kɛːŋ pʰet]) (lit: spicy curry) is a popular Thai dish consisting of curry paste to which coconut milk is added. Despite the name, this curry does not contain any curry powder or dried spices. The base is properly made with a mortar and pestle, and remains wet throughout the preparation process. The main ingredients are garlic, shallots, red chillies, galangal, shrimp paste, salt, kaffir lime peel and lemongrass. Common additives are fish sauce, Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, thai basil, and meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, or more often duck. Tofu, meat analogues or vegetables such as pumpkin can be substituted as a vegetarian option. This dish normally has a thick, soup-like consistency and is served in a bowl and eaten with steamed rice. The standard red curry paste contains shrimp paste, which renders it inappropriate for vegetarians. There is, however, vegetarian red curry pastes available. Although red curry is a red coloured curry, it is incorrect to call it แกงแดง (Kaeng Daeng) ("lit: red curry")
