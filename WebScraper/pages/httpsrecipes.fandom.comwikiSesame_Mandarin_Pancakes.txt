 Description : 
 These pancakes can be made ahead and frozen. If using in sweet  red bean paste  pancakes, bring back to room temperature before cooking with the  red bean paste . Otherwise, reheat before serving.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 ¾ to 1 cup boiling  water , as needed 
 3 tablespoons  sesame oil , or as needed 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, add the boiling  water  to the  flour  and begin stirring it in immediately. 
 Knead the warm dough until you have a smooth dough. 
 Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes. 
 Turn the rested dough out onto a floured surface. 
 Cut the dough in half. 
 Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll each half out until it is ¼-inch thick. 
 Use a cookie cutter to cut out 3-inch circles of dough. 
 Use a pastry brush to brush ½ teaspoon of  sesame oil  over the top of 2 dough circles. 
 Lay one pancake on top of each other, so that the oiled sides are together (don't worry if one of the edges hangs over the other). 
 Roll out the pancakes to form a 6-inch circle. 
 Continue with the remainder of the pancakes. 
 Use a damp towel to cover the prepared pancakes and keep them from drying out while making the remainder. 
 Heat a heavy frying pan over low heat. 
 Add one of the pancake pairs and cook until browned on both sides (about 3 minutes altogether; the second side will cook more quickly than the first side). 
 Remove the paired pancakes from the pan and pull them apart. 
 Continue with the remainder of the pancakes. 
 Serve immediately.
