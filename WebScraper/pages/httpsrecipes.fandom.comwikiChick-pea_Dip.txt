Like tehina, hummus was brought to Israel by Jews from Arab countries, though today it is everyone's favorite. It tastes best when eaten with fresh, warm pita bread.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups canned  chick-peas , drained juice of 2  lemons 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp  cumin 
 3 tbsp pure  tahini  paste or 1 cup  tehina 
 2  garlic  cloves, mashed 
 2 – 3 tbsp  oil 
 parsley  (for garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Place all the ingredients in a food processor or blender, mix until  chick-peas  are smooth. 
 Refrigerate hummus in a covered container. 
 Serve well-chilled, with chopped  parsley  on top. 
 If desired, reserve ¼ cup unmashed  chick-peas  and sprinkle on top. 
 More  garlic  may be added, if desired. 
 If pita is not available, crackers or thick slices of French or  Italian bread  may be used.
