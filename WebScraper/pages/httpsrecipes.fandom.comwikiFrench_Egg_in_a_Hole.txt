 Description : 
 The "Egg in a Hole" is a great comfort food. It's fried, it's simple to make and it tastes somewhat delicious. It's not entirely healthy, but it's not entirely terrible for you. For those of us living on a college budget with limited time to spend on a meal, this makes a great snack or breakfast for those high octane weeks. This recipe mixes in a bit of "French Toast" and makes a great "hybrid."
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  egg 
 2 slices of bread 
 olive oil 
 milk  /  soy milk 
 vanilla extract 
 black pepper 
 your choice of spices 
 Directions : 
 Crack egg into a bowl or glass 
 Tear holes into the two slices of bread, tear and crumple the removed bread your tear out and place it into the egg in the glass 
 Add 4 tablespoons of milk to the egg and bread 
 Add a dash of vanilla extract to the egg and bread 
 Beat the egg, bread, milk and vanilla until it is worked together well. 
 Place olive oil in the skillet and place one or both slices of bread in the heated oil and pour half of the egg/bread mix into the hole of each bread slice. 
 sprinkle/grind black pepper onto the tops. 
 The trick here is to cook them on medium heat over a span of 20 or so minutes (usually 10 minutes per side) to crisp the bread and cook the egg thoroughly. Of course, you can cook it to your own preference. 
 Flip once the egg in the middle has attained a stiffness allowing you to flip it. 
 Once finished: eat it. Enjoy it. And I suggest a bit of ketchup with it.
