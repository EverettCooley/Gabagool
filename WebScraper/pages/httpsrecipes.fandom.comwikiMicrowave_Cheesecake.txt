 Ingredients : 
 Use a 13x9x2 microwave safe dish.
 
 Crust : 
 2 cups  graham cracker  crumbs 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 ½ cup  butter 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon 
 Filling : 
 1½ lbs  cream cheese 
 1 cup  sugar 
 5  eggs 
 ½ tsp  vanilla 
 Topping : 
 5 cups  sour cream 
 3 tsp  vanilla 
 ⅔ cups  sugar 
 Directions :

 Combine crust ingredients. 
 Mix well and pat firmly on bottom of pan. 
 Cook on high for 2 minutes. 
 Filling : 
 Beat  cream cheese  till smooth. 
 Add  eggs  one at a time, mixing after each till well blended. 
 Add  sugar  and  vanilla  and beat well. 
 Pour into crust and bake in micro on high for 15 minutes (turn every 4 minutes to ensure even baking). 
 In the meantime make topping. 
 Topping : 
 Combine  sour cream ,  sugar  and  vanilla , blending well. 
 Pour mixture over  cheese  cake and micro 1 minute 30 seconds. 
 Remove and chill. 
 The cake will look lumpy but it smooths out when in the fridge. 
 If not then taste won't be affected at all. 
 Notes : 
 Before serving I top with canned  blueberry  pie filling or  cherry  pie filling or I make my own by slicing (very thin)  kiwi ,  strawberries ,  blueberries ,  peaches  or  nectarines  etc. If you make 2 like I usually do for a party then you can make party colors. Fourth of July...1  cherry  pie filling and 1  blueberry  pie filling.
