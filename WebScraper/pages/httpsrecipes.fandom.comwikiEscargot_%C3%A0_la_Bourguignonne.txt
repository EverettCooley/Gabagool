Description : 
 The simple and classic method for escargot. :) This is the way they are prepared at 13 Coins in Seattle.
 
       Escargot à la Bourguignonne     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  butter , softened 
 ¼ cup  parsley , finely chopped 
 2  shallots , minced well 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced well 
 2 tablespoons  brandy 
 32 canned French  snails 
 32 snail shells 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 °F. 
 Combine the  butter ,  parsley , shallots,  garlic , and  brandy  in a bowl and blend well. 
 Place a snail in each shell and fill the cavity with the seasoned  butter  (if you do not have shells, you can use escargot baking dishes - this is actually how i prefer to make them. Most of such dishes hold 6 escargot apiece). 
 Place on a baking pan and bake for twelve minutes. 
 Serve hot, as an appetizer, on individual snail dishes - or on small folded napkins on plates, to keep the shells from sliding about. 
 Also, small silver forks to easily eat them with are a good idea. 
 Make sure to have plenty of good bread alongside, to mop up the delicious  butter  sauce! :). 
 Also good with a bit of Parmesan sprinkled on top of each.
