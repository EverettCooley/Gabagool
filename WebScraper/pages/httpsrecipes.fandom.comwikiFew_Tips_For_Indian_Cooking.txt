1.  flour  is rarely used as a thickening agent in India. Many dishes
depend on pastes such as  cashew  nuts,  onions  and  coconut  to thicken
sauces. 2. When making a paste, grind ingredients such as  Onion ,
 ginger  and  garlic  with a dash of  water . This ensures a silky-smooth
finish. 3. If you like a smooth-textured  dhal , blend plain-cooked
 Lentils  in a blender before returning to the pan.
