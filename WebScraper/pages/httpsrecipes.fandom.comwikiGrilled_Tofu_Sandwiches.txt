Description : 
 Makes 2 sandwiches.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 (1-inch) slabs marinated  firm tofu 
 4 slices white or whole wheat bread 
 mayonnaise 
 horseradish , to taste 
 1 large  tomato , sliced 
 salt  and  pepper 
 lettuce 
 Thinly sliced  red onions  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Be sure to use the firm, Chinese-style  tofu  rather than the soft or  regular tofu . 
 It tastes best after it has been marinated for several days. 
 Prepare the grill if you are grilling the  tofu , and grill it on both sides, about 6 inches above the coals, until it is well-browned and a little crispy. 
 Otherwise, broil the  tofu  on both sides. 
 Spread the bread with  mayonnaise  and horseradish to taste. 
 Slice the  tofu  in half, crosswise, to make pieces ½-inch thick, and cut the pieces to fit the bread. 
 Arrange the  tomato  slices on the  tofu , and  salt  and  pepper  them; add the  onion  if desired. 
 Cover with the  lettuce  and another slice of bread.
