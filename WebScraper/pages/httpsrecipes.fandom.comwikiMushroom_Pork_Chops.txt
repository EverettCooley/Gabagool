 Ingredients : 
 4  pork chops 
 1 can condensed  cream of mushroom  soup 
 1 can  mushroom  slices, drained well, dried on paper towel 
 ¼ cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Brown the chops in a skillet, drain off any fat. 
 Stir in soup,  water , and mushrooms. 
 Cover, cook on low heat about 45 minutes or until chops are tender.

 I have been known to add some minced  garlic  and  chili flakes  along with a few handfuls of fresh  mushrooms  to the skillet when i stir in the soup. 
 Rice  or  noodles  are a nice side.
