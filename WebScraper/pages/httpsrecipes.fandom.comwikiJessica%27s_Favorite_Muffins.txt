Description : 
 Makes 12 muffins. 
 Ingredients : 
 2¼ cups  oat bran 
 1 tbsp  baking powder 
 ¼ cup  honey 
 1 cup  blueberries 
 2  bananas 
 1¼ cup  skim milk 
 2  egg whites 
 2 tbsp  corn syrup 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 425°F. 
 Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. The  blueberries  too, it keeps them from staining the ingredients. 
 Mash the  bananas  in a separate bowl and mix the  milk ,  egg whites ,  honey , and  corn syrup  together, then blend with the dry ingredients. 
 Line muffin pans with paper baking cups, and fill with batter. 
 Bake about 15 minutes. 
 Hints : 
 I found that if you try to eat these straight from the oven they tend to stick to the paper. 
 They keep great for a week though in the frig without sticking. 
 If you eat 3 of these a day, it is suppose to be a sufficient amount of oatbran to significantly lower your cholesterol. 
 So far, I haven't seen much of a difference in my own, but that is just me and I am still trying. 
 Also, if you use a ¼ cup measure to scoop out the batter, it pretty much evenly distributes the batter among the 12 cups. 
 Variations : 
 I have tried the following substitutions in many combinations and these are still good. 
 
 Raisins instead of  blueberries  or no fruit at all 
 ¼ cup  brown sugar  instead of ¼ cup honey 
 no  bananas 
 one  banana 
 2 tbsp of  canola  for 2 tbsp of  corn syrup  although I wouldn't recommend this for obvious reasons. 
 Also, you could try 2 cups of oat bran and ½ cup  apple  fiber. I have not tried this yet, but will the next time I make muffins. Apple  fiber is an even better fiber than oatbran, and therefore even better for lowering LDL and raising HDL! i hope you enjoy these!
