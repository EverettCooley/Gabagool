 Source: Waldine van Geffen
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp  molasses 
 3 raw  egg whites 
 1 cup dark  raisins 
 1½ tsp  vanilla 
 1 cup  light brown sugar  — packed 
 1 cup  granulated sugar 
 ½ cup  non-fat dry milk  powder 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon 
 1½ tsp  baking powder 
 2½ cup Quaker brand  quick-cooking rolled oats 
 1 cup  all-purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 Put  molasses ,  egg  whites and  raisins  into blender and blend on high speed just to mince but not to puree (about 5 – 10 seconds). 
 Empty mixture into medium mixing bowl. 
 With mixer beat in on medium speed each of the remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition, adding both the  oats  and  flour  in small portions. 
 Switch to mixing spoon if dough becomes too stiff for mixer. 
 Lightly spray cookie sheet with pam and wipe off excess lightly with paper towel; any excess of the cookie sheet may burn while cookies are baking. 
 You need only a very light film of the PAM just to keep cookies from sticking. 
 Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for each cookie and place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. 
 Bake in preheated 350°F oven 6 – 8 minutes. Do not overbake. 
 Cool on paper towels, removing from cookie sheets carefully.
