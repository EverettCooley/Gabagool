Ingredients : 
 1 pkg (8½ oz)  chocolate wafers ; crushed (Oreos work well, filling and all) 
 6 tbsp  unsalted butter ; melted 
 2 pk (8 oz)  cream cheese ; softened (low fat works well) 
 ⅔ cup  sugar 
 3  eggs 
 12 oz  or  2 cups  semi-sweet chocolate , melted 
 1 cup  whipping cream 
 2 tbsp  unsalted butter ; melted 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 ½ cup  kahlúa 
 Directions : 
 Heat oven to 325°F. 
 In medium bowl, combine wafers and  butter , reserving 1 tablespoon of the crumbs for garnish. 
 Press remaining crumbs in bottom and 2 inches up sides of an ungreased 10-inch spring-form pan. 
 Refrigerate. 
 In a large bowl, combine  cream cheese  and  sugar ; beat until smooth. 
 Add  eggs  1 at a time, beating well after each addition. 
 Add melted  chocolate ; beat well. 
 Add remaining ingredients, and beat until smooth. 
 Pour into crust-lined pan. 
 Bake at 325°F for 55 to 65 minutes or until edges are set. 
 Center of cheesecake will be soft (to minimize cracking, place a shallow pan with about ¾ inch of hot  water  on the lower oven rack while baking). 
 Allow cheesecake to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the sides of the pan. 
 Allow the cheesecake to cool completely. 
 Garnish with the reserved crumbs (provided you can keep your spouse from eating them), and refrigerate (at least 2 – 3 hours, preferably overnight). 
 Keeps well in refrigerator for 3 days, probably longer.
