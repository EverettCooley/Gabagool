 Description : 
 In Cincinnati, dueling diner chains, one originally Greek and the other Bulgarian, have made a major industry out of serving a thin, sweet spiced  chili  that clearly suits the midwestern palate. If you're in a Texas state of mind, the stuff won't impress you much, but served in the traditional Cincinnati five way ( spaghetti  topped with  chili , beans, grated  cheese  and  onions ), it is a simple, hearty regional food at its best.

 Gilding the lily : 
 For more flavor, the  chili powder  can be increased by at least 50 percent. 
 For more fire, spicy V-8 vegetable juice can be substituted for the regular kind. 
 Two tbsp of unsweetenened  cocoa powder , added with the  chili powder , will cut the sweetness and add depth of flavor.  * Without beans, this makes a great  chili  dog topper.
