Description : 
 In Romanian: Cozonaci obisnuiti
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs / 1 kg  flour 
 10 oz / 300 g  sugar 
 1½ cups  milk 
 6  eggs 
 2 oz / 50 g  yeast 
 7 oz / 200 g  butter 
 2 tablespoons  oil 
 vanilla  stick 
 salt 
 egg  for washing the dough 
 grease for the pans 
 Directions : 
 Make a starter from  yeast  and a teaspoon of  sugar . 
 Mix until the consistency of  sour cream , add 2 – 3 tablespoons tepid  milk , a little  flour  and mix well; sprinkle some  flour  on top, cover and let sit in a warm place to rise. 
 Boil the  milk  with the  vanilla  stick (cut in very small pieces) and leave it on the side of the range, covered, to keep warm. 
 Mix the  yolks  with the  Sugar  and  salt , then slowly pour the tepid  milk , stirring continuously. 
 Place the risen starter in a large bowl and pour, stirring continuously, the yolk- milk  mixture and some  flour , a little at a time. 
 Then add 3 whipped  egg whites . When you finish this step, start kneading. 
 Knead, adding melted  butter  combined with  oil , a little at a time, until the dough starts to easily come off your palms. 
 Cover with a cloth and then something thicker (like a blanket). 
 Leave in a warm place to triple in bulk. 
 If during kneading the dough seems too hard, you may add a little  milk . 
 If, on the contrary, the dough seems too soft, you may add a little  flour . 
 When the dough has risen well, take a piece of it, place on the floured work surface, give it the desired shape (round, oval, braided, etc.) and place in the baking pan previously greased with  butter . 
 Let rise some more in the pan in a warm place. 
 Wash with  egg  and bake at medium heat. 
 Take out of the pan as soon as it is done, place on a cloth and let cool.
