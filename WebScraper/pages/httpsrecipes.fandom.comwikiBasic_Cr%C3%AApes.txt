Ingredients : 
 1 cup of  flour 
 3  eggs , lightly beaten 
 3 tablespoons of  vegetable oil  (such as  canola oil ) 
 Dash of  salt 
 ⅓ cup of  water 
 1 cup of  milk 
 Directions : 
 Blend all ingredients in a blender for about 45 seconds, let sit for a half hour. 
 Heat a griddle or similar pan on medium high heat and spray with nonstick oil. 
 Pour ¼ cup of the mixture at a time on the pan. Normally for traditional crepes you should spread the crepes thin, but you can skip this step to result in smaller, but thicker and richer pancakes. 
 Cook on one side for approximately 20 seconds, flip and cook for approximately 10 seconds.
