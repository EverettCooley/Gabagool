 Ingredients:    
 The soup 
 6 cups chicken stock
 2 pkges frozen minced   molokhia (thawed)
 2 tablespoons olive oil, butter, or any cooking oil
 3 cloves garlic, minced
 1 teaspoon ground coriander
 1 teaspoon salt  
  
 The onion dressing (optional)  
 1 medium onion chopped
 ½ cup vinegar  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    Instructions:  
 Over high heat, bring the chicken stock to a near boil in a large pot. Add the molokhia, stirring well. Reduce heat and simmer. The molokhia will simmer for about twenty minutes. (Allow an extra ten if frozen molokhia is not completely thawed.) After the chicken stock and molokhia have simmered for about ten minutes, heat the oil (or butter) in a skillet.
 On a cutting board, using either the back of a spoon or a sharp knife, grind the garlic, ground coriander, and the salt together into a paste. Fry the mixture in the oil for 2-4 minutes, stirring constantly, until the garlic is slightly browned. After the garlic has been browned and the molokhia is nearly done (after it has been simmering for about twenty minutes and has broken down to make a thick soup), add the garlic mixture and the oil it was fried in to the simmering molokhia. Stir well.Adjust seasoning with salt to taste. 
 Serve immediately hot, on a bed of white rice accompanied with boiled chicken (if desired). 
 Typically, Egyptians sprinkle over their molokhia plate 1 or 2 tablespoons of onion dressing, but usually kids don’t appreciate that. If you want to try it, prepare a small bowl of dressing just before serving the molokhia. The onion dressing must be made at the last minute, otherwise the onions get soggy (and they should remain crunchy).
