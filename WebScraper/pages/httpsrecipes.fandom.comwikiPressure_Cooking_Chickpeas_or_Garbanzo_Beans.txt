These round beans are high in fat, keep their unique shape when cooked, and they are usually pale yellow in color, but they can also be found in red, black, and brown. Mild and sweet flavor with good protein and iron. Add to salads, soups, and pasta dishes. Purï¿½e into hummus with tahini with garlic, lemon juice, sea salt and olive oil.
