 Description : 
 We call this Albert's soup because my husband's work colleague, Albert, told us about it, but it has become a real favourite here. As simple as this soup sounds, it really doesn't need  any  enhancement! This recipe is also very easy to scale up or down.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 – 4  red bell peppers  (however many you like) 
 6  plum tomatoes  (an equal amount to the peppers) 
 3 cups of  Fridge-cleaner Vegetable Stock  (or your favourite stock) 
 romano  cheese, thinly sliced (a slice or 2 per bowl) 
 (optional)  garlic 
 (optional)  basil , julienned 
 Directions : 
 Half the tomatoes 
 Place face up on a roasting pan along with whole pepper (and garlic if you are using any) 
 Roast until the either the peppers or the tomatoes start becoming blackened 
 Remove from the oven 
 Remove the skins from the tomatoes and peppers 
 Purée along with any juice from the roasting process and the stock 
 Add salt and pepper to taste 
 Heat the soup if necessary (my husband insisted on this step) 
 Serve with a slice of romano cheese in each bowl and (optionally) some julienned basil
