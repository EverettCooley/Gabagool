Ingredients : 
 2½ cups dried  black beans , soaked-overnight 
 1 large or 2 small  ham hocks 
 3 to 3.5 quarts  water 
 3 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 to 3 large  onions 
 4 cloves  garlic 
 3 small [f[fresh chile pepper|fresh green peppers]] -  jalapenos  preferred 
 8 berries  allspice  coarsely-crushed 
 2 tsp  brown sugar  (or 1 tsp of  molasses ) 
 3 tbsp  tomato paste 
 ¾ cup  crème fraîche  or  sour cream 
 salt 
 grated rind and juice from one  lemon 
 Directions : 
 Put the drained  beans  and hock in a very large pan, cover with the cold  water  and bring gradually to a boil. 
 Leave to simmer while you prepare the other ingredients. 
 In a frying pan heat the  olive oil , then gently fry the  onion ,  garlic  and  chile  with the  allspice  and  lemon  rind, stirring occasionally, until the  onions  are translucent. 
 Add this mixture to the  beans  and go on simmering for 2 hours, by which time the  beans  should be tender. 
 At this point add the  sugar ,  lemon juice , and  tomato  puree. 
 Cook for another 30 minutes. 
 Add  salt  if necessary. 
 Remove the hock, and pick off any meat. 
 If you would like a smooth soup, as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and return with the meat to the pan. 
 Otherwise, for a rougher texture crush with a  potato  masher. 
 If the mixture seems too thick at this stage, add more  water  and bring back to the boil for a minute or two.
