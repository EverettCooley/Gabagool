 Description : 
 Rice and beans - Haiti’s National Dish
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup dried  red kidney beans 
 3 tbsp  lard  or  margarine 
 1½ tsp  salt 
 6 – 8 cups  water 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 2 cups uncooked  long-grain white rice 
 Directions : 
 In a large sieve or colander wash the  beans  under running  water  until the draining  water  runs clear. 
 Transfer them to a heavy 3-4 quart saucepan, add ½ tsp of the  salt  and ground  pepper , and pour in 6 cups of  water . 
 Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to low, and simmer partially covered for about 1½ hours, or until the  beans  are tender but still intact. 
 Drain in a sieve, reserving liquid. 
 Melt 2 tbsp  margarine  or  lard  in a heavy skillet. 
 Drop in the  beans  and stir until  beans  are heated through. 
 Watch carefully for any sign of burning. 
 Put the  beans  aside. 
 Measure the cooking liquid and add enough  water  to make 4 cups. 
 In a heavy 2½ -3 quart saucepan, melt 1 tbsp of the  lard  over moderate heat. 
 When it is very hot but not smoking, add the  rice  and stir for 1 or 2 minutes, until the  grains  turn somewhat milky and opaque. 
 Stir in the 4 cups of reserved liquid and  water , the remaining tsp of  salt  and ground  pepper  to taste and bring to a hard boil. 
 Reduce the heat, add the cooked  beans , cover tightly, and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point. 
 Simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the  rice  is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. 
 Taste for seasonings and set aside off the heat, partially covered to keep the  rice  warm. 
 Fluff the  rice  and  beans  with a fork and serve hot.
