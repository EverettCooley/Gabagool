Ingredients : 
 1 lb each of  currants  and seedless  raisins 
 4 oz mixed  peel 
 the  juice  and  rind  of 1 lemon 
 1 tsp  mixed spice 
 1 tsp  nutmeg 
 1 lb  butter 
 1 lb  brown sugar 
 5  eggs 
 4 oz  golden syrup  (treacle) 
 6 oz  flour 
 1 lb brown  breadcrumbs 
 1 lb  vegetarian suet 
 Â¼ pint of either  brown ale ,  stout  or  cider 
 1 cup of either  wine ,  sherry  or  rum 
 3 tbsp  milk 
 Directions : 
 Wash and dry fruit. 
 Fold butter and sugar together in a large bowl until soft, adding eggs one by one. 
 Stir in the syrup, grated rind and lemon juice, sifted flour, spices, breadcrumbs, suet, fruit and peel. 
 Mix well, adding enough liquid and milk to blend. 
 Cover and let stand overnight. 
 The next day, grease 2-pint size "pudding cups" (or any other baking cups), and place a circle of greased pastry paper on the bottom of each cup. 
 Divide the pudding mixture equally and place in the cups, covering the top with more paper and damp tea towels (tie these securely with a knot to keep steam in). 
 Steam for six hours in a steamer, or in a large pot on the stove. 
 Remove from the heat and cover with damp tea towels. 
 These puddings can be kept for up to a year (and are said to be better with age). 
 As required, re-steam to heat. 
 These puddings are traditionally brought to the table with flaming brandy, and served with thick cream.
