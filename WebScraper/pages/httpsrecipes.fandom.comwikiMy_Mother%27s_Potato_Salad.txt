 6 to 8 Red Bliss or  Yellow Finn potatoes  or other new waxy  potatoes  (about ¾ pound) 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ½ cup  shallot - parsley   vinaigrette  or more to taste 
 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Scrub the  potatoes  under cold running  water . 
 Place in a medium-size saucepan and cover with cold  water . 
 Add the  salt  and bring to a boil. 
 Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes. 
 Drain. 
 As soon as the  potatoes  are cool enough to handle, peel them and slice or cube them into a salad bowl. 
 While they are still warm, pour the  shallot  vinaigrette over them so they can absorb the flavors of the vinaigrette.
