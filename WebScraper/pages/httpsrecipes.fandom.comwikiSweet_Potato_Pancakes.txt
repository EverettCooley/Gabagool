 1 cup finely shredded  onions 
 1 tsp salt-free herb  seasoning 
 1⅔ cup unbleached  flour 
 ⅓ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf  parsley

 ¼ cup  lemon juice 
 1½ cups  egg substitute 
 6 tsp  canola oil , divided

 In a large bowl, mix the sweet potatoes, zucchini, onions, lemon juice, herb blend, egg, flour, and parsley. 
 In a large no-stick frying pan or griddle over medium-high heat, warm 2 tsp of the oil. 
 Drop a large Tbsp of the batter into the pan and spread it with a spatula to form a thin pancake. Add more batter to fill the pan without crowding the pancakes. 
 Cook for about 2 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Repeat, adding the remaining 4 tsp oil as needed, until all the batter has been used.
