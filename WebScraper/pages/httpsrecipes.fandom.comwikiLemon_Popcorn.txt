Ingredients : 
 6 cups popped popcorn (you can use kettle corn but I just used plain popcorn). 
 1 bag white chocolate chips 
 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 
 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
 Lemon Glaze 
 1/4 cup butter 
 1 tablespoon milk 
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar 
 1 teaspoon lemon extract 
 3 drops lemon food coloring 
 Instructions : 
 Pour 6 cups of popped popcorn into a large bowl. 
 In a small bowl, pour white chocolate chips and microwave in 30 second increments stirring in between until smooth. 
 Pour in vegetable oil and mix until combined to make mixture smoother, and easier to pour. 
 Pour the melted chocolate over the popcorn and mix in carefully so the white chocolate evenly covers the popcorn. 
 Spread the chocolate covered popcorn out on a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil until chocolate hardens. 
 In a clean medium sized bowl, melt the butter until it is almost complete liquid. 
 Add the milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar. 
 Mix until it creates a thick glaze. 
 Add the lemon extract and food coloring. 
 Mix until it is fully combined and the flavor and color is all mixed together. 
 For a brighter yellow glaze, you can add a few more drops of food coloring. 
 Drizzle the glaze over the white chocolate hardened popcorn. 
 Let the glaze harden and enjoy!
