Ingredients : 
 Rye Bread 
 Olive Oil 
 Pastrami 
 Swiss Cheese 
 Knockwurst 
 Mustard 
 Instructions : 
 Take a nonstick saucepan and slightly grill slices of pastrami and split knockwurst in extra virgin olive oil on a medium-heat, for about 2 minutes. 
 In the same pan, slightly toast the freshly baked rye bread slices to give them a little crisp, toast each side for about 30 to 45 seconds on low-heat. 
 Take a small pan and place the bread pieces on it. 
 Place pastrami evenly on top of both toasted slices of rye bread. 
 Now lay down slices of Swiss cheese in a single layer atop pastrami. 
 Now put the split knockwurst long ways on top of the Swiss cheese. 
 Put the pan with the sandwich in a preheated hot oven for about 2 minutes or until the cheese melts. (preheat the oven at around 260Â° F) 
 Serve immediately with brown mustard and French fries on the side.
