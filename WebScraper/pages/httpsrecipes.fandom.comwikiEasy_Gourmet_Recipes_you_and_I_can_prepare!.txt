So, you don't think you can find easy gourmet recipes? Yes, you can! While most people think that gourmet recipes are hard to make, time consuming, or too expensive, you can find things that are gourmet and easy to make. You just need to look in the right places and know what you are looking for! First of all, finding information on gourmet recipes on the Internet is easy to do. Just search your favorite recipe websites or just use a search engine like Google or Yahoo. If you do not have web access, going to the library for the information will also work. The library contains many types of books or even CD ROMs on cooking. Most importantly, both of these options result in free recipes! 
The next question to ask yourself is what type of gourmet cooking are you looking to do. Are you looking to spice up a crockpot recipe you already have? Are you looking for special cookie recipes or Christmas recipe? Maybe even a gourmet chicken recipe? Are you planning on dining on a special day or for a special reason? All these questions will give you an idea of what you are looking to make or do. Make sure to know the tastes of those you are cooking for as well. Many people like to go to restaurant solely because they love the way a certain chef prepares their food and wish they could do the same thing at home. You can! You just need to knowledge of how to do this! Sometimes, gourmet meals are made from specialty store bought foods. But, in the day and age we live in, gourmet foods can be found in most large supermarkets across the country. 
 Spices that were hard to find even 10 years ago are available regularly. Many times you can also find gourmet meals already prepared at these same supermarkets. You can perhaps purchase a nicely made New York Style Cheesecake or Chocolate Mouse from your local bakery. But, if you are wanting to purchase your own produce and meats, do so knowing what cuts are correct for the recipe you have chosen. For instance, a chicken recipe may call for boneless thigh pieces or only white meat. Picking produce that is fresh, ripe, and the tastiest will contribute to the overall flavor of the finished food. 
 In order to know what to use and what to buy, make sure to choose recipes that give enough details. If they don't, research on the Internet or your local library for more information. You can make good, but easy gourmet recipes if you know what you are looking for and have the knowledge of what you need and want. Researching information you do not have is the most important first step.
