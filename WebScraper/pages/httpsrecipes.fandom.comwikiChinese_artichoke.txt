 About Chinese artichoke : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Chinese Artichoke on Wikipedia 
 Out of the several unrelated species of vegetable all called artichokes, the Jerusalem artichoke is an unusual sight on the allotment or vegetable plot, but the Chinese artichoke or knotroot is distinctly rare. From a cultivation standpoint this is rather odd — the Chinese artichoke is easier to grow, requiring neither staking nor earthing-up. The primary reason that Chinese artichokes are so unpopular is the nature of the tubers — small, convoluted and indented, so that it is the cook rather than the gardener or the family who finds this vegetable extraordinarily frustrating to clean. That Chinese artichokes are available only from Fall until early Spring, and the root's short shelf life out of the ground are two other important reasons for their rarity in American cuisine.
 The flavour of Chinese artichokes is delicate and delicious — treat as jerusalem artichokes in cooking.
 In Chinese and Japanese cuisine, the Chinese artichoke is used primarily for pickling, either in wine or vinegar, often for medicinal purposes. Ancient Chinese medicinal texts forbid the consumption of Chinese artichokes with catfish for fear of causing severe stomach cramps. In French cuisine, especially in Chinoiserie and Japonisme imitative cuisines, Chinese artichokes are often sauteed for soups, or roasted with meats, especially pork.
