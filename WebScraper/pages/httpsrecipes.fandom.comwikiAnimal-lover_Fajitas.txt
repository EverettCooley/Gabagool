 1 pkg store bought fajita mix

 Add the  tofu  and briefly brown over medium low heat. Once browned, set aside. 
 In the same skillet, add the  onions  and saute until translucent. 
 Add all other vegetables and cook until tender. Add the  tofu  and stir in fajita mix. 
 Serve on soft tortillas with  lettuce ,  tomatoes  and Tofutti  sour cream .
