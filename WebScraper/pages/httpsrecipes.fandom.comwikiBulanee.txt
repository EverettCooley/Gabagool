Wrap in plastic film and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Cut most of the green tops from  leeks , halve lengthwise and rinse well to remove all traces of soil between leaves. Remove roots and dry  leeks  with paper towels. Place flat on board, cut along length at 5 mm (1/4 inch) intervals than across to dice. Measure in cup measure and place in bowl. Add  salt  and  chili pepper  and knead with hand to soften  leeks . Stir in  oil . Roll pieces of dough into balls the size of a large  hazelnut  and roll thinly into a 10 cm (4 inch) circle. Alternatively roll out dough and cut into 10 cm (4 inch) rounds. Place about 2 teaspoons  leek  filling in centre of circle, moisten pastry half way round edge of circle and fold pastry over filling. Press edge to seal well, and using the edge of a thimble, (the traditional method) or a  coffee  spoon make little crescent- shaped marks around the edge, or press with fork. Fry 3 or 4 at a time in hot  oil  until golden brown, turning to brown evenly. 
 Drain on paper towels and serve hot or warm.
