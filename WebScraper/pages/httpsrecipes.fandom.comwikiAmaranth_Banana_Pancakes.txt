Ingredients : 
 1 ⅞ cup  amaranth flour 
 1 tablespoon  egg replacer 
 ½ teaspoon  guar gum , if desired 
 2 ¼ cups  water 
 2  bananas 
 honey, optional 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dough. Prepare a non-stick skillet. 
 Pour pancakes onto hot skillet. Begin to cook. 
 Add  banana  slices so that they still sink in partly but still show their faces through on the top. 
 Turn pancakes when ready, so that  banana  slices will come in contact with the skillet. 
 When done, serve with  banana  slices facing up. Drizzle with honey, if desired. 
 Notes : 
 Bananas  will be warm and sweeten the pancakes. These types of pancakes are fun for children and the little kid in each of us.
