Ingredients : 
 2 hard-cooked  eggs , peeled, chilled 
 1 tbsp  green onion , finely chopped 
 1 tbsp  celery , finely chopped with leaves 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 dash freshly ground  pepper 
 3 tbsp  Lemon Mayonnaise 
 ½ tsp hot pepper  prepared mustard  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Finely dice the  eggs ; mix thoroughly with all other ingredients. 
 Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or until flavors are well blended. 
 Mound on crisp  lettuce , garnished with a dash of  paprika , and serve as a salad. 
 This also may be used as a spread for crackers (I would use for a sandwich to go with a salad on a hot, hot day). 
 Also, topping with mustard is good for an extra kick of flavor.
