 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  black beans , cooked or canned 
 1 tsp  garlic powder 
 1 tsp  chili powder 
 1 tsp  cumin , powdered 
 2 tbsp  lemon juice 
 Â¼ tsp  red pepper , powdered (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Place all the ingredients in a blender and run at "high" until smooth. 
 It may be necessary to stop the blender from time to time, and mix the ingredients with a spoon or spatula to ensure that all the ingredients are thoroughly and uniformly mixed. (The amount of seasoning is often subjective; so, we suggest you taste a little and add additional seasoning if necessary) when finished, scoop out the bean dip into a bowl and place it in the center of a large platter. 
 Cut the veggies into 2" lengths and split as necessary to keep bite sized. 
 We suggest  broccoli  florets,  carrots ,  cauliflower  florets,  celery ,  cucumbers , green and red  bell peppers , scallions, etc. 
 Arrange the veggies around the dip on the platter in two piles for each variety of veggie, so that they are opposite each other. 
 This way everyone sitting around the table can reach some of each. 
 Enjoy!.
