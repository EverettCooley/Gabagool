Description : 
 This is based on Georgian (as in post-Soviet) cuisine, but it’s my own recipe, which means that it’s very flexible with ingredients and quantities. It goes great with grilled vegetables, especially eggplant. Garnish with a few pomegranate seeds. I’ve also used it as a base sauce for frying up chicken and serving with saffron rice.
 
 Original recipe 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ pound  walnuts 
 2 cloves fresh  garlic  (or to taste) 
 ½ of a medium  yellow onion 
 virgin  olive oil 
 warm  water  (not boiling) 
 salt 
 pepper 
 ground  coriander 
 saffron  and fresh  parsley  to taste 
 Directions : 
 In a CuisinArt or using a hand blender (or mortar and pestle if you want the workout) combine walnuts, garlic, yellow onion, olive oil, and water. 
 Add salt, pepper, coriander, saffron, and parsley to taste. 
 Grind it up until the consistency is sauce-like and the taste is delicious.
