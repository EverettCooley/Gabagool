 Cream the butter and sugar together on medium high for 3-5 minutes until light and fluffy. add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on medium. 
 In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients (the flour, salt, and baking powder). Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture on low speed, 1/3 at a time, alternating with the milk. Finally, stir in the blackberries (and lemon juice and zest, if using) by hand. Transfer batter into prepared pan. 
 Bake 45-65 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Allow to cool in the pan for fifteen minutes, then carefully turn out onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool for 1 hour before topping with powdered sugar. 
 Serve plain or with whipped cream and fresh berries. Cake will keep well, tightly wrapped, for up to 4 days.
