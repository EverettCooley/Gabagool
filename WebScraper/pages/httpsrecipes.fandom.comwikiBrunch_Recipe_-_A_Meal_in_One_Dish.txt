 Description : 
 I made this recipe and it was amazing. The only problem that I had was in the not too precise explanation of the term “1 loaf of sour dough" The ratio of the loaf we had at the store was larger than the rest of the ingredients. I increased the ingredients according to what my family liked, omitting the red pepper and increasing the amount of olives. The taste and the presentation was a hit with my husband and we had 2 late lunches and one dinner out of the amount that I made. Add a salad and the meal is complete.
