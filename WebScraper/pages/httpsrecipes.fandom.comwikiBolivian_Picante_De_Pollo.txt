Ingredients : 
 3 cup broth or  water  2 spoonfuls  oil 
 Chicken  pieces 
 potatoes 
 chuno phuti 
 uncooked sauce 
 chopped  parsley 
 Directions : 
 In a large casserole put the  Chicken  pieces with all the other ingredients. Pour the broth or  water  until covering the ingredients completely. 
 Set to cook over high heat until it boils, and later over low heat for at least an hour and a half or until the  Chicken  is soft. Stir occasionally. 
 If while cooking the broth diminished much, add a little bit more of broth or  water  so that when serving there is enough liquid. 
 In a deep plate serve one piece of spicy  Chicken  with one boiled  Potato , cooked aside, chuno phuti and uncooked sauce on top. 
 Finally, sprinkle the chopped  parsley  on top of the spicy  Chicken .
