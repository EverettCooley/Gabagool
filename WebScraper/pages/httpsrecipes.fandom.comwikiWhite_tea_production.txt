The Fujian province in China is the most important white tea production area. White tea is a delicate and very appreciated tea, obtained from leaf buds that are covered with silver-white hairs. The white tea buds are plucked before they open in early spring and are then withered and dried slowly at low temperatures. White tea production differs from black tea, green tea and oolong tea production â€“ the leaf buds are only oxidized for a short while and the buds are never rolled. The main concern of the manufacturers is to obtain a white tea that has a natural sweetness found in the buds and a mild flavor. Seasoned tea drinkers will notice the lack of the grassy undertones that are mostly associated with the other tea types.
