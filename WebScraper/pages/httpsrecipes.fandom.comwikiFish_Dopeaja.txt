 After heating the  oil  add all the powder/paste spices and fry for a couple of minutes. 
 You might add a little bit of  water  if you are using powders only. 
 Make sure you don't burn the spices. 
 (include the  onion  pastes). 
 Add the shredded  onions  and the fish. 
 Add ½ cup of  water  and the  salt . 
 Cover the dish and medium-hi heat. 
 When the  water  has almost evaporated, add  tomatoes , cilantro, and the  onion  leaves. 
 Heat under low-medium heat till the  oil  starts to float.
