 About yellow summer squash : 
 Yellow summer squash (one of several cultivated Cucurbita pepo) is a type of yellow-coloured summer squash. It is also known as straightneck squash to distinguish it from its close relative, the yellow  crookneck squash . It has mildly sweet and watery flesh, and thin tender skins that can be left on the fruit for many types of recipes. 
 The squash grows on vined plants reaching 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) to 90 centimetres (3.0 ft) in height that thrive in mild weather. It is well known as an item in American cooking, and is often used in recipes interchangeably with  zucchini  in which it is fried, microwaved, steamed, boiled, or baked. A good yellow summer squash will be small and firm with tender skin free of blemishes and bruising. It is available all year long in some regions, but it is at its peak from early through late summer.
