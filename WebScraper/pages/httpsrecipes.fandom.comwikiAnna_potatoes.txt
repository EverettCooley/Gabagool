      Potatoes Anna     
 Namve Variations : 
 Pommes Anna 
 Description : 
 Pommes Anna or Anna potatoes, is a classic French dish of sliced, seasoned, layered  potatoes  cooked in a very large amount of melted  butter . The potatoes are usually baked in a straight-sided metal dish until golden brown. Then the potatoes are flipped onto a plate and slice like a pie. 
 Due to the high butter content (even though the butter is eventually discarded), and because the initial preparation is quite meticulous and labor intensive, they are seldom prepared today in their original fashion. There are numerous modern recipes that are somewhat easier to prepare and that use much less butter.
