 Description : 
 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  Eggplant 
 4 tbl soy sauce 
 1 tbl  cornstarch 
 3 tbl  Sugar 
 1/4 cup  distilled white vinegar 
 1/4 cup  water 
 1 tsp crushed dried red pepper 
 6 slices  ginger , about the size and thickness of a quarter 
 4 scallions, chopped, separate white and green parts 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut stem end off  Eggplant . Dice  Eggplant  into small cubes. 
 Sprinkle  Eggplant  with  salt  and place in a colander to drain. Let sit for 15 minutes. 
 Squeeze as much liquid out as possible. 
 In a small bowl, combine soy sauce,  Sugar ,  vinegar  and  water . 
 Heat 1 tbl dry  sherry  in a large skillet or wok. Add  red peppers  and stir. Add  ginger , white part of  scallion . 
 Stir fry briefly until  ginger  becomes fragrant. Add the squeezed  Eggplant  and saute approximately 8â€“10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until  Eggplant  is thoroughly cooked. 
 You shouldn't have any trouble with sticking because the  Eggplant  still has a bit of moisture in it but if it does, add a little bit of  water  or  sherry . 
 Add soy sauce mixture and cook over high heat until most of the liquid is evaporated and  Eggplant  is thoroughly coated with reduced sauce - about 5 minutes. 
 Combine 2 tbl  water  with  cornstarch . 
 Add chopped green part of scallions and  sherry  mixed with  cornstarch . Stir and cook until thick. 
 Serve hot over plain  rice . kwvegan vegan
