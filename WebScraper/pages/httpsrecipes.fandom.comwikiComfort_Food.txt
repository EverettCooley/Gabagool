 Description : 
 Here is the illustrated recipe and cooking instructions for a dinner you can cook up when you’ve run out of ideas - or you can’t be bothered to go out shopping for any fresh ingredients - or the shops have closed and you’ve not got a lot in your fridge. It is a delicious “comfort food” dish that is the sort of thing we in the Route79 household prepare when there’s nothing else to cook out in the house - except for the most basic of ingredients and a tactical tin of sardines! And I am calling it “Pilchard  rice ”.
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
       Ingredients     
 What you need is a couple of  onions , a couple of  potatoes  and a tin of sardines (pilchards - same thing) - but make sure you get the  tomato  version - not the “brine” version! You also need to have access to the basic set of spices
 
 Directions : 
 Place the nearly-full cup of  rice  (basmati) into a sieve and leave to rinse under a cold running tap for a few minutes. Then drain over the measuring cup. (You can peel the  onions  and  potatoes  whilst the  rice  is rinsing.)

 OK - so having peeled the  Onion  and  potatoes  - then open up the sardine tin and empty it into a deep dish - all the and juices - just pour it all out. Then take each piece of from the dish with a fork and a knife and place it onto plate - and slit it carefully into two - in order to remove the bone. Discard the bones in the original can. (Some people like to leave the bone in - it is very delicate is very edible as a good source of calcium - but I don’t personally like the texture.)
 
         Potateos and onions peeled and washed     
         Fish pieces with bones carefully removed     
 Then dice the  potatoes  and put them into a small pan for part-boiling. For convenience -boil some  water  in the kettle and when it’s done - pour it into the  Potato  pan and simmer for around 7 minutes. Also chop the  Onion  coarsely
 
         Half-boil the copped potato chunks     
         Chop the onions coarsely     
 Fry the  Onion  - and also defrost some chunks of frozen  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie from your freezer. (If you don’t have these then hard luck. Every 3 months or so you should go to your local Asian grocer and buy loads of fresh  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie (in bulk) - and then spend a Sunday morning peeling it all, washing it, and zapping it to a pulp in the food processor before spreading the pulp into freezer bags and freezing it. This is a very convenient way to have the essential ingredients to hand within seconds. You can do the same with coriander: especially at this time of the year - the local grocer will probably be selling 3-bunches for a pound - and these are HUGE bunches - not the measly, nicely-packaged stuff you get for £1.79 in Safeway - no: these bunches of coriander will be around 30 times as big - for about half the price. Just wash it all in a sink when you get it home and then discard any wilting leaves and finely chop it all up using a knife and then fill up a couple of freezer bags and chuck it in the freezer.)
 
         Thaw chunks of garlic ginger and green chillie     
         Fry the onion until they are translucentish     
 Whilst the  Onion  is cooking off - add some  jeera  ( cumin  seed) if you have some - as this will make it tastier. If not - don’t worry. Then stir in the  tomato  “juices” from the tin of sardines: the bits that were left in the deep dish after you removed all the bones
 
         Add some jeera(cumin seeds) to the onions whilst frying     
         After the garlic and ginger have cooked thru stir in the tomato sauce from the sardine tin     
 It is at this point that you need to add the spice: around 1 teaspon each of haldi ( turmeric ), red-chillie and ground coriander, two heaped teaspoons of  garam masala  - and around half a teaspon of  salt . Stir it all in on a powerful simmer so that the spices really fuse into the tomoato juice mixture. Do this for around 4 minutes or so.
 Then - after frying for a few minutes - add the drained part-boiled  Potato  chunks - give it a really good stir around - and then add the drained  rice :
 
         Stir in the part-boiled potatoes     
         Then add the drained rice     
 Stir it a bit - until everything is well coated. Then add about 1.5 times the volume of  rice  of  water  (approx. 1.5 cups) - stir it in - and bring to the boil on a really fierce flame.
 
         And then add the fish pieces     
         And some fresh coriander leaf - loads of it     
 Just before the mixture starts to boil - add the pieces - stirring really slowly and carefully so you don’t break them up too much. Then add some fresh chopped  coriander leaf  you have some: the more the merrier!
 Bring back to a fierce boil - and then when it starts to get really violent drop the flame down the LOWEST that you can get. Put the lid on (with the vent fully open) and let it simmer for around 25 mins.
 
         And the water then cover and simmer     
         Make sure it's on a really LOW flame     
 About halfway through - take off the lid and give the contents a gentle turning over. Put the lid back on and let it simmer for another 15 mins or so. (DONT KEEP TAKING THE LID OFF TO SEE HOW ITS GOING) Then - after half hour or so - it should be done - the  rice  will be all fluffy (not sloppy) - just put the lid on the pan slightly lop-sided and let it rest with the flame turned off for around 15 mins. After that it will be ready to serve!
 
         Stir gently halfway thru simmering     
         Should be done within 30 mins on VERY LOW flame
