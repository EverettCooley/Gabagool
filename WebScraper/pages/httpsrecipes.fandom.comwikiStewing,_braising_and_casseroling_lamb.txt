Stewing, braising and casseroling are all damp techniques of cooking that are cooked in the oven or on the hob. The meat is simmered gently at a low temperature with added liquid. Allow approximately 225-350g vegetables but is significant to use root vegetables cut into chunks per 450g meat and 150ml liquid where you may try stock, wine or beer. There are two methods of preparation:
-1. All the meat, vegetables and liquid are added to a large pan or ovenproof casserole dish. Cover and cook for the recommended time.
-2. The conventional 'sealing' method is where the meat and vegetables are browned in a little oil then the residual ingredients are added. You could as well try adding jars of shop bought sauces to make preparation actually fast. This method is perfect for making tasty curries, simply add a jar of shop bought curry sauce to some cubed meat and vegetables and cook for the calculated cooking time.
