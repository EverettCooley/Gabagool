 Ethiopian salads are far from complex creations. Salads are usually very basic combinations of many native vegetables along with a little oil or vinegar and a few seasonings. These are generally very light and not meant to be the center course of any meal, however, they are quite popular during Lent when Ethiopian Orthodox Christians refrain from eating meats of any form.
