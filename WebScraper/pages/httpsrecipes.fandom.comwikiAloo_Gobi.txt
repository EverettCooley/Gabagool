Description : 
 My turn to cook tonight - as always.  Aloo Gobi  this time. (Aloo= Potato  and Gobi= Cauliflower .)
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 1 large  cauliflower  - stripped of leaf, washed and broken into bite-sized florets 
 2 large  onions  chopped into coarse chunks 
 3 medium  potatoes , peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks 
 chunks of frozen, pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and  green-chillie 
 spices:  turmeric  (halidi),  garam masala ,  ground coriander ,  salt , dried  methi  ( fenugreek ) 
 seeds:  onion seed  and  cumin  ( jeera ) seeds. 
 some splashes of concentrated  lemon juice 
 a large karahi (large pot a bit like a wok) in which to pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of vegetable  oil 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  in the karahi until hot. Add the  Onion  and  cumin  seeds and watch them pop and fizzle for around 20 seconds. Then add the coarsely chopped  onions  and fry until they are translucent.
 
       Add the onion and jeera (cumin) seeds     
 Then add the pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie which you have stored away in your freezer - and stir fry until they are infused in the  oil . Then add the powdered spices: 3 teaspons of  garam masala , 2 teaspoons of ground coriander, 2 teaspoons of  turmeric  (haldi) and 1 teaspoon of  salt . Stir it all up until well mixed up.
 
       Fry the onions until translucent     
         Add the pulped ginger, garlic and chillie     
 Then add the chunks of  Potato  - stir until well coated in spices and then put the lid on the karahi and let it simmer on a very low flame for around 15 mins. This will soften the  Potato  a little. Then add the  Cauliflower  florets and stir until fully coated and yellow looking. Again: put the lid back on and let heat on low simmer for around 20 minutes more.
 
 
         Add the spices     
         Add the patato chunks     
 After that - stir gently but thoroughly and turn flame off - and sprinkle on a generous handfull of fresh  coriander leaf . Then put lid back on for around 10 minutes to rest. It’s then ready to serve!
 
         Add the cauliflower florets     
         Steam on low flame for around 20 minutes     
 Serve up with fresh roti (chapatti) or if you’re feeling lazy like me tonight - some warmed pitta breads - and a side salad of  onion ,  cucumber ,  tomato  and  carrot  all tossed in a few dashes of  vinegar . Simple - but heavenly.
 
         Sprinkle with coriander and serve

 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
