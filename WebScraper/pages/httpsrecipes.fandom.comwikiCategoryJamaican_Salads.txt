 As the Jamaican cuisine is poor in dishes based on red meat, the salad recipes are also in low number. Usually, in a typical cuisine, the salads ease the digestion of the foods that contain pork and meat. But the Jamaican cuisine features more dishes based on fish than on the meats mentioned before. Therefore, the importance of the salads in the Jamaican cuisine is diminished. However, there are a few salad recipes and the most important are: 
 
 Jamaican Sweet Potato Salad 
 Jamaican Chicken Salad 
 Jamaican Garden Salad 
 Jamaican Jerk Seasoning 
 The fact that the Jamaicans use fruits even in some of their salads is not unusual. Most frequently, people could find mangos in the Jamaican salad recipes.
