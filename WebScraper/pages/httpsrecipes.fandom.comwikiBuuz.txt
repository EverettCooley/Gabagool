 meat fillingÂ :
 
 Minced  Beef  or mutton 
 Medium  Onion 
 salt 
 Ground  pepper  (optional) 
 garlic  (optional) 
 Chopped herbs (optional) 
 5-spices (optional) 
 Dough
 
 Premium  wheat flour 
 A pinch of  salt 
 Lukewarm  water 
 
 
 Directions : 
 For the dough
 Dissolve a pinch of  salt  in lukewarm  water , mix in  flour  and knead into smooth soft dough. Leave the dough to rest. Knead again and cut into small pieces (the size depends on whether you like small or medium buuz). Roll the pieces into balls and leave them rest in a bowl. Sprinkle with  flour  to avoid from sticking together. 
 For the meat filling 
 Mince  Beef  or mutton. You can certainly use a Moulinex for this purpose; however, buuz will taste better if you do the mincing by hand using a sharp knife. Combine the meat in a bowl with minced  Onion , crushed  garlic  (optional), herbs (optional) and other seasonings. Add some  water  to make the filling juicy.
 The next stage is forming buuz. Roll out the dough ball into circles by leaving the center thicker than the edges. Put the meat filling in the center of the circle and start sealing the edges with your fingers. Sealing requires agility and skillfulness from your fingers. Each Mongolian family has its own style of sealing such as flower-like, canoe-shape or star-type.
