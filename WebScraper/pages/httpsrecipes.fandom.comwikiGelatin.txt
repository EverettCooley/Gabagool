 About Gelatin : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Gelatin on Wikipedia 
 Gelatin (also gelatine) is a translucent brittle solid substance, colorless or slightly yellow, nearly tasteless and odorless, which is created by prolonged boiling of animal skin, connective tissue or bones. It has many uses in food, medicine, and manufacturing. Substances that contain or resemble gelatin are called gelatinous. Gelatin is also known as E number E441.
 A thickening agent and food item produced as a tasteless, odorless, protein powder made from pigskin or from beef bones, cartilage, and tendons. It is widely used as a thickener for broths, soups, candy, desserts, syrups, sauces, jellies, gravies, meat dishes, and beverages. It can be added to become a binding agent for canned meats, cheeses, dairy foods, candy, and meat rolls. Used as a clarifier, gelatin is added to beer, juice, wine, and vinegar. It is also considered to be a whipping agent when added to chiffons, marshmallows, mousses, nougats, souffles and whipped cream to improve the resulting textures. Gelatin works well as an ingredient in foods that are formed into a shape that needs to be retained for appearance and presentation, such as icings and chiffons.
