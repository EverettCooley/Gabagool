Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 6  egg yolks 
 3  egg whites 
 2 cups  milk 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 the peel of 1  lemon 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 ¼ cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Prepare a caramel by adding the ¼ cup of  water  to ¾ cups of  sugar  in a small saucepan over medium to low heat. 
 Stir while cooking until the  sugar  starts melting. 
 Let it simmer. 
 Use a pastry brush dipped in  water  to wash the sides of the pan free of granular  sugar . 
 When  sugar  starts to thicken and turn brown remove from heat and add 2 cubes of  ice  to stop the cooking process, being very careful not to get burned with any splattering that may occur. 
 Coat a warm baking dish or round mold by pouring the caramel and swirl it around the sides and bottom. 
 Put the coated mold aside( by the way the mold should be 9 inches in diameter). 
 Now comes the good part. 
 In a saucepan bring to a boil the  milk  with the  lemon peel ,  cinnamon  stick and  salt . 
 When the mixtures starts to boil remove from heat and let it cool a little bit. 
 In a medium bowl beat lightly the  egg yolks ,  egg whites ,  vanilla  and  sugar  until well mixed. 
 Pour into the bowl the slightly cooled  milk  and strain the  egg  and  milk  mixture into the caramel coated mold.
