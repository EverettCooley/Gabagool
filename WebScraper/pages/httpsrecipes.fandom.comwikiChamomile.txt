 About Chamomile : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Chamomile on Wikipedia 
 German Chamomile (Matricaria recutita), also spelt camomile, is an annual plant of the sunflower family Asteraceae. Synonyms are: Chamomilla chamomilla, Chamomilla recutita (accepted name according to the Flora Europaea), Matricaria chamomilla, and Matricaria suaveolens.
 It usually grows near people all over Europe and temperate Asia. It is widely introduced in temperate North America and Australia. As the seeds need open soil to survive, it often grows near roads, around landfills and in cultivated fields as a weed.
 Resembling a daisy, this aromatic flower is dried and used to flavor chamomile tea, reputed to be a soothing drink. The flowers are also used as a fragrance in shampoos and other hair preparations.
