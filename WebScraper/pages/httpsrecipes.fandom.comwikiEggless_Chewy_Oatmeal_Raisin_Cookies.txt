Description : 
 This recipe calls for no eggs. If you have an egg allergy, want fat free cookies, or don't like eggs this recipe is right for you. No more buying expensive egg substitutes. The substitute is made with 3 simple common ingredients: baking powder, vinegar, and water. These cookies are quite good. The day I made them, they were gone within 2 hours.
