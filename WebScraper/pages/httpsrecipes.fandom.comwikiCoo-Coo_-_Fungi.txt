 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 15 okras soaked in 4 cups  water 
 1Â lb  cornmeal 
 6 cups  water 
 1 tsp  salt  or to taste 
 3 Tbs  margarine 
 1  Onion  chopped 
 5 cloves  garlic  minced 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wash the okras and cut off the heads and tails. Cut into cartwheels and place in a pot with 2 cups  water  and all the other ingredients except the  cornmeal . Bring to the boil and simmer for about 15 minutes. 
 In the meantime, place the  cornmeal  in a bowl and pour over 4 cups  water  to saturate the meal. Stir to make sure it is wet throughout. 
 After the 15 minutes pour out about three quarters of the okras and the cooking liquid and set aside. 
 Return the pot to a very low heat and pour in the wet  cornmeal . Stir constantly to break up any lumps. Add the reserved okras and liquid a little at a time stirring to make sure the mixture is smooth. A coo-coo stick is normally used for this purpose - it resembles a small cricket bat. 
 However, a wooden spoon also does the job quite well. 
 Continue to stir and cook on very low heat for about 10 minutes. When finished the Coo-Coo should be smooth and stiff. Transfer to a buttered dish.
