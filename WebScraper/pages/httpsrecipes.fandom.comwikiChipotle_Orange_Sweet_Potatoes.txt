 Heat oven to 375°F. 
 Bake sweet potatoes directly on oven racks for 1 hour, or until tender when pierced with a fork. 
 Remove potatoes from oven, slice in quarters. 
 Carefully slide the potato skins off and discard (careful—the potatoes are very hot!) 
 Place potatoes in a large bowl and mash. 
 Add 2 tablespoons of adobo sauce to the potatoes and blend thoroughly (if your tongue can take it and you want a more fiery and spicier dish, mix some chopped chipotle peppers into the potatoes). 
 Add the orange juice and salt.
