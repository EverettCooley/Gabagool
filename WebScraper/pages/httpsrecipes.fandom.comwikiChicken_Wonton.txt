Makes about 16 wonton
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped  shallot 
1 clove  garlic , finely chopped 
2  green onions 
8 ounces  Chicken  breast 
3 tablespoons  Peanut   butter  or sesame paste 
3 tablespoon shredded  carrot 
1 teaspoon green  curry  paste 
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
1 1/2 teaspoon  granulated sugar 
2 teaspoons  lime juice 
 oil  for deep-frying and stir-frying, as needed
 
 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Heat the wok over medium-high to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons  oil , 
drizzling it down the sides of the wok. When the  oil  is hot, add the 
shallots,  garlic  and  green onion . Stir-fry briefly, then add the  Chicken  meat and stir-fry on high heat until the  Chicken  changes color and is nearly cooked through.
 Stir in the remaining ingredients. Remove the wok from the burner and allow the mixture to cool. Set out the wonton wrappers with a small bowl filled with  water . Lay out 1 wonton wrapper, and place approximately 1 tablespoon of the  Chicken  mixture in the middle. Dip your finger in the  water  and run it along the edges of the wonton wrapper to wet. Take another wonton wrapper and place it on top in a way that forms a star shape (i.e. the top wrapper looks like a diamond instead of a square). Continue with the rest of the mixture.
 To deep-fry, heat 3 to 4 cups of  oil  to between 360 and 375 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Deep-fry the wontons a few at a time, sliding them carefully into the wok so that the  oil  doesn't splatter. Deep-fry until they turn golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve with Sweet and Sour Sauce or the dipping sauce of your choice.
