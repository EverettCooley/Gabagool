This is another large category belonging to the rich Omani cuisine. Among the great variety of dishes you will always find rice as one of the most important ingredients. For instance, if you are willing to prepare basmati rice, you need uncooked rice, salt, butter, or vegetable oil, but when preparing rice pilaf, which tastes delicious if you add baked chicken or fish, you need ingredients like well-rinsed and soaked rice, garlic, onions, olive oil, saffron strands, water, tomatoes, coriander, parsley or cilantro, cardamom, red or black pepper, cinnamon, toasted vermicelli, and chicken broth. As it is already known, rice offers consistency to any kind of food.
