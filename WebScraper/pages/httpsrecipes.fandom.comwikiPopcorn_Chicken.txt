 Description : 
 The crispy alternative to the original popcorn, this white-hot, bite-sized appetizer/side dish is made from real chicken and packed with herbs and spices, as it then maintains a savory taste with the poultry.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 3-4 cups vegetable oil 
 1 egg, lightly beaten 
 1 cup white flour 
 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning 
 1 teaspoon salt, rock or iodized only 
 3 tablespoons black pepper 
 2 teaspoons garlic powder 
 2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice, optional 
 2 boneless chicken breasts 
 Directions : 
 Cut the chicken breasts into small chunks with the chef's knife. 
 Sift the flour and mix up the salt, Cajun seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, and lemon or lime juice (optional).Â  Dip the chicken in the egg then generously coat in the flour mixture. 
 Heat the oil in a frying pan. Drop a few drops of batter into the oil and, if it sizzles and fries, then it is ready. 
 Add chicken to the oil in small batches and turn over to make sure both sides are cooked evenly. 
 Remove and drain on kitchen paper when golden. Leave to drain a moment or two so the chicken is crunchy. 
 Sprinkle salt to taste. Serve warm and plain over white rice or with other appetizers or side dishes.
