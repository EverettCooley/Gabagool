Chicken  in a Pot
 
Serves 6.
 
 1 Large  Chicken , About 5 Lb., Cleaned And Trimmed 
 4 C. Stock or  water 
 1 Large  Onion , Whole And Unpeeled 
 1/2 C. Dried Porcini  Mushrooms , Optional 
 1/2 C. Uncooked  pearl barley

 1/2 Lb. Frozen Diced  carrots 
 4 Tbsp.  butter , More or Less 
 salt  And  pepper 
 Chopped Fresh  parsley  Leaves For Garnish
 
Put  Chicken  in a Large Pot, And Add Enough Stock And/Or  water  to Come About Halfway up Its Sides. Add  Onion  And, if You're Using Them, The  Mushrooms , And Bring to Boil Over High Heat. Partially Cover, And Adjust Heat so Liquid Simmers Gently.
 
After About 30 Minutes Add  Barley  And Continue to Cook. The  Chicken  Will be Done About 30 Minutes Later. (cut Into it to Make Sure; The Juices Will Run Clear, And There Will be Only a Trace of Pink at Leg Joint.) Remove it to a Platter And Keep Warm. Remove  Onion , And Discard, Retaining Liquid.
 
Add  green beans ,  corn  And  carrots  to Pot, With  butter  And Some  salt  And  pepper , And Raise Heat to High. Cook Until Mixture is Thick And Most of The Visible Liquid Gone. (if This Happens Before Vegetables Are Tender, Add Some  water  or Stock And Continue.) Carve  Chicken , And Serve With Vegetable Mixture. Garnish With  parsley .
