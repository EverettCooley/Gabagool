'Banh' means anything to do with flour or dough. 'Lot' means falling or fitting through a hole. So Banh Lot itself means little dough falling through holes. The mixture should have a consistency so that as the dough comes out it will break into little pieces instead of long string.
 Traditionally, Banh Lot has been made with some additives that are harmful for our bodies such as borax etc. this chemical has been banned in Australia. I happen to know this chemical because one of my sisters is working in the medical field but I don't believe that the community knows about the ban. Who is going to check the product? Anyway all fish balls or some cakes may contain borax in it so I normally made those myself.
 There are at least two kinds of Banh Lot
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup of  rice flour 
 Â½ cup of  tapioca flour 
 1 pinch of  salt 
 1 heap tablespoon of  sugar 
 2 cups of water (or 1 cup or water and 1 cup of  coconut milk ). 
 Directions : 
 Mix well then bring it to slow heat and stir until mixture pulls away from sides of pan to form a sticky mixture. 
 Place the mixture in a container or a colander that has round holes (0. 
 5 centimetre) sitting on a cold bucket of water, press the mixture down the holes using a big spoon going left and right until all the mixture has gone through the holes to make little dough's called 'banh lot'. 
 Drain the 'banh lot' and they are ready to be used. 
 Banh lot can be served hot or cold. 
 To serve place 4 tablespoons of banh lot in a small bowl add 2 tablespoons of sugar syrup, a tablespoon of shaved ice and 2 tablespoons of coconut sauce. 
 More sugar or coconut sauce can be added if desired.
