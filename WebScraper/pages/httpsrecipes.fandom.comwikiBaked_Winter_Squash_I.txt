Ingredients : 
 Winter squash 
 apples 
 cranberries 
 water 
 Walnuts  (optional) 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut open  squash  (cut in half or into chunks), scoop out seeds. 
 Lay cut-side down in a baking pan. Peel and core 1 or 2  apples ; slice, and scatter the  apple  slices in with the  squash . 
 Scatter a handful or two of  cranberries  around with the  squash  and  apples . 
 If you like your  squash  a bit moist, add a tablespoon or two of  water  to the bottom of the pan (I don't do this; my husband does). 
 Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake at 400 °F for 1 hour, or until a fork stuck into the hard outside shell meets with no resistance. 
 Scoop the  squash  out of the rind, scoop up a bit of the  apple  and  cranberries  on the side, and enjoy!
