Description : 
 Meatballs with bulgur and a filling of minced meat with pine nuts.
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g  bulgur 
 250 g  veal minced meat 
 250 g  lamb minced meat 
 1 teaspoon  red pepper 
 2 tablespoons  cumin 
 3 tablespoons  parsley , finely chopped 
 2 tablespoons  butter 
 oil  (for frying) 
 2 large  onions , finely chopped 
 2 tablespoons  pine nuts 
 100 g  walnuts , finely chopped 
 2  eggs , beaten 
 rusk  crumbs 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan put the  onions  with the  butter  and a little bit of  salt  and sauté them. 
 Add the  lamb  minced meat and the  pine nuts  and sauté until the minced meat has absorbed all the fluids and is granular. 
 Take the mixture off the heat and add the  parsley , the  walnut  crumbs and the  salt . 
 Spread the  bulgur  in a pan, add the red pepper,  cumin ,  salt  and a cup of  water  and knead well all the ingredients. 
 Add the  veal  minced meat and knead again. 
 Shape this mixture into small, long and narrow meatballs. 
 With your finger press the edge of each meatball so as to open up a hole and stuff it with the mixture of  lamb  minced meat and then close it well. 
 As soon as you have filled all the meatballs, put over the heat a saucepan with 4-5 cups of  water  and some  salt  and as soon as the  water  comes to a boil, add the meatballs and let them boil for 20 minutes. 
 Take them out with a straining spoon and let them cool off. 
 Then dip them one by one into a mixture of  egg  and rusk crumbs and fry them in hot  oil . 
 These meatballs are very spicy and are served as an hors d’oeuvre.
