Ingredients : 
 ½ pound lean  ground turkey 
 ½ cup coarsely chopped  onion 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ½ cup  salsa  or  picante sauce 
 ¼ cup homemade  chicken broth  or canned reduced-sodium chicken broth 
 1 teaspoon  chili powder 
 ½ teaspoon  cumin  seeds, or ¼ teaspoon ground cumin 
 4 x 6-inch diameter flour  tortillas 
 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped  cilantro 
 ¼ cup (1 ounce) shredded reduced-fat  cheddar  or reduced-fat  Monterey jack  /  colby  blend cheese 
 ½ cup shredded  lettuce 
 ¼ cup chopped  tomato 
 1 chopped fresh  jalapeno pepper  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the turkey, onion, and garlic in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until no longer pink. 
 Drain and return to the skillet. 
 Add the salsa, broth, chili powder, and cumin. 
 Simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 While the turkey mixture simmers, broil the tortillas about 4 to 5 inches from the heat source until crisp and golden brown, turning occasionally. 
 Stir the cilantro into the turkey mixture. 
 Top each tortilla with ¼ cup turkey mixture, 1 tablespoon cheese, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and 1 tablespoon chopped tomato. 
 Sprinkle with jalapeno pepper, if desired.
