Description Mom used to speak of her grandmothers Prune Kolaches : 
 This is a traditional Bohemian pastry recipe handed down from my wife's much beloved Bohemian grandmother who took joy in watching her family eat. It seems like it isn't a real family get-together without kolaches and it also seems like there are never enough made. If you don't like  prunes , any fruit filling will work very, very well.
