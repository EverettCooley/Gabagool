The main difference between noodles and pasta (macaroni or spaghetti) is that, in addition to flour and water, noodles contain  eggs  or  egg yolks . Noodles can be cut into flat, thick or thin strips of various lengths. They may also be cut into squares. A wide variety of noodles are available in markets, including those enriched with vitamins and minerals, and colored noodles (red tinted with tomato paste or beet juice and green with spinach). Noodles are sold fresh (these should be refrigerated for no more than 3 days) and dried (best stored in a cool, dry place for no more than 6 months).
