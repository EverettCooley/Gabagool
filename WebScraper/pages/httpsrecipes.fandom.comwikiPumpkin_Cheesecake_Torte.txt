 Ingredients : 
 Crust 
 1 1/3 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 10 double crackers) 
 4 Tbs. soft canola  margarine 
 1 lb.  soft tofu , drained 
 15-oz. can solid-pack  pumpkin 
 4 oz. soy  cream cheese  ( 1/2 cup), at room temperature 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 1 tsp.  vanilla extract 
 3/4 tsp. ground  cinnamon , plus additional for dusting 
 1/2 tsp. ground  nutmeg 
 1/2 tsp. ground  allspice 
 1/4 tsp. ground cloves 
 Directions : 
 Position rack in center of oven; preheat oven to 350 °F. Coat 8 1/2-inch springform pan with  cooking spray .
 
 Make crust: In food processor, pulse graham cracker crumbs and  margarine  until evenly moistened. Firmly press crumb mixture into bottom and about 1/2 inch up sides of prepared pan. Bake until set, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely. Keep oven on for baking cheesecake.
 
 In food processor, puree  tofu  until smooth. Add  pumpkin  and process
 
 until blended. Add  soy cheese ,  Sugar ,  vanilla ,  cinnamon ,  nutmeg ,  allspice  and cloves and process until smooth and well combined. Pour mixture into cooled crust and bake on center rack 45 minutes.
 
 Turn oven off. Let cheesecake cool in oven 1 hour without opening door. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate cheesecake at least 8 hours or overnight. (Don’t worry if cheesecake seems a little soft; it will firm up during chilling.)
 
 To serve, run a long, thin knife around inside edge of pan to loosen cake; remove sides of pan. Lightly dust top of cheesecake with  cinnamon  and serve at room temperature.
