Jamaicans have little need for imported  smoked salmon , as they enjoy their own classy variation from the nearby waters of the Gulf Stream. There's even a world-famous  marlin  tournament held in Port Antonio each year. The marlin that isn't immediately devoured as steaks is carried off to the smoker, where it takes on a milder  salmon  like flavor and texture that holds up well when thinly sliced.
