      Calzone     
 Sandwich-sized calzoni are often sold at Italian lunch counters or by street vendors because they are easy to eat while standing or walking.
 Sweet versions, usually smaller and cookie-sized, are a specialty in the Marche region of Itlay.
 Fried versions typically filled with tomato and mozzarella, are made in Puglia and are called  Panzerotti .
 Related to the  Sicilian   cuddiruni  or  cudduruni  pizza. This is stuffed with onions (or sometimes other vegetables such as potatoes or broccoli), anchovies, olives, cheese, mortadella: the rolled pizza dough is folded in two over the stuffing and the edge is braided, prior to frying.
A  calzone  (Italian "stocking" or "trouser" or "drooping sack" or "hanging fold") is a turnover that originates from Italy. It is made of ingredients similar to  pizza , folded over and shaped like a crescent before being cooked. The typical calzone is stuffed with tomato and mozzarella, and may include other ingredients usually associated with pizza toppings.
 In Italian the word  calzone  has three syllables,  [kalˈtsone] . Pronunciations of the word in English vary greatly, with UK:  /kælˈtsoʊni/  or /kælˈzoʊni/, [4]  and US:  /kælˈzoʊni/ , /kælˈzoʊneɪ/, or /kælˈzoʊn/.
