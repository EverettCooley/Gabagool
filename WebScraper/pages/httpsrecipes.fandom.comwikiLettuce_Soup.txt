Description : 
 This is a soup that my Slovak Grandmother use to make when I was a little girl. She used  lettuce  she would pick fresh out of her garden. I still make this soup every summer and remember her sitting in her kitchen sipping  coffee  with my Mother and Aunt. It brings back such fond memories.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs thick slab  bacon 
 flour 
 milk 
 2  eggs , beaten 
 2 bunches  leaf lettuce 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 In a cast iron skillet (this the best but you can use any type skillet) fry 2 lbs of  bacon  (to render fat, but not crisp the  bacon ). 
 Remove  bacon  from skillet leaving the fat in the pan. 
 Allow the fat to brown (slightly). 
 For every 2 tablespoons of browned fat rendered add 2 tablespoons of  flour . 
 Stirring constantly, brown  flour  in fat to a deep golden brown. 
 Allow to cool slightly so as not to curdle the  milk  when added.
