 Description : 
 coconut  is not abundant in many areas, so  water  becomes the liquid for stews, as in this  Beef  dish from Uganda. In this area, too, the combination of Arabic and Indian influences contributed the  curry  powder to this recipe.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  Beef , cut in 1-inch cubes 
 salt  to taste 
 2  onions , minced 
 2 tablespoons  butter  or  oil 
 4  tomatoes , peeled and diced 
 1 teaspoon  curry  powder 
 Directions : 
 In a stewing pan, add enough  water  to meat to barely cover. Season with  salt , bring to a boil, and simmer until tender, about 1 hour. remove meat and drain, reserving stock. 
 Sauté  onions  in  butter  or  oil  until golden brown. Add  tomatoes  and continue sautéing 5 minutes. Add meat and brown. Stir in  curry  powder; continue cooking until flavors have blended. Add enough of reserved stock to make stew of desired consistency.
