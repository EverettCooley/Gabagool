Description : 
 Cold Noses
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 package  wonton wrappers 
 berries  ( blueberries ,  raspberries  or  blackberries ) 
 sugar 
 sweetened  sour cream  (stir in approximately 1 teaspoon  honey  or  sugar  per ¼ cup  sour cream ) 
 Directions : 
 Use an inverted glass like a cookie cutter to cut the won-ton wrappers into rounds. 
 Or, if you prefer, wrappers can be left square. 
 Place lightly salted  water  on the stove to boil while preparing the dumplings. 
 Use enough  water  so the dumplings can move freely about without crowding, otherwise they will stick together. 
 Place about one teaspoon of  berries  in the center of the won-ton wrapper. 
 Be careful not to use so many  berries  that they are likely to leak out during cooking. 
 Place about one teaspoon of  sugar  on the  berries . 
 Moisten the edges of the wonton wrapper. 
 Fold over the edges sealing well. 
 If you used round wrappers, your dumplings will now be in half circles. 
 If you used square wrappers, you will have triangular shaped dumplings. 
 Repeat until won-ton wrappers or  berries  are used up. 
 Reduce the heat on the boiling  water  to a gentle simmer. 
 Drop the dumplings in the hot  water  one at a time. 
 To prevent the dumplings from sticking together, stir once around the pot with a wooden spoon. 
 Do this only when necessary, as you do not want to break open the won-ton wrapper and have the filling leak out. 
 Simmer gently about 5 minutes. 
 When done, remove dumplings from  water  using a slotted spoon. 
 Drain well. 
 Using small serving bowls; place 2 – 3 dumplings in each bowl. 
 Top the dumplings with a dollop of the sweetened  cream .
