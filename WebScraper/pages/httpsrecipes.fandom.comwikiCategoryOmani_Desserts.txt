 Even sweets are extremely popular among the Omani people, but halwa has always been number one. A traditional caramelized tapioca sweet is sako, a combination of sugar, tapioca, water, saffron, butter, rose of water, ground cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, and chopped nuts. Kanafa is another type of dessert which consists of “string” pastry, butter, cream, nut, cardamom, syrup, lemon juice, sugar, water, cinnamon, and gloves. For a creamy tapioca pudding you need tapioca, powered milk, ground cardamom, sugar, saffron powder, vanilla, and eggs. Actually, there is another American recipe which is loved by the Omanis and this is fruit crisp with apples or pears, raisins, ground cinnamon, sugar, rolled oats, butter or margarine, white flour, nuts or coconut, and vanilla ice cream. Omani desserts also include gamatte nido, sweets made from powdered milk, baked crème caramel and many others.
