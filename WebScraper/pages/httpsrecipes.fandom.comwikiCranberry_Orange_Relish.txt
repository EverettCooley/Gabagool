Description : 
 I make this every year at Thanksgiving. It's quicker and less bitter tasting than traditional cranberry sauce, and is a good alternative to the ubiquitous canned cranberry sauce.
 
 Cook Time : 10 minutes 
 Ingredients : 
 1 package fresh  cranberries 
 1 whole  orange Â (peeled and seeded) 
 1 cup  sugar  (or more to taste) 
 Directions : 
 Blend cranberries and orange together in food processor until smooth. 
 Pour into bowl and stir in 1 cup sugar. 
 Refrigerate and serve.
