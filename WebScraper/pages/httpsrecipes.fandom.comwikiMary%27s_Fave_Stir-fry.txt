 Description : 
 An easy dish that can be made quickly after work, this stir fry has a ton of flavor and most people like these ingredients so it's a crowd pleaser. Plus, I use low-sodium soy and just a bit of honey so it's a pretty healthy, quick dinner.

 3 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 cloves  garlic , diced 
 1.5 to 2 lbs  chicken breast , sliced into strips 
 red  and  green peppers  (1 each) 
 Bermuda onion  (1 medium) 
 soy sauce 
 honey 
 Directions : 
 Heat garlic in olive oil for a minute or so. 
 Stir fry the chicken. 
 Remove chicken from pan, cook veggies. 
 Add chicken back in and season with soy sauce and honey to taste! Yum.
