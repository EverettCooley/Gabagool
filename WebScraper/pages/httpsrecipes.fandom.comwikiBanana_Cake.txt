      Banana Cake     
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  butter  1 stick 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2  eggs 
 3 ripe  bananas  puréed 
 2 cups  flour 
 ½ tsp  nutmeg 
 1 tsp  baking soda 
 ½ cup  cashew  nuts chopped 
 Meringue : 
 4  egg whites 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2 tbsp  light rum 
 Directions : 
 Cream  butter  and  sugar ; beat in  eggs  one at a time. 
 Fold in mashed  bananas  and  flour  sifted with soda and  nutmeg . 
 Add  cashew  nuts. 
 Bake about 50 minutes in lined, greased cake tin. 
 Meringue : 
 Beat egg whites, add sugar and rum gradually and continue beating until mixture holds a peak. 
 Zosha's notes : 
 Skip the "lining", just  butter  and  flour . Generally a cake tin would mean an 8" round cake pan. You could make it in a loaf pan as well.
 The meringue is obviously part of the cake, but it doesn't say what you are supposed to do with it. I suspect that it is one of those things you are supposed to know. So here is my guess. Spread the meringue after the cake has cooked and cooled and bake a little while longer.
