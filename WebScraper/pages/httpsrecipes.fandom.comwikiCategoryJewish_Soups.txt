 Jewish cuisine includes a wide range of soups, best represented by the traditional ajo blanco, balkabagi corbasi and farfel (potato dairy soup). The ajo blanco basically means chilled almond soup with grapes and it includes sherry wine vinegar and peeled and halved grapes for a delicate texture and taste. The balkabagi corbasi or the pumpkin soup is a sweet soup with cinnamon and honey, but also soy yoghurt, all in a chicken stock.
