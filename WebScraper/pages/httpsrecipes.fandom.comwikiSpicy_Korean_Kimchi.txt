       Spicy Korean Kimchi     
 Serve this as a side dish-a garnish that will enhance the flavor of your meal.
 
 Preparation: 72 hours and 20 minutes. 
 This recipe is for 2 pints. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb sized head  Chinese cabbage 
 2 tablespoons  sea salt 
 4 cups cold  water 
 1 tablespoon fresh  garlic , chopped 
 1 tablespoon fresh  ginger , finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon  green onions , finely chopped 
 2 teaspoons dried  chili pepper flakes 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Separate and wash the  cabbage  leaves. 
 Sprinkle them with the 2 tbsp of  salt . 
 Place them in a non corrosive dish (pyrex) and pour in the 4 cups cold  water , cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge over night. 
 The  water  should cover the leaves if not place a heavy object on them to keep them submerged. 
 After sitting overnight pour off the  water  and rinse the leaves well, shake out excess moisture (I used my  lettuce  dryer to remove the extra moisture). 
 Mix the  garlic ,  ginger ,  green onion , chile flakes , sugar  and 1 tbsp  salt , stir together. 
 Pour 1Â½ cups of very hot  water  over the mixed seasoning. 
 Place  cabbage  leaves in a large zip lock bag or in a bowl, pour in the seasoning, mix well so the seasoning is on every leaf. 
 Place in the fridge for two days. 
 Flip the bag every time you open the fridge door. 
 To serve cut the leaves into 2" strips and serve as a side condiment. 
 To store pack the  cabbage  into a jar and store in the fridge it will keep for several days to a week or more.
