 About Worcestershire sauce : 
 Worcestershire sauce (pronounced /ˈwʊstərʃər sɔːs/ WOOS-tər-sher sauce), or Worcester Sauce (/ˈwʊstər sɔːs/ WOOS-tər sauce) is a fermented liquid condiment flavouring used especially with grilled or barbecued meats. It is also used in cocktails and drinks.
 First made at 68 Broad Street, Worcester, England, by two dispensing chemists, John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins, the Lea & Perrins brand was commercialised in 1837 and has been produced in the current Midlands Road factory in Worcester since 16 October 1897. It was purchased by H.J. Heinz Company in 2005 who continue to manufacture and market "The Original Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce", under the name Lea & Perrins, Inc., as well as Worcestershire Sauce under their own name and labelling. Other companies manufacture similar products, often also called Worcester Sauce, and marketed under different brands. Additionally, in recent years recipes have begun appearing for homemade variations of the British version.
