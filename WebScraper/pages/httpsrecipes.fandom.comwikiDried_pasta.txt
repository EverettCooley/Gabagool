 Wikipedia Article  About Dried pasta on Wikipedia 
 Dry pasta (known as "pasta secca" in Italian) generally contains about 10% moisture, which makes it shelf stable for about three years.  Fresh pasta  does not keep as long, it will remain usable for a few days if kept in the fridge, or it can be frozen.
