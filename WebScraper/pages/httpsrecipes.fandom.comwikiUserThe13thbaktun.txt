 About Me : 
 Just another foodie out there, scrounging the Internet and looking in cookbooks for new and interesting recipes. Won't go as far to say I'm an Anthony Bourdain wannabe, but I'm definitely a huge fan of Bourdain and what he does.
 My favorite type of cuisine to cook (and in which I specialize) is Cajun, but I freely make dishes from just about every other ethnicity that I can. Hungarian cuisine intrigues me greatly and why not? Part of my ancestry is Hungarian...why not explore the food of such a great culture?
 I've no aspirations to be a chef, or go to cooking school, despite the fact that cooking and baking are great hobbies of mine. I just like cooking for family and friends - far more rewarding than being a professional chef,Â :).
 Please enjoy the recipes that I post to the Recipes Wiki; I've enjoyed many of them for years and if you've a refined palate, you'll like quite a few of the recipes I've posted.
