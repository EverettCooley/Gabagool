 Wikipedia Article  About Muscovado sugar on Wikipedia 
 Muscovado is a type of unrefined sugar with a strong molasses flavour. It is also known as Barbados or moist sugar. It is very dark brown in color, and slightly coarser and stickier than most brown sugars. Unlike most brown sugars, which are composed of refined white sugar with molasses added, muscovado takes its flavor and color from the sugar cane juice it is made from. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably good shelf life. The unrefined sugar goes well with coffee and other beverages, and was one of the most prominent export commodities of the Philippines in the 1800s.
 Related types of raw sugars include  Jaggery ,  Demerara sugar , and  Turbinado sugar .
 One of the darkest of the raw dark brown sugars that is produced during the third crystallization of the cane syrup, muscovado sugar has a fine-grained texture with natural molasses to provide a strong flavor and consistency similar to refined brown sugar. Available as either a dark or light sugar, the dark variety is somewhat stickier with a heavier flavor than the light. When determining which type to use, select the one that best suits the color desired for the food to which it is added. Muscovado is also referred to as a Barbados sugar, however a Barbados sugar has a finer texture than the muscovado.
