 About Crystallized ginger : 
 Crystallized ginger, also called candied ginger, is made of small pieces of fresh ginger-the rhizome, or underground stem, of a semitropical plant- that are first preserved and then coated with granulated sugar. It is used to lend an intriguing hot-sweetness to baked goods and desserts. Store in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months.
