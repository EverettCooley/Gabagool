Description : 
 Similar to the Kansas-city style barbecue sauce, this red-hot European barbecue sauce is made with tomato purée, honey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, spices, and dry, red wine or sherry and is great for meat, poultry, or seafood, as it also keeps a bold taste with the tomato and alcohol content and has the largest suspicion of mustard or curry and black pepper for flaming-hot zest.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup tomato purée or sauce 
 ½ cup water, cold only 
 3 tbsp. honey 
 1 tsp. salt, rock or iodized only 
 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce 
 2 ½ tsp. mustard or curry powder 
 ½ tsp. black pepper 
 3 cloves garlic, minced  or  (6 tablespoons garlic powder) 
 ¼ cup dry, red wine or sherry 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight. This can be made in a food processor or blender. 
 Pour or spoon contents from the homemade English-style barbecue sauce into a fresh plastic or glass jar or bottle. Reserve this in the freezer or refrigerator. 
 Use as you would with any barbecue sauce, for basting meat, poultry, or seafood.
