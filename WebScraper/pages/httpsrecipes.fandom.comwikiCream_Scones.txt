 Description : 
 A good dose of heavy cream makes these scones nice and flavourful. Serve
them warm from the oven, with a nice fruit or cream cheese spread.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 1/2 cups flour 
 3 1/2 tsp baking powder 
 3 tbs sugar 
 1/2 tsp salt 
 5 tbs butter 
 2 eggs, slightly beaten 
 1/2 cup heavy cream 
 Directions : 
 Combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl. 
 Cut in butter and stir in eggs and cream. 
 Turn out dough onto a floured board and knead briefly. 
 Roll out to 1-inch thick and cut out 2-inch rounds. 
 Place on a baking sheet and bake scones in a preheated 400F oven for about 15 minutes 
 or until tops are brown. Serve warm.
