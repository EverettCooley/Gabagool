Description : 
 A nice  pumpkin  soup.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2½ lbs  pumpkin , cleaned and cut in chunks 
 2 tablespoons  butter  or  margarine 
 1 large  onion , chopped 
 1 large  apple , chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1 tablespoon  curry  powder 
 1 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1 teaspoon  ground coriander 
 ½ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 1 liter  chicken stock  or  vegetable stock 
 lemon juice 
 chopped  parsley  or  coriander , to serve 
 sour cream  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  butter  in the pan you are making the soup in, fry the  onion  and  garlic  for 2 minutes, add the  curry ,  cumin  and  cayenne pepper , fry a few minutes more. 
 Add the  pumpkin  and the  apple , mix, and then add the stock. 
 Bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes. 
 I use a hand-held blender to blend the soup but otherwise let the soup cool and blend in the food processor. 
 Add the  lemon juice  and check the seasoning. 
 Serve with the  parsley  sprinkled over,  sour cream  (or  yoghurt ) and nice bread.
