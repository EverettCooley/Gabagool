 Description : 
 From my Aunt Maggie's collection. She made this for me many times when I was a small child and I still remember the aroma and delightful taste of this recipe. It's at least 60 years old (I'm not but the recipe isâ€¦lol), but I'm not sure of the exact date.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 buttered slices of Texas Toast 
 2/3 cups golden  raisins 
 1  egg  beaten 
 1 cup  milk 
 1 cup white granulated  white sugar 
 1 cup  dark brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut buttered bread into cubes. Mix  raisins  with the bread. 
 In a separate bowl, stir together  milk ,  egg , and  vanilla . 
 Place white and brown sugars in the top of a double boiler. Stir to mix. 
 Place bread and  Raisin  mixture on top of  Sugar . Pour  milk  mixture over bread. Cover. 
 Place pan over boiling  water  (which is in the bottom half of the double boiler). 
 Cook on stove top for approximately 1 hour or until the mixture is set. 
 DO NOT STIR. Turn out of pan onto a dish with sides. 
 The sugars form a caramel syrup over the bread pudding. Best if served warm.
