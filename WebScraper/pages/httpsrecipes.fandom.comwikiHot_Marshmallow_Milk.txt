Ingredients : 
 Milk 
 Marshmallows 
 Toppings of your choice (cinnamon, cocoa, etc) 
 Instructions : 
 Pour the milk into a mug and top with a few marshmallows. I like to use lots of marshmallows. 
 Microwave milk as you would for regular hot milk. At my house, I microwave it for 1 minute 40 seconds at 900 W. The marshmallow should be melting at this point. 
 Lastly, sprinkle with some cinnamon or whatever to your liking. 
 Drink whilst stirring with a spoon.
