 About Instant tapioca : 
 Don't confuse instant tapioca with regular tapioca, which has larger beads, or with the even larger tapioca pearls sold in Asian markets. MinuteÂ® tapioca is a well-known brand. 
 Substitutions: cornstarch (Use half as much. Cornstarch breaks down if it's mixed with acidic ingredients, cooked for a long time, or frozen and thawed) or arrowroot or flour (Use a little more.) 
 Tapioca is gluten-free.
