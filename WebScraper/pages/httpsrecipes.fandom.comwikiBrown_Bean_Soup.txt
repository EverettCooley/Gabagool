Description : 
 A traditional soup, it can be made very basic and varied by additional ingredients. It is very filling and is often eaten here as a main dish with bread. The brown beans we use are also known as  Swedish brown beans . If you cannot get these then the best substitute for this soup would be  pinto beans . I always serve this with dark fried  onions  and crispy  Bacon  cubes. Soaking time not included.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  brown beans , soaked overnight and drained 
 3 liters  water 
 1  bay leaf 
 2 – 3  leeks , washed and sliced in rings 
 1 large  carrot , cubed 
 1 large peeled  potato , cubed 
 Worcestershire sauce 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1  bouillon cube  (optional) 
 ½ cup chopped flat  celery leaves 
 Directions : 
 Put the beans in a pan with the  water  and bay leaf, bring to the boil. 
 Boil rapidly for 10 minutes, then simmer for 1½ hours or until the beans are tender. 
 Then add the  leeks ,  carrot ,  potato , Worcestershire and  salt  and  pepper , simmer for another 30 minutes. 
 Taste the soup or you want to add a stock cube. 
 You can puree the soup at this point, but it is nicest when you just mash the beans and potaoes a bit so it thickens. 
 Add the celery leaves 5 minutes before serving. 
 Other additions/fillings for the soup: left-over cooked  beef  or  pork , tiny meatballs, slices of smoked  sausage , hot sauce,  ketchup  sauce.
