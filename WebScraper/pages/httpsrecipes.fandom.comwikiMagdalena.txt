Thought by some to be Spain's answer to the French  Madeleine , magdalenas are small  sponge cakes  made with  eggs ,  flour  and  olive oil  â€” although many modern versions use  sunflower oil  instead. Although these small cakes have been made for special holidays since the Middle Ages, they are now so popular that they're an everyday pleasure for most Spaniards. Magdalenas have an invitingly tender, moist texture and shiny, golden brown tops. They come in three basic shapes-the classic, high-domed round, a flat-topped round and an oblong shape.
