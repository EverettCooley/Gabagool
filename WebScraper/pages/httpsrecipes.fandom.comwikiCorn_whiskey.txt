 About Corn whiskey : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Corn whiskey on Wikipedia 
 Corn whiskey is an American whiskey made from a mash made up of at least 80 percent corn (maize). The whiskey is distilled to not more than 80 percent alcohol by volume, and aged in used or untreated oak barrels for a short time, to pick up color from the natural tannins, and reduce the harshness.
 Corn whiskey is distinguished from bourbon since the latter is made from no more than 79% corn.
 Corn whiskey is also frequently called "Corn liquor."
