Description : 
 This recipe comes from a cake decorating class I took a while back. If you have trouble finding some of the ingredients, try the baking aisle of an arts-and-crafts store, such as Hobby Lobby.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  Crisco 
 8 cups sifted  powdered sugar 
 2 tablespoons  all-purpose flour 
 1 tablespoon  meringue powder 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ cup of liquid:
 1 teaspoon clear  vanilla 
 ½ teaspoon clear butter flavor 
 ½ teaspoon  almond extract 
 rest of ½ cup: water 
 Directions : 
 In large mixing bowl, add Crisco, sifted powdered sugar, flour, meringue powder, and salt. 
 In measuring cup, add clear vanilla, butter flavor, and almond extract. 
 Fill up with water to ½ cup line. 
 Be sure to only use ½ cup of liquid total, or the icing will become too soft to work with if more is added. 
 Add liquid mixture to ingredients in bowl. 
 Mix on medium speed until icing is completely mixed and smoothed. 
 Notes : 
 8 cups are equal to a 2 lb bag of powdered sugar. Also, you may substitute almond extract for lemon, orange, etc.
