 About Ilama : 
 The ilama fruit is either cone-shaped, heart-shaped, or ovular. Resembling the  cherimoya , it is about 6 inches (15 cm) long and may weigh as much as two pounds (900 g). Generally, the ilama is dotted with more or less pronounced, triangular spikes that jut out of the fruit, though some fruits on the same tree may vary from rough to fairly smooth.
 There are two types of ilama, green and pink. The green type has a flesh that is white and sweet, while in the pink type, the flesh is a rose color and has a tart taste.
 The rind, or skin of the ilama varies from a pale-green color to a deep-pink or purplish color. The ilama is coated with a thick mat of velvety, gray-white bloom. It is about ¼ inch thick (6 mm), leathery, fairly soft, and granular.
 The center of both ilamas are somewhat fibrous but smooth and custardy near the rind. The flesh varies from being dry to being fairly juicy, and contains 25 to 80 hard, smooth, brown, cylindrical seeds, about ¾ inch (2 cm)long, and ⅜ inch (1 cm) wide. Each seed is enclosed in a close-fitting membrane that, when split, slides right off of the seed.
