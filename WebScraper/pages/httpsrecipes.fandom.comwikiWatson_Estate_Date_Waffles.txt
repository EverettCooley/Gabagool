 Description : 
 Purchased from the Watson Estate in McKinney, Texas in 1991.
Dated 1931.
Notation on card said this was served every Sunday (with variations) for over 30 years in Grandpa Jack’s house.
I have made these recipes with all variations (to follow) and there is not a bad one in the bunch.
My favorite my far is the  Bacon  Waffles.
Yummy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  flour 
 4 teaspoons  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2  eggs 
 1-1/4 cups  milk 
 1/3 cup melted  butter 
 1 cup chopped  dates  dredged in 2 tablespoons  flour 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Sift and measure  flour . 
 Add the remaining dry ingredients and sift again. 
 Beat the  egg   yolks  and them to the  milk . 
 Stir the liquid ingredients into the dry ones. 
 Add melted  butter . 
 Beat  egg  whites until stiff. 
 Fold  egg  whites and  dates  into the batter just before baking. 
 Bake in preheated waffle iron for 3 minutes. 
 Make sure iron is nice and hot. 
 Increase  milk  if batter is too thick.
