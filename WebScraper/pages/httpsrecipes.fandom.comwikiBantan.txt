 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Meat ( Beef  or mutton) 
 salt 
 Onion 
 Dough
 
 Premium  wheat flour 
 A pinch of  salt 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Cut the meat into thin small slices, put in cold  water , add  salt  and boil. Usually, Mongolians do not use lean meat because it does not produce a good bouillon. Therefore, leave the fat on and slice it together with meat. While the bouillon is being cooked, prepare the dough.
 Dissolve a pinch of  salt  in cold  water , mix in  flour  and blend with your fingers into small dough crumbs. Put the crumbs into the boiling bouillon and boil for 4â€“5 minutes until the soup becomes thick and creamy. You can add thinly sliced  Onion .
