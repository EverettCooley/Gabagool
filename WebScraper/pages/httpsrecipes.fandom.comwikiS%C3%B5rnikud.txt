Description : 
 alias curd cheese patties
 Milk curd cheese (kohupiim) is very popular in Estonia in various forms. You can buy it plain, or seasoned with  vanilla  or studded with  Raisins . 
 But  milk  curd can also be used in savoury dishes, and one popular dish is called 's√µrnikud'. Basically these are curd  cheese  patties that have been dipped into  flour  or breadcrumbs and fried gently in  butter  and  oil . The dish is also known in Russia, the Ukraine etc, so it's not 'native' to the Estonian kitchen. But there are almost similar recipes in older Estonian cookbooks.

 250 grams  milk curd cheese 
 50-100 gm  plain flour
