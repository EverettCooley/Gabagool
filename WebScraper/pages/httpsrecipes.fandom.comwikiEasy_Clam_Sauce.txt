 Description : 
 I understand that it is not chic to use grated Parmesan or  Romano  cheese with a seafood sauce, but we love  Romano  on this. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 6½ oz can minced or diced  clams   [1] 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 clove  garlic  minced 
 1 tbsp  oregano  or  basil  or a mixture 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 few grinds of  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Drain juice into small saucepan, and set clams aside. 
 Add  garlic  and seasonings to  clam juice , bring to a simmer, and let cook while the  pasta  cooks. 
 Drain  pasta  and return to pot in which it was cooked. 
 Remove juices from heat, add clams, and pour over cooked  pasta . 
 Toss well and let stand a few minutes so juices can permeate the  pasta  well before you serve it. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   these canned clams must not be cooked — they turn into rocks if you do.
