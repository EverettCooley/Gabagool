When I found the recipe, it was called Indonesian  Chicken , and, not being Indonesian or knowing anyone from Indonesia, I can neither confirm nor deny that this is, indeed, Indonesian  Chicken . It is, however, definitely a recipe for  Chicken , and a mighty tasty one at that. The  Peanut  sauce is also useful to put on things that you don't want to serve naked, such as noodles,  rice , or steamed veggies.
