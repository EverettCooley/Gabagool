 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lb  whole wheat flour 
 2 lb white  flour 
 2 tsp  salt 
 4 oz  shortening 
 1 oz  yeast 
 2 tsp  Sugar 
 Warm  water 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve the  Sugar  in a little warm  water  then sprinkle  yeast  on top and allow to rise. 
 Sift the  flour  and  salt , and add about ¼ of the total amount of  flour  to the  yeast  mixture. Cover and leave in a warm place to set the sponge (i.e. until the mixture is bubbly) -- about 1 hour. 
 If  shortening  is used, rub it into the remainder of the  flour  using fingertips or a fork until the mixture is like breadcrumbs. 
 Add this  flour  to  yeast  mixture and knead well until a smooth elastic dough is formed. Add some more warm  water  if necessary, as a hard dry dough does not rise well. 
 Put the dough in a greased or floured bowl, cover and leave to rise to twice its size. 
 Knead lightly to avoid bursting any bubbles, and without using extra  flour  if necessary. Mould or shape into loaves. 
 Cover and prove. 
 Bake in a hot oven until thoroughly cooked.
