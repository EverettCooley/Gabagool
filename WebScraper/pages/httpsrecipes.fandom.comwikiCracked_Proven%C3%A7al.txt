      Cracked Provençal     
 About Cracked Provençal : 
 An olive, traditionally from France, that has been cured in light brine, and marinated in herbes de Provence, which are selected herbs from Provence, France. The herbs provide a pleasant aroma and a slightly salty flavor to the fruit. The olive is often cracked or slit to allow the marinade to penetrate faster into the meat, resulting in an olive referred to as the cracked Provençal.
