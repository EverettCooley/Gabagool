Description : 
 Serves 4 – 6
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium  cauliflower , cored and broken into florettes 
 ¼ head  red cabbage , cored and shredded 
 6 medium  carrots , diced 
 2 medium  yellow squash , cut into ½" cubes 
 2 cups fresh  spinach , shredded 
 4 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil 
 3 cloves fresh  garlic , minced 
 6 slices whole grain  bread 
 3 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil  + 1 tsp  sea salt  and freshly ground  black pepper , for tossing veggies in. 
 Directions : 
 Steam all vegetables except  spinach  for 10 minutes, or until tender but not mushy. 
 Add  spinach  for the last minute, just to wilt it. 
 In a heavy skillet, heat the 4 tbsp  olive oil . 
 Add the  garlic  and sauté briefly. 
 In your food processor or blender, process the bread crumbs to a corn-meal consistency. 
 Add to the  garlic  and  olive oil  and toss until all  oil  is absorbed into the bread. 
 Toss the steamed veggies with the 1 tbsp  olive oil  and  salt  and  pepper , and then toss with ½ of the crumb mixture. 
 Spread this in a shallow oven-safe pan. 
 Top with the remaining crumb mixture and drizzle with the 2 remaining tbsp of  olive oil . 
 Bake in the hot oven for 5 – 10 minutes, until topping is browned. 
 Keep your eye on it to keep it from burning, though!
