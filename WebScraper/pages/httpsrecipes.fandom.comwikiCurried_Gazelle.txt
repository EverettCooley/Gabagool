 Description : 
 This land-locked Central African country once thrived on its copper reserves, which are now dwindling. Farming methods are primitive, using bush-fallow cultivation methods, but the potential of agricultural expansion is promising. Peasant farmers grow the bulk of local foodstuffs but there is little surplus for sale so that currently a great deal of food is imported. In the bush the hunter can rely on a more substantial meal. 
 Zambia is renowned for its prolific wild life, with large game parks teeming with classic African animals such as the elephant, lion, leopard, giraffe, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, zebra, antelope and many more.
