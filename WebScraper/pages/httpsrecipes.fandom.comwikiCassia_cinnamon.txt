 Cassia bark interchangeable with cinnamon bark, its flavour is sweeter and not as spicy, it's thicker and texture is not as smooth as cinnamon.
 The Asians use the cinnamon flavoured brown bark of the cassia tree. It is found in Asian groceries and is thinner than the cinnamon stick usually found in supermarkets, but either one may be used. 
 Cassia (Cinnamomum aromaticum, synonym C. cassia) is an evergreen tree native to southern China and mainland southeast Asia west to Myanmar. Like its close relative, Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, also known as "true cinnamon" or "Ceylon cinnamon"), it is used primarily for its aromatic bark, which is used as a spice.
 The Cassia tree grows to 10 â€“ 15 m tall, with greyish bark, and hard elongated leaves 10-15 cm long, that have a decidedly reddish colour when young.
