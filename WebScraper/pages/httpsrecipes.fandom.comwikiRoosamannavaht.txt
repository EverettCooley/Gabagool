 4 cups  cranberry juice  (juice rather than cocktail) 
 2 strips of  lemon  zest 
 2/3 cup  farina  ( cream  of  Wheat ) 
 1/2 cup  Sugar 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 1. In a sauce pan add the  Sugar  and  lemon  zest to the juice, bring to a boil.
 2. Sprinkle in the  farina  and mix briskly.
 3. Simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 4. Pour  farina  mixture into a large bowl and whisk until light (or use an electric mix-master with a whisk attachment).
 5. Add the  vanilla  when the pudding is almost whipped.
 6. Chill for 1/2 hour or longer before serving.
 Serving:
 Serve with  milk . When done, it should be fluffy and light and pink.
 Very good! Blood sausages go good!
