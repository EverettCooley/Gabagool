 Description : 
 Indonesian Salad Recipe - Serves 6 
 
 Ingredients : 
 Salad : 
 3 hard boiled  eggs , peeled and sliced 
 ¾ cup  cabbage , shredded 
 ¾ cup  green beans , sliced 
 ¾ cup  carrots , sliced 
 ¾ cup  cauliflower , chopped 
 ½ cup  mung bean sprouts 
 ⅓ cup  snow peas 
 ½  cucumber , sliced 
 2  red potatoes , cut into wedges 
 Peanut dressing : 
 ¾ to 1 cup  coconut milk  (depending on whether you want a thicker or thinner sauce) 
 ½ cup chunky  peanut butter 
 1 teaspoon  red curry  paste or  chile  paste (or  Tabasco sauce ) 
 1 tablespoon  brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon  lime juice 
 2 teaspoons  fish sauce  (or substitute 1 tablespoon  soy sauce ) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wash all the vegetables. 
 Ideally, with the exception of the  eggs  and  cucumber , all of the salad ingredients should be blanched or boiled in a large pot of boiling  water . However, if you are pressed for time you can serve them raw with the exception of the  potato , which has to be boiled. 
 To blanch: plunge the vegetable briefly in the boiling  water , then plunge into cold  water . This leaves the vegetables nicely crisp and neither too firm or limp. Drain all the vegetables. 
 Arrange the vegetables on a serving platter, starting on the outside of the platter and work inwards, arranging the vegetables in a colorful pattern. 
 Top with the chopped  eggs . 
 Peanut dressing : 
 In a small saucepan, bring the  coconut milk  to a boil. 
 Stir in the remaining ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes, until the  peanut butter  has melted and the mixture is thickened.
