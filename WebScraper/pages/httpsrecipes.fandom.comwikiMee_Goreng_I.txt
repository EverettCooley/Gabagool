      Mee Goreng     
 Description : 
 This recipe is from Yotam Ottolenghi's vegetarian cookbook "Plenty". It was published in  guardian.co.uk 
 
 Serves two. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  groundnut oil 
 ½  onion , diced 
 220 g  firm tofu , cut into 1cm strips 
 100 g  french beans , trimmed and cut in half at an angle 
 100 g choi sum (or  pak choi ), cut into chunks (both leaves and stalks) 
 300 g fresh  egg noodles 
 1½ tsp  ground coriander 
 1 tsp ground  cumin 
 2 tsp  sambal oelek  (or other savoury chilli paste), plus extra to serve 
 2 tsp  thick soy sauce 
 2 tsp  light soy sauce 
 1 tbsp water 
 50 g  bean sprouts 
 1 handful shredded  iceberg lettuce 
 1 tbsp crisp-fried  shallots  (from south-east Asian food shops; or use  dried onion flakes ) 
 lemon  wedges, to serve 
 Directions : 
 Set a wok or a large pan over a high heat. 
 Once hot, add the oil and then the onion, and cook for about a minute, to soften a bit. 
 Add the tofu and french beans, and cook for two to three minutes, so the tofu takes on a bit of colour. 
 Stir gently as you cook, trying not to break up the tofu. 
 Next, add the choi sum. 
 When it wilts, add the noodles and carefully spread them in the wok using tongs or large chopsticks. 
 You want the noodles to get a lot of heat, almost to fry. 
 Mixing gently, cook the noodles for about two minutes. 
 Now add the spices, sambal oelek, soy sauces, water and beansprouts, and toss carefully. 
 Cook for about a minute, or until the noodles are semi-soft. 
 When done, top with lettuce, transfer to two serving bowls and sprinkle with some crisp shallots. 
 Serve at once, with lemon wedges and a small bowl of extra sambal oelek on the side.
