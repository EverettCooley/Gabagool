 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2	cup	Frozen  corn  Kernels Or Fresh, Canned Or Thawed 
 3	lrg	 egg whites 
 1/3	cup	 tofu  Soft Or Firm lite 
 1/4	cup	 all-purpose flour  Unbleached 
 1	tbl	chopped  parsley 
 1/2	tsp	 baking powder 
 1/2	tsp	 salt 
 1/4	tsp	 black pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Set aside 1/2 cup  corn  kernels. In a food processor or blender, blend remaining 1 cup  corn  with 1  egg white ,  tofu ,  flour ,  parsley , baking power,  salt  and  pepper  until smooth, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the container. (This mixture was too thick for my blender, so I added a couple of tablespoons of  rice milk  until it began to move.) 
 Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in reserved whole  corn . 
 In another bowl, beat the remaining 2  egg whites  to soft, moist peaks that droop slightly when the beater is lifted (just a couple of minutes). Scoop the  egg whites  onto the  corn  batter and fold them in gently with a rubber spatula. 
 Preheat oven to low. Spray a nonstick skillet lightly with a nonstick spray and place over moderate heat. When the skillet is hot enough to make the batter sizzle, make pancakes, using 1/4 cup batter per cake. 
 Cook until browned on the bottom, 2â€“3 minutes, then turn and cook until cakes are golden brown on the other side, about 2 more minutes. 
 Transfer to a platter and keep warm in oven. Continue until all batter is used. 
 Serving size: 3 three-inch pancakes
