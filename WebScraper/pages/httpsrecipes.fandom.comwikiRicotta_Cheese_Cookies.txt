       Ricotta Cheese Cookies     
 Simply the best!
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  sugar 
 1 cup  margarine   or   butter , softened 
 1 (15 ounces) container  ricotta cheese 
 2 teaspoons  vanilla extract 
 2 large  eggs 
 4 cups  all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 Icing : 
 1½ cups  confectioners' sugar 
 3 tablespoons  milk 
 colored sprinkles (red and green) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat  sugar  and  margarine  or  butter  until blended. 
 Increase speed to high; beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
 At medium speed, beat in ricotta,  vanilla , and  eggs  until well combined. 
 Reduce speed to low. 
 Add  flour ,  baking powder , and  salt ; beat until dough forms. 
 Drop dough by level tablespoons, about 2 inches apart,onto ungreased large cookie sheet. 
 Bake about 15 minutes or until cookies are very lightly golden (cookies will be soft). 
 With pancake turner, remove cookies to wire rack to cool. 
 Repeat with remaining dough. 
 When cookies are cool, prepare icing: in small bowl, stir  confectioners' sugar  and  milk  until smooth. 
 With small metal spatula or knife, spread icing on cookies; sprinkle with red or green  sugar  crystals. 
 Set cookies aside to allow icing to dry completely, about 1 hour.
