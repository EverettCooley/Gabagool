Description : 
 Pancakes
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 oz  flour 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 2  eggs 
 ½ pint  milk 
 ¼ stick  butter  (melted) 
 Directions : 
 Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. 
 With your hand or a spoon, make a hole (or a well) in the center. 
 Crack the eggs and slowly mix into the flour. 
 As the mix thickens, gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. 
 When the batter is free of lumps, add the butter and mix again. 
 Drop large spoonfuls of the batter onto a hot griddle or frying pan that has been well-greased. 
 Cook the ffroes until they are browned, and then flip and cook the other side. 
 When ffroes are cooked, lavish with a lot of salty butter.
