Description : 
 It's an easy to cook recipe of soup - with a warm and tantalizing taste. It is described as the best recipe of an Estonian woman who had moved all over Europe during World War II. Flecked with splashes of  heavy cream  and touched up with a few  scallion  slices, it's a pretty soup - with a hot earthy sweetness overlaid with the tart of  lemon  and the spice of  curry . Absolutely outstanding as a first course to spicy barbequed  chicken  or  pork .
