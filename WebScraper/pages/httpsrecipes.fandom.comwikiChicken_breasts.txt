      Chicken Breasts     
 A type of domestic fowl raised for its flesh, eggs, and feathers. Chickens are slaughtered at different ages to be processed for different purposes and classified according to their use such as  broilers, fryers ,  roasters , and stewers. Broilers and fryers are chickens that weigh 3 to 4 pounds, are 7 to 12 weeks old and are best used for broiling or fry cooking. As the chicken becomes 10 to 12 weeks old, weighs 2 to 5 pounds and gains more fat, they are referred to as roasters since they are most suitable for roasting or cooking on rotisserie grills. Stewing chickens, which weigh up to 7 pounds and are over 10 months old, are typically best for stewing or processing into canned chicken products.
