Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds very lean skirt or bottom-round  steak , cut ¼-inch thick and trimmed of visible fat 
 1  lime 
 4 large  garlic  cloves, pressed through a  garlic  press 
 1 to 2 tsp pequin quebrado or crushed red pepper flakes 
 2 tsp vegetable  oil 
 ¼ cup  brandy 
 4 to 6 (12-inch)  flour  tortillas 
 4 to 6 romaine  lettuce  leaves, cut crosswise into 1-inch strips 
 salsa, chopped  onions , chopped  tomatoes , chopped fresh  cilantro , sour  cream ,and guacamole, for serving with the fajitas, if desired 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  steak  into 4 to 6 equal-size rectangles. 
 Pound the  steak  pieces to flatten them as thin as possible. 
 Cut the  lime  in half and squeeze the juice over both sides of each piece of  steak . 
 Stack the steaks on a plate and let stand for about 30 minutes. 
 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees f. 
 Place a large, well-seasoned, cash-iron skillet over high heat until very hot (it should smoke). 
 At the same time, stack the tortillas, wrap in foil, and place in the oven along with 4 to 6 dinner plates. 
 Add the  oil  to the skillet and quickly sear the meat on both sides. 
 Add the  brandy  to the hot skillet. 
 Flame the meat by touching the  brandy  with a lighted match and let the flames burn down. (keep a large piece of foil or a skillet lid nearby in case the flames rise too high. Just cover them until they subside.) 
 Top the warm tortillas with  lettuce  and pieces of  steak . 
 Garnish with salsa,  onions ,  tomatoes ,  cilantro , sour  cream , and guacamole, if desired. 
 To serve,roll each tortilla around the mixture.
