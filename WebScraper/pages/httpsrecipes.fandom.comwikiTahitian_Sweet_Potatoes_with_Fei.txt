Description : 
 Spicy and creamy without being overly sweet. I used 2 tbsp  curry  paste and I think 4 Thai chiles and it was moderately spicy. That might be too hot for some, so cut back if you don't want it to be hot. I served this with "Thai Marinated Pork with Dipping Sauce- recipe 81667" and "Poat Dot - Cambodian Grilled  corn  recipe 38475" and it made a wonderful dinner. Hope you enjoy!
