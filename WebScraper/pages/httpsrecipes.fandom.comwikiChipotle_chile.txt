 About Chipotle pepper : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Chipotle pepper on Wikipedia 
 Chipotles are smoke-dried chile peppers, usually  moritas , but sometimes  jalapeños , used for cooking Mexican- and Mexican-inspired cuisine.The chiles were originally smoke-dried because thick-skinned chiles do not air-dry well. Today, these peppers are typically smoked in for a period of several days followed by a later drying period. When dry, they are 2–3 inches long and 1 inch wide with a tan, wrinkled skin. Chipotles can be purchased in dried form, or canned and preserved in adobo sauce. Ten pounds of fresh chiles will yield approximately one pound of dried chipotle peppers when the process is complete.
 Chipotles are a key ingredient that impart a relatively mild but earthy spiciness to many dishes in Mexican cuisine. The chiles are used to make various salsas, which are used to season a wide variety of dishes.
