Soft Spice Bars
 These bars have the old-fashioned taste of gingersnaps, but they're
chewy.
 3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
1/4 cup molasses
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
 In a mixing bowl, combine butter, 1 cup of sugar and molasses. Beat
in egg until smooth. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves,
ginger and salt; stir into the molasses mixture. Spread into a
greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining
sugar. Bake at 375 for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Do not
overbake. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
 Yield: 2-1/2 dozen
