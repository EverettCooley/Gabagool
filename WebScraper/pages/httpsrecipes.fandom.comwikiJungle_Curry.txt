 Description : 
 This is a nicely spiced vegan  curry  that one can easily add  bean curd  or slices of meat or seafood to if they wished. They call this jungle  curry  because it has no  coconut milk , and no  coconuts  grow in the jungles of northern Thailand. Not every  curry  needs  coconut milk , and this is even great for those on a heart-healthy diet.
