 Ingredients : 
 8-12 fresh red  paprika  (mild or medium-hot, to taste) 
 4 medium-size  Eggplants 
 1/2 to 3/4 cup  olive oil 
 1 large  Onion , minced 
 3 large  garlic  cloves, chopped 
 1 to 2 tablespoons  lemon juice  (or 1 tablespoon  red wine vinegar ) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Chopped fresh  parsley  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Roast the  paprika  and  Eggplants  over charcoal or a gas flame, or bake them in a preheated 475 F oven, until the skin is blistered and darkened. Place the roasted vegetables in a paper bag and let them steam in their own heat for 10 minutes. Peel off and discard the burnt skin along with the steams and seeds. Mash the  peppers  and  Eggplant  pulp together to form a slightly chunky mass. You can do this with a fork or in a food processor. 
 Heat 3 tablespoons of  oil  in a large skillet and saute the  Onion  until very soft. Add  garlic  and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pepper- Eggplant  pulp, mixing well. Slowly drizzle the remaining  oil  into the mixture, stirring constantly to incorporate all of the  oil . Add  lemon juice  or  vinegar , and  salt  and  pepper , to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with  parsley . 
 Serve as an appetizer to spread on thick slices of country-style white bread or flat pita bread with chunks of  feta   Cheese , or use as a side dish to accompany grilled or roasted meats.
