       Chanterelle     
 Cantharellus is a genus with many delicious and popular edible mushrooms. It is a mycorrhizal edible fungus, meaning it forms symbiotic associations with plants, making it very challenging to cultivate. Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption; lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern, can make a person very ill. Still, the yellow chanterelle is one of the most recognized edible mushrooms and can be found in Asia, Europe, North America and Australia.
 A funnel shaped mushroom that is tapered at the base. The cap of the mushroom measures from one to six inches across, has a depressed center, and a curly edge. When fresh, it has a bright yellow color, which fades to a paler yellow after it is harvested and ages. A pfifferling mushroom has a mild flavor and a subtle scent of apricots. The pfifferling mushroom grows in many areas of North America, but it is most numerous on the West Coast. A large quantity is exported to Europe where it is very popular. A fresh pfifferling will keep in the refrigerator about one week. It can be wrapped in paper towels or placed in a paper bag, but should not be stored in plastic. A dried pfifferlings will last much longer than fresh, but is not as flavorful.
