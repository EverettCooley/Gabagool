 Description : 
 Puff-puff is most often eaten as a plain bread but many variations are possible, especially when it is made for a dessert. You can experiment with various condiments, such as  allspice ,  nutmeg ,  cinnamon , etc.
 
 Makes 40-60 balls. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups (or about ½ liter)  flour 
 2 cups (or about ½ liter)  water 
 ½ cup (or about an eighth of a liter)  Sugar 
 2 teaspoons  yeast 
 Some  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  flour ,  Sugar ,  water , and  yeast  together until the batter is smooth. 
 Wait until the dough has risen. About 2½ hours or so should do. (I've heard that if you use quick-rising  yeast , you don't have to wait, but I have not tried it yet.) 
 Put  vegetable oil  into a pot, until it is at least 2 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter balls), and place on low heat. 
 Test to make sure the  oil  is hot enough by putting a 'drop' of batter into the  oil . If it is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom of the pot rather than rising to the top. 
 When the  oil  is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter, and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the  oil , sort of in the shape of a ball. 
 Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown. 
 Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown. 
 Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the  oil . I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess  oil . 
 If desired, you can roll the finished product in  table sugar  or  powdered sugar  to make it sweeter.
