Description : 
 Chimichurri Chicken Strips Lemony, garlicky and lots of parsley! This is a delicious marinade that is typically used on beef, but its flavors make it outstanding on chicken or seafood. Grilling really brings out the true flavor, but a quick turn in a skillet on the stovetop works, too! Prep time includes marinating. 
 
 2 – 3 servings 
 4 hours 30 minutes (4 hrs 15 mins prep) 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ lbs boneless skinless  chicken breasts , cut in strips 
 1 cup minced  parsley  (about ½ "bunch") 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 ⅓ cup  olive oil 
 ¼ cup  red wine vinegar 
 2 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon coarse grind  black pepper 
 ½ teaspoon dried  oregano  or 1 teaspoon fresh  oregano 
 ¼ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a plastic zipper bag. 
 Marinate chicken strips for at least 4 hours. 
 Remove chicken from marinade; discard remaining marinade. 
 Chicken is best if grilled (perfect threaded on a skewer), but can be pan-fried until very brown for about 5 minutes per "side" or until thoroughly cooked.
