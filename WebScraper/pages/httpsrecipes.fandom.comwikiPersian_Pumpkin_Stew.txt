 Cook covered at a simmer for about 1½ to two hours. 
 meat should be tender and nearly falling apart stage. 
 You may need to add  water  during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the stated amount. You don't want a watery stew. 
 In the meantime, seed the  pumpkin  and slice into 2x2 inch pieces and peel. 
 Brown on both sides in  corn oil . 
 The  pumpkin  should become brown in some places and somewhat flexible but not totally cooked. 
 Add to meat and cook covered an additional 20-30 minutes until tender but not falling apart. 
 A fork should go into the  pumpkin  easily but not break it up. 
 Add the  prunes  the last 5 minutes of cooking. 
 They shouldn't really cook too much but should get warm. 
 Serve over hot  basmati rice .
