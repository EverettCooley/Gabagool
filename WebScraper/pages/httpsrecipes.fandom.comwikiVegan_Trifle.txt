Ingredients : 
 1  Lemon Loaf 
 raspberry  all-fruit spread 
 ½ cup  marsala  wine 
 2½ cups  vanilla  custard (I make it from Bird's custard, that powder stuff that comes out of the red, blue and yellow can); or  vanilla  pudding 
 3 cups Dad's brand  oatmeal  cookies, smashed into crumbs 
 3 cups frozen  blueberries 
 1 tub  Tofutti's "Better Than Cream Cheese" 
 ½ pound smooth, medium- firm tofu 
 ½ cup  brown rice syrup 
 2 tsp  vanilla extract 
 dash of  salt 
 1 cup lightly toasted,  sliced almonds 
 Directions : 
 Have all ingredients ready and cooled prior to assembling. 
 Assemble at least a few hour ahead of serving to give the cake time to soak up the  booze . 
 Cut the  lemon  loaf into 2" thick slices and slather each piece generously with the  raspberry  spread. 
 Layer into the bottom of a glass dish. 
 Drizzle with the  marsala . 
 Layer with the chilled custard, then the crushed  oatmeal  cookies, then the frozen  blueberries . 
 In mixing bowl, whip the "better than  cream cheese " with the  tofu ,  brown rice syrup ,  vanilla  and  salt , until smooth. 
 Slather this over the  blueberries . 
 Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill for several hours. 
 Just before serving, sprinkle with the lightly toasted  almonds .
