 Wikipedia Article  About Sugar cane on Wikipedia 
 Sugarcane or Sugar cane (Saccharum) is a genus of between 6 and 37 species (depending on taxonomic interpretation) of tall grasses (family Poaceae, tribe Andropogoneae), native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Old World. They have stout, jointed fibrous stalks 2 m â€“ 6 m tall and sap rich in sugar. All the species interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.
