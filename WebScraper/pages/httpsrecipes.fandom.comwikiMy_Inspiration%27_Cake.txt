My Inspiration' Cake
 1 cup chopped pecans
2 1/4 cups Pillsbury BEST(R) All Purpose or Unbleached
Flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup shortening
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 egg whites
2 ounces semisweet chocolate, grated
1/2 cup sugar
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
 Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two
9-inch round cake pans. Sprinkle pecans evenly in
bottom of greased and floured pans.
Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. 
 In large bowl, combine all remaining cake ingredients
except egg whites and chocolate; beat 1 1/2 minutes at
medium speed. Add egg whites; beat 1 1/2 minutes.
Carefully spoon 1/4 of batter into each pecan-lined
pan. Sprinkle with grated chocolate. Spoon remaining 
batter over grated chocolate; spread carefully.
 Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 40 minutes or until
cake is golden brown and top springs back when touched
lightly in center. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans.
Cool 1 hour or until completely cooled.
Meanwhile, in small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar,
unsweetened chocolate and 1/4 cup water; cook over low
heat until melted, stirring constantly until smooth.
Remove from heat; cool.
 In small bowl, combine 1/2 cup shortening and 1
teaspoon vanilla. 
Gradually beat in 2 cups of the powdered sugar until
well blended. Reserve 1/3 cup white frosting. To
remaining frosting, add cooled chocolate, remaining
1/4 cup powdered sugar and enough water for desired
spreading consistency.
 To assemble cake, place 1 layer, pecan side up, on
serving plate. Spread with about 1/2 cup chocolate
frosting. Top with second layer, pecan side up. Frost
sides and 1/2 inch around top edge of cake with
remaining chocolate frosting. If necessary, thin
reserved white frosting with enough water for desired
piping consistency; pipe around edge of nuts on top of
cake.
