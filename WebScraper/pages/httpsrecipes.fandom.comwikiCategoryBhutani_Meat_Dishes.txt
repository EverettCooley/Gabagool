 In Bhutan it is forbidden to sacrifice animals and this is because the country is a Buddhist one. Nonetheless, Bhutani people cook very good meat dishes like: pork fing with chili peppers, noodles, onions, tomatoes, butter, pork shoulder cubes, black pepper, salt, and water; phaksha pa with onions, fresh ginger, white radishes, butter, chili powder, boneless pork shoulder, salt, water, bok choy, dried pork, and green chili peppers; tshoem or beef and mushroom, with curry, fresh ginger, garlic, boneless beef chuck, butter, salt, water, fresh green chili peppers, fresh oyster mushrooms, and ground black pepper; kewa phagsha or spicy pork with potatoes, and jasha maroo or minced chicken.
