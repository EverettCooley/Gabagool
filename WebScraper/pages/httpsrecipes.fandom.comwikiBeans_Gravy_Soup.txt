Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  beans 
 salt  to taste 
 1 gin bottle full (½ – 1 cup) of  palm oil 
 hot pepper  to taste 
 1 large  onion 
 2  chicken bouillon  cubes 
 1 small can  tomato paste 
 1 pound  meat  if desired 
 Directions : 
 Soak a cup and a half of beans overnight. 
 What ever kind of beans they sell at the market that day will do. 
 Boil the living daylights out of them until they are easily mashable. 
 Mash half of the beans to smithereens. 
 In a deep pot pour in a gin bottle full of  oil  (half cup) or about a cup if you want it really Liberian. 
 If you want it more American, only put in enough to sauté one  onion . 
 Brown the  onions  and dump in a container of  tomato  paste. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to taste, one teaspoon of  red peppers , and a couple  chicken bouillon  cubes. 
 Pour in the mashed and unmashed beans into the pot and bury it all in  water  -- about a cup or two. 
 Then boil it all away. 
 When the soup is thick, it's done.
