Description 
 "Three Dollar Shoes" is a gin cocktail made with Seagram's and Bombay Sapphire brand gin. It also includes Margarita mixer for sweetness, and grenadine to give the drink a pink tint.
 The Three Dollar Shoes cocktail was invented in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 21 July 2006 as a strong but sweet cocktail to drink before going to a local club for Salsa dancing. Originally, the drink included only Seagram's and Margarita mixer. Bombay Sapphire was added to give a higher alcohol content, and drawing inspiration from one of the inventors recently purchased pink high-heel shoes (for three dollars), the grenadine was added to give the cocktail a pink tint.
 For serving the drink, a plastic water-bottle was used for ease and portability. In keeping with the original spirit of the cocktail, if at all possible the drink should be served from a large, cheap plastic bottle, though a drink mixer can be used instead.
