Description : 
 If you have ever had a  mango  Lassi at an Indian restaurant, here is the Irish version:
A while back someone posted a link to their grandfather's holiday  egg  nog recipe. I made it last year and it was amazing. Very, very strong and super rich. So first make that, but any nog will do:
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 parts  eggnog  (with  rum  and  whiskey  if it doesn't have it already) 
 2 parts  mango  and/or  papaya juice 
 1 part  rum  (yes, MORE  rum ) 
 Directions : 
 Mix well, serve with  ice . 
 Get smashed.
