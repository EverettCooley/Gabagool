Description : 
 Thanks to Julie, who shops at our Overland Park, Kansas store, for generously sharing her idea for this exceptional berry salad. Blueberries add a burst of sweet, acidic flavor and significant antioxidant nutrition. The olive oil and orange juice dressing is enlivened by lemon thyme leaves. Add grilled or broiled chicken or tempeh for a heartier meal.
