Ingredients : 
 1 cup  margarine 
 ¾ cup  icing sugar 
 ½ teaspoon  vanilla 
 1 tbsp instant  coffee  granules 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 and ¾ cups unbleached white  flour 
 chocolate  glaze 
 
 ¼ cup vegan  chocolate chips . (using the good, expensive ones, like tropical source brand, will bring a whole other dimension to these cookies.) 
 2 tbsp or more liquid of your choice (non-dairy  milk ,  coffee ,  water ); just enough to make the melted  chocolate  liquid-y and drizzley. 
 Directions : 
 Cream the  margarine  and  sugar  together until light and fluffy. 
 Add  vanilla . 
 Combine  coffee  granules and  flour . 
 Stir the  flour  mixture into creamed mixture and mix well. 
 Chill the dough before forming into ¾ inch balls. 
 Bake at 350 f for 18-20 minutes on an ungreased cookie sheet. 
 While they are baking, melt the  chocolate chips  and liquid together over low heat (a double boiler would be best). 
 When the cookies come out of the oven, and are still warm, place them on a sheet of waxed paper and, using a  butter  knife to scoop up the glaze, whip the  chocolate  around over them to create jackson pollock-esque designs on them.
