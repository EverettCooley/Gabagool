Description
 
 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cotechino (a thick  Sausage  made from  Pork  meat and rind and fat  Bacon ) weighing about 500 g [1Â lb] 
 200 g [7 oz] beans already soaked 
 20 g [3/4 oz]  butter 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 1  Onion 
 salt 
 freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Wash the cotechino, prick the skin with a fork and put it to cook for 3 hours over a low heat in a pan filled with cold, unsalted  water . 
 After it has been cooking for 1 hour, put the beans in abundant  water  in a separate pan and set to cook for 3 hours. 
 One hour before they are ready, gently fry the sliced  Onion  in  oil  and  butter , and after about 4 minutes, when it is lightly browned, add it to the beans, season with  salt  and  pepper  and stir well. 
 Take the cotechino out of the cooking  Liquor , which should then be degreased and added to the beans, a little at a time as needed, without stirring it in. 
 When the beans are cooked, add the cotechino, skinned and cut into slices, and leave for 5 minutes to absorb the flavour, then serve.
