 Cook Time : 40 minutes 
 Serves : 4 
 Ingredients 
 2 tbsp.  canola oil 
 1 medium-size  onion , white or yellow only, diced 
 1 medium-size Russet  potato , diced 
 3 cups  water 
 1 cup  basmati  or  long-grain rice 
 ¾ tsp.  salt , rock or iodized only 
 ½ tsp.  cumin  seeds 
 ¼ tsp. ground  turmeric 
 1 cup canned  chickpeas , rinsed and drained 
 Directions 
 In a fresh 3-quart saucepan over moderate heat, heat oil; add the onion and the potato. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Add water, rice, salt, cumin seeds, and turmeric; over high heat, heat to boiling. 
 Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice and potatoes are tender. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, just mix with chickpeas. Serve hot and plain but pair this turmeric-based rice dish with other main dishes. 
 Tips 
 Basmati rice is a special, toasty-flavored Indian rice. Now, it is also grown in the United States. If you don’t find it at the supermarket, use regular, long-grain rice.
