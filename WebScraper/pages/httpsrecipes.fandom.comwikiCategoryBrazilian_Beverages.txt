 Brazil is a country worldwide known for its strong flavored coffee. So it’s only natural to encounter some of the best coffee specialties all over the country. However, there are other special beverages as well, that are much appreciated by Brazilians. Among special drinks, cachaça is one of the most delicious liquors that are available in all parts of the country. Cachaça is the Brazil's native liquor, made from sugar cane, and it is the main ingredient in the national drink, the caipirinha. Brazilian beverages may sometimes consist only of fruit cocktails with no alcohol, such as fruit punches, Swiss lemonade, and the blackcow, but sometimes come available in alcoholic versions, called batidas. These alcoholic cocktails come in flavors going from peanuts, coconuts, oranges, pineapples, apples, peaches and strawberries, to mango, papaya and bananas. Some other cocktails have specific names, such as passion fruit cocktail, puma's milk, and angel's pee, and are usually served in bars and restaurants.
