 About sangria : 
 Although sometimes confused with  sangria , this Spanish/Mexican drink is never the same at all. There are many variations, but sangrita is typically a blended mixture of the tomatoes (or tomato juice), orange juice, and lemon or lime juice, with a fiery element added through chili peppers, chile powder or Tabasco sauce. Sangrita is served chilled, usually with a high shot of tequila.
