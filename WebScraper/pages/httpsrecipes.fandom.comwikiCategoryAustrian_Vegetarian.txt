 The common Austrian vegetarian diet is based on foods made from vegetables and other non-animal ingredients. It is known that most types of cheese in Austria are non-vegetarian, and most of the ones that don't contain any ingredients of animal provenience are not labeled this way. Hence, people can easily give up to the idea of eating cheese. Fortunately, producers have started to label the vegetarian products, lately. The most important vegetarian foods and beverages are: Gluehwein - a traditional Austrian drink, Green Cabbage and Apple Saut√©, Cold Wine Soup (Kalte Weinsuppe), Quark Spaetzle, Butterhorns (aka Rugelach/Rugulach/Snails/Schnecken), Chocolate Viennese Biscuits and Schaum Torte - Sea foam Cake.
