 DONUT GLAZE : 
  4 tablespoons Milk 
  3 teaspoons Vanilla 
  1 1/2 cups Powdered Sugar (sifted) 
 DONUT POPCORN : 
  10 Cups of Popped Popcorn 
  1/4 Cup Glaze

 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Donut Glaze
 
 Pour milk and vanilla into a saucepan. 
 On medium-low heat gently warm the milk and vanilla mixture stirring often. 
 When the milk is warm but not boiling take off the heat. 
 Slowly add 1 1/2 cups of sifted powdered sugar and stir until smooth. 
 Donut Popcorn
 
 Pop 10 cups of popcorn. 
 Pour the Donut Glaze over the salted popcorn. (You will not need it all. We used approximately 1/4 cup of the glaze.) 
 Gently fold the glaze in with the popcorn until the popcorn is mostly covered. 
 Pour the popcorn onto a cookie sheet covered with foil or a silpat liner. 
 Chop up 7-8 Donut Holes. 
 Sprinkle the chopped Donut Holes into the glazed popcorn. 
 Allow the Donut Popcorn to cool. Add some sprinkles!
