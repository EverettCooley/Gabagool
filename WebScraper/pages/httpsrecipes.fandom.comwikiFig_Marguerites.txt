 7/8 cup  sugar 
 3 tablespoons  water . 
 1  egg  white, unbeaten. 
 1 tablespoon  marshmallow   cream  and 
 Â¼ teaspoon  vanilla 
 1/3 cup (3)  figs  cut in small pieces. 
 Directions :

 Stir until  Sugar  is dissolved as much as possible. There will still be small  Sugar  crystals remaining. Wash  Sugar  crystals from inside of double boiler with pastry brush dipped in cold  water . 
 Add the egg white. Place over hot  water  and cook, beating constantly with  egg  beater for 7 to 12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape. 
 Add marshmallow cream and vanilla 
 Fold over and over until again stiff enough to hold its shape. 
 Add the figs 
 Pile on small round crackers 
 Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10 minutes or until delicately brown. 
 This rule will cover 3 dozen small crackers. Should frosting be too soft to hold its shape after adding  marshmallow   cream , it may be again placed over hot  water , and folded gently over and over, until it becomes slightly granular around the edges. Remove from hot  water , and continue folding over gently until of the desired stiffness.
