Every pregnant woman is concerned about the health of her unborn baby and the possibilities that he or she may have a birth defect. A birth defect represents an abnormality in the structure of the body or its functions that appears in the pre natal stage and it is present at birth. The birth defects can have severe consequences on the life of the whole family and in some cases it can lead to the death of the baby.
To make sure that her baby will be healthy and normal, future mothers have to visit their doctor, follow his instructions and try to maintain a healthy diet during the pregnancy and while she is breastfeeding. 
Broccoli is a vegetable that should be a part of every pregnant woman’s daily diet. This vegetable is rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients that are essential to a harmonious development of the foetus. The lack of vitamin A in the mother’s diet can cause blindness in the foetus while insufficient intake of vitamin B can produce developmental problems. The folate contained by broccoli is perhaps the most important compound that protects the unborn child from birth defects such as neural tube defects, defects of the heart or of the limbs and face. Folate is a vitamin B that is soluble in water. Its most important task is to produce and maintain new cells of the body. Folate is especially important during periods of fast cell growth such as pregnancy.
