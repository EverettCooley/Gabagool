 Description : 
 This may sound like a lot of  garlic , but the end result is delicious. This is my favorite  chicken  recipe as it is so easy and full of wonderful Thai flavours. Cook this in a ridged grill pan and serve with  green ginger   rice  and fiery  corn .
 
       Thai Garlic Chicken     
 Ingredients : 
 4 boneless  Chicken  breasts

 4 cloves  garlic , sliced thinly or crushed 
 1 tablespoon fresh  ginger , grated or finely chopped 
 1  limes , juice and rind of 
 3 tablespoons  sunflower oil 
 1 tablespoon dark  soy sauce 
 1 - 2 red  chiles , de-seeded and thinly sliced 
 ½ tablespoon dried  coriander

 Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a deep glass bowl. 
 Put the  chicken  pieces in the bowl, making sure to coat each piece thoroughly and press into gashes.

 Next cook the  chicken  with the cashews and  mushrooms  in a foil-lined oven pan at the top of a hot oven (250 °C) for 20-30 minutes, or grill/broil it, or cook on the BBQ at medium heat for 15 - 20 minutes until cooked through. 
 Keep basted with the marinade while cooking. 
 Serve with buttered  rice , perhaps some  wild rice  mixed in, along with fresh  greens  and a salad.
