Ingredients : 
 16 oz jar unsweetened  peanut butter 
 15 oz can  tomato sauce 
 6 oz can  tomato paste 
 1 to 3 large  onions , chopped 
 1 to 3 cloves  garlic , pressed or minced 
 1 to 3 cubes  bouillon 
 1 tsp  black pepper 
 110 degree Fahrenheit  red pepper  (if you like it hot) 
 2 tbsp  oil 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  peanut butter  in a bowl of 3 cups hot tap  water . 
 Stir until the  peanut butter  is well mixed, then set aside. 
 In another bowl, mix  onions ,  garlic , and  pepper  with the  tomato  paste. 
 Heat the  oil  strongly in a large sauce pan (small bits of  onions  should sizzle immediately when thrown in the  oil ) and add the  tomato  paste mixture, stirring the mess rapidly. 
 Saut√© for a minute or two before adding the adding the  tomato  sauce and watered down  peanut butter  to the sauce pan. 
 Add the bouillon and hot  red pepper  as you bring the sauce to a boil ( water  may need to be added if the sauce starts out too thick). 
 Reduce heat and cover so sauce can simmer. 
 Cook for about 30 minutes. 
 You will know the sauce is ready when  oil  separates out and float on top of the mixture in pools (sauce will end up very thick). 
 When finished, cool the sauce, spoon of excess  oil  if desired and put it in the fridge until the following day!. 
 The flavor is much nicer after allowing it to sit overnight. 
 Serve on the  rice ,  potatoes , cous-cous, etc. 
 Any type of shredded meat can be added to this sauce at the beginning of the simmering state.
