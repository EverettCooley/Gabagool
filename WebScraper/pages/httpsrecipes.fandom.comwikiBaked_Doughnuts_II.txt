 Ingredients : 
 2 pack  dry yeast  (½ oz) 
 1/3 cup warm  water 
 1 1/2 cup warm  milk 
 1/3 cup  vegetable shortening 
 1/4 cup  Sugar 
 2 tsp  salt 
 2 tsp  nutmeg , fresh ground 
 1/2 cup  egg  beaters 
 4 1/2 cup  flour , all purpose 
 1/2 cup melted  butter 
 1 cup  cinnamon  and  Sugar  mix 
 Directions : 
 Sprinkle  yeast  over warm  water  and let dissolve for five minutes. Put  milk  and  shortening  in a small sauce pan and warm until  shortening  melts. Cool to lukewarm. Pour  yeast  mixture into a mixing bowl; add  milk  mixture,  egg  beaters,  nutmeg ,  salt , and 2 cups  flour . Beat briskly until well mixed. Add remaining  flour  and mix well. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Dough will be soft but manageable. Pat the dough into a circle about ½ inch thick. Cut doughnuts out with a three inch doughnut cutter. Place doughnuts on a greased baking sheet and let rise, uncovered for about 20 minutes. (doughnuts do not spread much, you can place them about 1 inch apart on baking sheet). Preheat oven to 450 deg f. Bake about 10 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and brush with melted  butter . Sprinkle with  cinnamon  and  Sugar  mix. Variation:instead of cinnamon- Sugar  mix, let doughnuts cool after brushing with  butter . When cool dip in glaze made with  powdered sugar  and  milk . Makes about 30 doughnuts. Each doughnut = 125 calories, 3.9 g fat. (28.5% calories from fat)
