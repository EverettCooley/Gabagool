Ingredients : 
 1 small package  enoki mushrooms 
 5 to 6 large dried  shiitake mushrooms 
 1 large can  straw mushrooms 
 3 to 4  black fungus  mushrooms  or  any variety of  mushroom  you're comfy with — I used a dried version of these and they became huge! 
 8 cups  water 
 ¼ cup dry  sherry   or   rice wine 
 ⅓ cup  cider vinegar 
 2 tbsp  soy sauce 
 2 to 3  egg whites 
 3 sliced  scallions 
 ¼ to ½ tsp  white pepper 
 2 tbsp  cornstarch 
 Directions : 
 Boil 2 cups of the  water  and pour it over the shiitake and fungus and any ever other dried  mushrooms  you may have chosen. 
 Let this sit in a bowl for 30 minutes. 
 When the  mushrooms  have finished soaking, squeeze the juice out of them and cut them into bit sized pieces; do not use the stems. 
 Pour the soaking juice into a large soup pan with 5½ cups of  water . 
 Bring the  water  and all the  mushrooms  except the  enoki mushrooms  to a boil. 
 Add  rice wine  or  sherry , soy sauce and  vinegar . 
 Reduce the heat and allow mixture to simmer for at least 10 minutes. 
 (if you"re trying to get other dishes to come out at the same time, this is a good place to just let the mixture simmer till youire ready for it!). 
 Mix the  cornstarch  and the remaining ½ cup of cool  water  in a cup. 
 Whisk the mixture into the hot soup. 
 This is the possible lump stage, but with all the  mushrooms  and  egg whites , who will know?). 
 Drizzle the  egg whites  into the soup, whisking or stirring constantly. 
 Add the  white pepper . 
 Wait 2-3 minutes and then dish up the soup, garnishing each bowl with scallions and  enoki mushrooms . 
 (these last add a lot of flavor!).
