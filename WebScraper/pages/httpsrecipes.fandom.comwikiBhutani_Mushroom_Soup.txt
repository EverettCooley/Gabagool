 1 tablespoon minced  ginger 
 1 tablespoon minced  garlic 
 1 minced  shallot 
 ½ lb  ground meat  (your choice) 
 5 dried  black mushrooms  (soaked in hot  water  for 30 minutes, de-stemmed and sliced) 
 ½ cup  tree ears , soaked and shredded 
 15-20 dried  lily buds , soaked, trimmed and cut in half 
 ½ cup shredded  bamboo shoots 
 ½ cup shredded  carrots  (pre-shredded from a bag) 
 4 ounces  cellophane noodles , soaked, drained and cut into 2-inch lengths. (2 pouches, each pouch is twinky-size) 
 2 tablespoons  mushroom   soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon  black vinegar  (or more) 
 1 tablespoon  mirin  or  sherry  wine 
 ¼ teaspoon  white pepper , ground 
 1-2 tablespoon  chili oil  (the kind with the seeds and bits floating on the bottom-shake it up before using) 
 1  green onion , chopped (for garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Pour stock into big sauce pan, add  ginger , garlic  and  Shallots . Bring to a boil. 
 Add ground meat and poach until cooked, breaking into chunks as you go. 
 Add everything else and simmer for 5–10 minutes, adding more  vinegar  or  chile   oil  to taste. 
 The ingredients soak up a lot of the broth so I didn't bother trying to thicken it. 
 Ladle into bowls,sprinkle with  green onion ,
