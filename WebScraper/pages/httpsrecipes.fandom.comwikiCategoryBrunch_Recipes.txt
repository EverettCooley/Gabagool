The brunch is the meal that you eat between breakfast and lunch and its consistence is enough to replace both of them. The term is a blend of the terms breakfast and lunch. This meal can be served in the morning, but it can also be served at an afternoon event, being a relaxed meal is an excellent choice for informal celebrations. There are restaurants that serve brunch only on weekends or holidays and are often served as buffets. This meal usually consists of standard breakfast foods like eggs, pancakes, sausages, bacon, ham, fruits, pastries, but it can also include any other type of food. Brunch is usually sold as a premium meal and it can be served as late as 5 p.m. while the usual time would be till 2 or 3 p.m.. For the ones who are not used with this kind of meal it could be quite a challenge to distinguish it between lunch and breakfast. A humorist once noticed that “brunch is a meal that costs as much as breakfast and lunch combined”.
 
Even if the brunch menu could be the same as a lunch menu in a different restaurant it is supported by the purveyor through pricing in order that the brunch identity is preserved. Here are some marketing techniques that brunch purveyors use: the maintaining of the term brunch in the menu, the use of a fancy and luxurious dress code for the staff, the alignment of the restaurant with a food movement, the changing of some ingredients in the dishes’ componence so that it seems more eccentric, the replacement of the usual syrup with cream-based sauces that are generally used for dinner deserts, the adding of some exotic flair to the dish by adding some migas or quiche to it, the use of some flavors that are not the common ones such as gingerbread, pumpkin or buckwheat.
