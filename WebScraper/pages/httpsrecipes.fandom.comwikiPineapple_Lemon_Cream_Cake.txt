Pineapple Lemon Cream Cake
 1 box (2 layer) yellow or white cake mix
1 small box lemon jello
1 c. boiling water
1 15 oz. can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 small box instant vanilla pudding
8 oz. carton frozen dessert topping; thawed
 Preheat oven as directed on cake mix. Grease a 9 x 13 pan.
Prepare cake as directed on package and bake. As soon as it is out of 
the oven, combine the boiling water with the jello. With a fork poke 
holes all over the cake. Slowly pour the jello over the cake so it is 
absorbed into the cake. Mix together the pineapple, instant pudding and 
dessert topping. Spread over the cake. Refrigerate before serving.
