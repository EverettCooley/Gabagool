 Description : 
 Depending on the size of the  yams  you are able to buy, and what you are eating it with, each tuber should feed about 4-6 people.
 
 Ingredients : 
 yams 
 water 
 salt 
 vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  yam  up into small strips. 
 Put  vegetable oil  into a pot, until it is at least 2Â inches (or about 5 centimeters) high...it should cover the strips completely while cooking. Place on low heat, and allow it to heat up. 
 Once the  oil  is hot, place some of the strips into the  oil . Allow it to cook and fry the strip, making sure that it cooks to the inside. 
 yams  usually don't soak up much  oil , but if you want, you can place them directly on napkins to soak up some of the extra  oil .
