Description : 
 Stiff porridge
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¼ cups white  cornmeal 
 1 cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Heat a cup of  water  to boiling in a medium-size saucepan. 
 Meanwhile, in a bowl or measuring cup, gradually add ¾ cup of the  cornmeal  to the  milk , stirring briskly to make a smooth paste. 
 Add the mixture to the boiling  water , continuing to stir constantly. 
 Cook for 4 or 5 minutes while adding the remaining  cornmeal . 
 When the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pot and stick together, remove from heat. 
 Dump bidia into a bowl. 
 Then, with damp hands, shape it into a smooth ball, flipping it so that the rounded sides of the bowl help to smooth it. 
 Serve immediately. 
 To eat in the traditional manner, tear off a small chunk and make an indentation in it with your thumb. 
 Use this hollow as a “bowl” to scoop up sauces and stews. 
 Variations : for a less conventional, but delicious porridge, dump half a cup of yellow  cornmeal  into a cup or more of boiling  water . 
 It will form lumps, but if you stir and mash vigorously with a strong wire whisk, the lumps will disappear. 
 Add more  cornmeal  as necessary until you have a consistency similar to  cream of wheat . 
 Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring constantly. 
 Serve hot.
