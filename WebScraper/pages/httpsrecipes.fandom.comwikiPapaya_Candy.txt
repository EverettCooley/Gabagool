 2Â½ lbs firm  papaya 
 2 lbs  sugar

 Directions : 
 Cut the  papaya  into fine strips, then peel and wash well. 
 Place the  papaya  and  sugar  on on a slow fire until the  sugar  dissolves. 
 Cook for ten minutes, then set aside for a half hour. 
 After a half an hour reheat at a higher flame, until the mixture becomes sugar-like or crystalized. 
 Shortly afterwards remove from heat, and, using a spoon and fork, mold into different shapes.
