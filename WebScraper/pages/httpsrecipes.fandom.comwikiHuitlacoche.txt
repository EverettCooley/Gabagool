 About Huitlacoche : 
 Cuitlacoche is a fungus that attacks ears of corn and causes the kernels to swell to 10 times their normal size. Cuitlacoche has a smoky-sweet flavor with hints of corn and mushroom. It is sold canned and frozen in gourmet markets. It's used in a variety of dishes--typically appropriate for dishes that call for cooked mushrooms.
