Description : 
       Thai Mango Salad With Marinated Shrimps     
 I sort "threw together" this salad for my Asian X'mas dinner. Very refreshing and can be made up to 3 – 4 hours ahead. This salad is made in a few stages - all very easy and quick. The wonton cups can be made a day ahead, stored in an airtight container. Assemble just before serving, so that the wonton cups don't get soggy. If you want to assemble ahead, serve in small  lettuce  cups. You can also use  Scallops  instead of shrimps.

 15  wonton wrappers 
 15 medium  shrimp , with shells on 
 1 stalk  lemongrass 
 ¼ inch  ginger , sliced

 2 tablespoons  fish sauce 
 2 tablespoons  lemongrass , chopped finely 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 Salad : 
 1 Thai  mango, unripe , julienned 
 1 small  cucumber , julienned (I use  Japanese cucumber ) 
 Thai bird's eye chilis , chopped (I use 4) 
 1 small  Granny Smith apples , julienned (use any tart  Apple ) 
 ¼ cup  cilantro , chopped 
 fresh ground  black pepper 
 dry roasted salted  peanuts , chopped coarsely,to garnish (optional)

 Directions : 
 Wonton cups : 
 First, make the wonton cups: press wonton wrappers into greased muffin cups, bake them for 10 minutes at 350°F; cool and store them in airtight container up to 1 day ahead. 
 Add  lemongrass ,  ginger ,  lime  zest and juice to approx 2 cups of  water  (enough  water  to cover the shrimps) and bring to boil in a small saucepan. 
 Poach the shrimps in the stock for 5 – 10 minutes, until shrimps just turned pink (do not overcook); remove and cool. 
 Peel the shrimps and set aside. 
 Dressing/Marinade : 
 Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. 
 Place cooled shrimps in a ziplock bag, and pour in the dressing; marinate shrimps for 1 – 2 days in the fridge for best results. 
 A few hours before serving, combine all salad ingredients except the  black pepper  and garnish, in a medium non-reactive bowl. 
 Add the shrimps and dressing, toss to coat and chill. 
 Assembly : 
 Place wonton cups on serving platter/tray. 
 Arrange salad in the cups, topped them each with a  shrimp . 
 Sprinkle with fresh ground  pepper  and chopped  nuts  and garnish with fresh  parsley / cilantro  before serving.
