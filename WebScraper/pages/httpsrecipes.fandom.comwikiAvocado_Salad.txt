 Description : 
 This is my version of  avocado  salad. Since my family likes highly seasoned foods I came up with this idea so that guest could have their salad to their own liking.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  California avocados , mashed 
 4  green onions , chopped 
 4 medium  tomatoes , chopped 
 4 large jalapeño, chopped 
 lettuce , shredded 
 oil  and  vinegar  in carafes 
 Directions : 
 Line each salad plate with a little shredded  lettuce , place 1  avocado  mashed on one side of plate, place 1  tomato  chopped next to  avocado , place 1 jalapano chopped next to  tomato  and place 1  green onion  chopped next to jalapeño. 
 Pass the  oil  and  vinegar  carafes around so that guest can mix salad as they wish.
 Place individual small containers of hot salsa in front of each guest along with small baskets of chips,  salt  and  pepper .
