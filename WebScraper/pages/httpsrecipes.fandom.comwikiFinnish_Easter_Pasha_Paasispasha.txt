Description : 
 Pasha is traditionally baked in a special wooden mold that has the orthodox Easter symbols carved into the sides so that they are impressed on the dessert when it is unmolded. For the clearest impression of the designs when using a pasha mold, use no more than two layers of cheesecloth. If you don't have a pasha mold, a clean five to six inch clay or plastic flower pot with drain holes on the bottom makes a rather pretty substitute.
 
 10 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup heavy (whipping)  cream 
 ½ cup  unsalted butter , at room temperature 
 1 cup  sugar 
 4  eggs 
 3 pints  ricotta cheese 
 ½ cup  sour cream 
 ½ cup minced  almonds 
 ½ cup  raisins , fresh fruit,  berries  or preserves

 Place a 1-pound weight (such as a pound of  butter  or a can of vegetables or fruit) on top.
