      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 This time it’s “Chicken-a-la-Route79”.
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Get some  Chicken : skinless, boneless,  Chicken  thighs from your high-street butcher shop. Wash and chop up into bite-size pieces. I used around 750g today. This will cook enough for 4 hungry adults. Do not use  Chicken  breast - as  Chicken  breast is so dry and bland - and the end-result will be really crap. Goodness knows why  Chicken  breast is so expensive here in UK - it’s the worst, most tasteless, pointless part of the  Chicken . The thigh or leg actually has the tastie and is a better texture when cooked - and yet it’s a lot cheaper than breast! Bizzare hey? Not sure I understand this logic - but I’m not complaining! Also peel around 4 small/medium  onions  - and wash and de-seed around 4  peppers  - two large green, 2 small/medium red. You will also need a couple of tins of peeled  plum tomato  - and the usual spices: haldi ( turmeric ),  salt , ground-dhania (coriander) and  garam masala  - as well as some pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie. Plenty of  garlic  and  ginger  for this much  Chicken . Also - not shown in the picture is a bunch of fresh coriander. I used some frozen, chopped coriander - which was prepared weeks ago by moi from several bunches of fresh coriander from the grocer shop.
 
 Directions : 
 OK - so chop all the  onions  into coarse-ish strips. Also chop all the  peppers  into bite-sized chunks. And get an electric blender ready. Open up the tins of  plum tomato  - and pour the contents of one of them into the blender.
 
       Prepare a blender.Chop the onions.Chop the peppers     
         Pour tin if tomato into blender     
 
Then add some pieces of the chopped  green pepper  - about 1  peppers  worth. Give it a good 15 second zap. Then add a bunch of fresh  coriander leaf  - stalks and all. Zap for another 15 seconds or so.
 
         Add some pieces of green pepper     
         Then add some coriander leaves     
 
Then add the pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie - add the second tin of  tomato  - and zap it for another 10 seconds. What you should have is a thick dark green-ish sauce - which you should then pour into a large bowl. Then add the powdered spices to the sauce bowl: about 3 heaped teaspoons of haldi, 3 or 4 heaped teaspoons of  garam masala  - 2 teaspoons of  salt , and 2 heaps of ground coriander. Don’t be put off by the colour of the sauce at this point - a dark dirty-green swamp type sauce - when it cooks it will go a wonderfully aromatic rich reddish-brown!
 
 
         And finally throw in the garlic,ginger and chillie     
         Pour mixture into bowl and add spices     
 
Stir in the ground spices thoroughly. It was at this point that little MissRoute79 came running into kitchen and pleaded with me if she could help me. So - I let her stir it around. (She had to stand on a foot-stool to reach!) You also need to get the  onions  cooking out now. Put plenty of  oil  into a large cooking pan - and stir fry the  onions  until they start to become translucentish. This might take around 10 mins.
 
         Give it a good stir     
         Frying the onions     
 
Then add the remaining chunks of red and  green pepper  - and stir fry until the  onions  have started to go goldenish brown. At this point - pour in the chopped  Chicken  thighs - and stir fry carefully.
 
         Add the remaining peppers to the stir-fry     
         When the onions are getting brown put the chicken     
 Stir-fry the  Chicken  until the  Chicken  has turned from slimy-pink to rubbery-white. At this point you should pour the spicy sauce mixture over the  Chicken .
 
 
         Stir-fry until chicken is white-ish     
         Add the sauce mixture     
 Give the pot a good, thorough stir - ensuring all the  Chicken  is covered in the sauce. Do this whilst the flame is on really high - so that eventually the whole pot starts to boil nearly fiercely!
 
 
         Give it a good stir     
         Bring to fierce boil     
 
Now lower the flame to the lowest you can go - and place a lid on the pot - leaving a little gap for steam to escape - and the sauce to reduce. Leave it slow-simmering like this for about 1 hour - coming back to stir it around every 15 minutes or so. Then take a taste of the sauce with a spoon - to test if there’s enough  salt  or spices. If not - add some more  salt  and  garam masala  - and keep tasting until it tastes perfect.
 
 
         Lower flame to very gentle simmer     
         Stir every 15 mins.Then it's done     
 
Voila! It’s done. Put lid back on - and you can reheat it later when you wish to serve. You can call it a “ Chicken   curry ” if you like - but because it’s got green and  red peppers  in it - you might want to call it “ Chicken  jalfrezi” - call it whatever you like. This way of cooking it was taught to me by my mum when I was a college kid. Serve it on a bed of freshly-cooked  basmati rice  - with a salad accompaniment - and a side-plate of a couple of fresh green chillies (if you can cope with biting into fresh green chillie) or achaar (pickle). Because that’s exactly how I’m going to have it tonight!
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
