Cenovis  is a product based on yeast extract similar to  Marmite  and  Vegemite , rich in vitamin B1. In the form of a dark brown food paste, it is used to flavour soups, sausages, and salads. The most popular way to consume Cenovis is, however, to spread it on a slice of buttered bread.
 Cenovis is popular in Switzerland, where it was developed in 1931 and is produced today by the company Cenovis SA.
 People are said to usually have a very strong feeling for Cenovis when they taste some for the first time, either loving or hating it. It is usually cited as an acquired taste, being a product which one has to grow up with to appreciate.
