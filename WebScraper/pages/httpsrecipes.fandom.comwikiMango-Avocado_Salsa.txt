Description : 
       Mango-Avocado Salsa     
 This is an easy tropical dish that is full of flavor! I like to serve it with chips, or as a side dish. It would be easy to try slightly different versions by adding  lime juice ,  ginger ,  pineapple , or  jalapenos , depending on your personal taste. If you have any other suggestions, I would love to hear them! Thanks!
