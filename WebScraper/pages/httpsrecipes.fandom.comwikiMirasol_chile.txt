 About Mirasol chile : 
 Chiles are found in 2 main colors: red and green. In fact, all the green peppers are unripe red ones and that is why their taste is not as hot as the one of the red chiles. The mirasol chiles are also called guajillo chiles and they have a special flavor, which is maintained even if they are dried. The mirasols are found in a bright color of orange-red; they are thin and have a medium length. The heat of the mirasol chiles is direct, flavored and intense and that is why it is used a lot in mild and soft meals, like soups, stews or sauces. 
 The Mexican recipes include a variety of tacos and quesadillas and salads based on veggies and greens (tomatoes, spinach, cucumbers, corn, beans and black beans), but only served with the traditional salsas or dips, which are always made of hot chiles and peppers, like the mirasol chile. Besides these, the morita chiles are used in various Spanish soups, which also contain the traditional red beans.
