 About Feta 
 This classic  cheese  is traditionally made from sheep's or  goat's milk , although today large commercial producers often make it with  cow's milk . Because it's cured and stored in its own salty whey brine, feta is often referred to as pickled cheese. White, crumbly and rindless, feta is usually pressed into square cakes. It has a rich, tangy flavor, contains from 45 to 60 percent milk fat and can range in texture from soft to semi-dry. Feta makes a zesty addition to salads and many cooked dishes.
