       Cream Horns (Šaumrole)     
 Ingredients : 
 For the  puff pastry 
 
 1 cup (2 sticks)  unsalted butter  or  margarine , softened 
 3 ½ cup all purpose  flour 
 ¾ cup  ice   water 
 1 cup (2 sticks)  unsalted butter , chilled 
 For the filling 
 
 4  egg whites 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 3 tsp fresh  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Cut soft  butter  into small pieces. Work  butter  into the  flour  using your fingers. Make a well in the center. Add  ice   water  and work all ingredients together to form soft smooth dough.
 Roll the dough to an oblong shape ½ inch thick. The dough should be evenly thick. Cut cold  butter  into cubes and arrange evenly on the dough. Fold narrow sides of dough into center. Roll out again to rectangle shape. The  butter  will mix in with the dough. Fold the dough again and then wrap and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Repeat the same method of rolling, folding and 30 minutes chilling, 4 to 5 times. This is how the puffy layers in the dough are formed.
 Preheat oven to 375°F. At the final stage, roll out the dough to a 1/2 – inch thickness, and using a sharp knife, cut long strips about ¼ inch wide. Wrap around the  cream  horn mold (cannoli molds). Keep baking tray chilled before putting puffed pastry dough on. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until puffy and golden. Cool before filling.
 In large bowl, whip  egg whites  until stiff, gradually adding  Sugar . Add a few s of  lemon juice  for flavour. Fill  cream  horns, using pastry bag. Keep in refrigerator until serving.
