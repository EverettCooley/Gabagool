 This came from a Cajun Cookbook that my friend had loaned to me. The prep. time does not include soaking the beans overnight.

 2 cups dried  red kidney beans , soaked overnight and drained 
 2 tablespoons  butter 
 1 large  onion , peeled and chopped 
 1 clove  garlic , peeled and minced 
 1 stalk  celery  and leaves, chopped 
 1  carrot , peeled and chopped 
 ½ lb smoked  ham , cut into large chunks 
 1 large  ham bone , if available 
 2 quarts  water 
 1 tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh  parsley 
 ½ teaspoon dried  thyme 
 2  bay leaves 
 2 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 ⅛ teaspoon dried hot  red pepper flakes 
 salt  and  pepper 
 chopped fresh  parsley  (to garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Put the beans in a saucepan, cover with fresh  water  and bring to a boil. 
 Boil for 10 minutes and drain. 
 Set aside. 
 Melt the  butter  in a dutch oven or very large saucepan and cook the  onion ,  garlic ,  celery  and  carrot , covered, until softened. 
 Add the beans,  ham ,  ham  bone,  water ,  Worcestershire sauce ,  parsley ,  thyme ,  bay leaves ,  lemon juice ,  pepper  flakes, and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Bring to a boil and simmer 2 hours or until beans are very soft. 
 Discard the  ham  bone. 
 Scoop out the chunks of  ham  and reserve. 
 Press the soup through a fine sieve and return it to the saucepan. 
 Discard the solids in the sieve. 
 Cut the chunks of  ham  into small dice and add to the soup. 
 Reheat, and taste and adjust the seasonings. 
 Serve hot, sprinkled with a little  parsley .
