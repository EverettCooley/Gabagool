       Vanillekipferln     
 Ingredients : 
 2¼ cups  flour 
 2 cups  confectioner's sugar 
 ½ cup blanched  almonds , finely ground 
 3 (9 g) packets  vanilla sugar 
 1 pinch  salt 
 ½ lb cold  unsalted butter , cut into small pieces 
 ¼ teaspoon  lemon extract 
 1 tablespoon  milk 
 Directions : 
 Combine  flour , ¾ cup of the  confectioners' sugar ,  almonds , 2 of the  vanilla   sugar  packets, and  salt  on a clean surface, shape into a mound, then make a well in the center. 
 Add  butter  and  lemon extract  to well. 
 Using your fingers, work flour-nut mixture into  butter  until dough resembles coarse meal. 
 Sprinkle  milk  over dough, knead until smooth, and shape into a ball. 
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Sift remaining  confectioners' sugar  and  vanilla   sugar  into a medium bowl and set aside. 
 Divide dough into 16 equal pieces. 
 Using your hands, roll each piece of dough out on a clean surface into ¾ inch thick ropes. 
 Cut ropes crosswise into 2½ inch pieces, then gently pinch ends to round off edges. 
 Shape pieces of dough into small crescents and transfer to parchment paper-lined baking sheets. 
 Bake until golden around edges, 12 – 14 minutes. 
 Allow cookies to cool for 1 minute then transfer a few at a time to bowl of  sugar  and coat well. 
 Transfer cookies to a rack to cool completely. 
 Cookies may be stored in airtight containers for up to 1 week.
