 Description : 
 Purchased from the McDonald Estate in Wylie, Texas in 1990. Dated 1976. Talk about incredible. This is tried and true and though it takes effort, it is well worth it. If you want to impress somebody, this is the one. I have also made this recipe with  Tilapia  and fresh  Tuna .
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 fresh  salmon  fillets, approximately 8 ounces each 
 3 tablespoons  Mayonnaise 
 2 cups fresh  cranberries 
 1-cup fresh  orange juice 
 1-cup fresh  grapefruit juice 
 ½ cup  granulated sugar 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 1-cup  blueberries 
 Zest from 1  orange 
 1-teaspoon ground  coriander 
 1-teaspoon  ground ginger 
 1-teaspoon ground  cumin 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 ½ teaspoon  kosher salt 
 1-cup fresh  strawberries 
 1-cup fresh  raspberries 
 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1-teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Place the  cranberries , juices,  Sugar , and  cinnamon  stick in a small saucepot over high heat. 
 When the mixture comes to a boil, heat to a simmer and cook until the  cranberries  start to break down and open up. 
 Let the mixture cool slightly and add the  orange  zest, spices, and  blueberries . 
 Mix well and cool further. 
 Add  strawberries ,  raspberries , and  pepper . 
 Mix well. 
 Refrigerate overnight to blend flavors, taste adjust seasoning if necessary. 
 Mixture will last for several days in the refrigerator. 
 Coat salmon fillet with a thin layer of  Mayonnaise . 
 Place on a hot grill and cook for 2–3 minutes on each side until fillet is firm to the touch and begins to flake. 
 This should be approximately medium rare. 
 Remove from the grill and place on a hot dinner plate with your favorite accompaniments. 
 Spoon salsa over half of the fillet.
