 Wikipedia Article  About Sbrinz on Wikipedia 
 Sbrinz is a very hard cheese produced in central Switzerland. It is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine.
 The cheese is produced in only 42 dairies in central Switzerland. Only local milk is used when producing this cheese. It is kept in the region until ready for consumption.
 Contrary to popular belief, the name Sbrinz does not originally refer to a particular place or region. Nevertheless, the Swiss Cheese Union added to this myth by launching an advertising campaign in the 1990s. As a result of this campaign, there is now an area called Sbrinz.
 A hard grating cheese that originated in the central mountains of Switzerland. It's made from whole cow's milk and contains 45 to 50 percent milk fat. Aged from 2 to 3 years, Sbrinz has a dark yellow interior with a brownish-yellow rind. If aged less than this, it is called Spalen. The rich mellow flavor of Sbrinz makes it ideal for both cooking and as a table cheese.
