After searching the internet for a good Chinese Spareribs recipe and not finding any that caught my eye, I decided to make my own. This recipe is pretty simple, and yields tender, juicy, tangy ribs. In Japan, I cooked this in the broiler, but it should be fine on the grill or in the oven." Original recipe yield: 2 servings.

 3 tablespoons  hoisin sauce 
 1 tablespoon  ketchup 
 1 tablespoon  honey

 1 teaspoon grated  fresh ginger 
 ½ teaspoon grated fresh  garlic 
 ¼ teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder 
 1 pound  pork  spareribs

 Mix the hoisin sauce, honey, soy sauce,  ketchup ,  sake , rice vinegar,  lemon juice ,  garlic ,  ginger , and  five spice  powder on the ribs. Let them sit for 2 hours 
 Add the ribs to a broiler and cook at 325 °F for 40 minutes, turing and brushing as needed.
