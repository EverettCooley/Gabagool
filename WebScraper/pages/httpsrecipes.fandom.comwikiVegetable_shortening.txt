 About Shortening : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Shortening on Wikipedia 
 Shortening is a semisolid fat used in food preparation, especially baked goods, and is so called because it inhibits the formation of long gluten strands in wheat-based doughs, giving them a "short" texture (as in shortbread). Shortening can be made from animal fat (lard), but is more commonly a hydrogenated vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature. Shortening has a higher smoke point than butter and margarine, and it has 100% fat content, compared to 80% for butter and margarine. Crisco, a popular brand, was first produced in 1911.
 Despite its worldwide usage and availability, vegetable shortening is damaging to human health since it generally contains trans fats.
