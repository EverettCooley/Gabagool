Description : 
 I have a good  banana 's Foster style recipe for Date Night.. A close lady friend of mine calls it Orgasm in a Bowl. (Not to be confused with Wet Dream with a Crust.) It's quick and easy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  banana  per person, sliced. 
 1/2 cup of  butter 
 1 cup of  brown sugar  (light or dark) 
 1/4 cup of dark rum (Bacardi Gold will do, Myers is better) 
 vanilla  Ice  cream . 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  butter  over medium to medium/high heat in a large skillet. 
 Add the  brown sugar  and stir until dissolved/melted. 
 Stir in the rum and give the mix a couple of minutes to heat up. 
 Then fry the  banana  slices on medium for about 3â€“5 minutes on each side or to your (or hers/his) taste. 
 As long as the heat isn't too high, they won't burn. Then serve hot over  vanilla  ice cream. 
 Experiment. Want a thicker sauce? 
 Add more  Sugar  or let the sauce reduce a bit before adding the bananas. Thinner? more rum.
