 Ingredients : 
 2-3  red onions  (try to pick large ones — the recipe called for regular onions, I chose to use red ones) 
 ⅓ lb ground meat ( beef   or   lamb ) 
 ¼ cup  rice 
 1½ tbsp  butter 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 tbsp  tomato paste 
 2 tbsp  red pepper paste  (if you cannot find it, use  tomato paste ) 
 ⅓ cup crushed dried  sumac 
 1 tsp dried  mint  flakes 
 1 tsp  oregano  leaves 
 1 tsp  cumin 
 1 tsp  black pepper 
 1 tsp or more  crushed red pepper  flakes 
 1 cup hot water 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Cut the bottom parts of onions ¼ inch and peel. 
 Boil them until soft, but not too soft. Rinse and let cool down. 
 Squeeze each one to get every single layer. You will be stuffing those layers. If slippery, use a clean kitchen towel to grip and squeeze. 
 Wash rice in plenty water and rinse. 
 Soak sumac in hot water for 15 minutes and drain. Save the water. 
 Heat butter in a frying pan. 
 Add pastes, spices, and salt. Mix well and cook for 3-4 minutes. 
 Take the pan off the fire. 
 Add ground meat, rice, and sumac. Mix well. 
 Stuff onions with the mix and place them in a broad pot. 
 Pour in sumac water. 
 After it starts boiling, simmer covered on low for half an hour. 
 Serve hot with crusty bread. 
 We loved it, especially with yogurt.
