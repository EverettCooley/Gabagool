 Prep Time: about 30 minutes | Cook Time: 4 1/2 to 9 hours 
 Servings: 8 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can (about 14 oz) no-salt-added diced  tomatoes 
 8 oz frozen cut  okra 
 2 cups chopped  green bell peppers 
 1 cup chopped  yellow onions 
 ¾ cup sliced  celery 
 1 cup fat-free, reduced sodium  chicken broth 
 2 tsp  Worcestershire sauce 
 1 tsp dried  thyme 
 1  bay leaf 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 lb  chicken  tenders, cut up 
 1½ tsp  sugar substitute 
 ¾ tsp  Creole seasoning 
 hot pepper sauce  (optional) 
 ¼ cup chopped fresh  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Lightly coat 3½- to 4-quart slow cooker liner with nonstick cooking spray. 
 Add tomatoes, okra, bell peppers, onions, celery, broth, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and bay leaf. 
 Cover; cook on  low  9 hours or on  high  4½ hours. 
 Heat oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat. 
 Add chicken; cook,stirring frequently, 6 minutes or until lightly browned. 
 Add chicken to slow cooker, along with remaining ingredients except parsley. 
 Increase slow cooker temperature to high. 
 Cook 15 minutes. 
 Stir in parsley. 
 Notes : 
 The okra does not need to be thawed. 
 To help ensure even cooking, I like to have the slow-cooker liner at least half full, but not more than two-thirds full. 
 I add seared chicken last so it doesn't overcook. Searing the chicken in olive oil first adds flavor. 
 I also add a little sweetener to the slow cooker to counteract acids in the tomatoes.
