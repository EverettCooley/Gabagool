 Description : 
 This is an authentic, 'home-style' dish served in Taiwanese homes. You can vary the easy-to-buy ingredients however you want to yield as many servings as you want. Try adding a couple of tablespoons of whole kernel  corn . Super easy to make, kids can do it too! Tender noodles coupled with subtle  chicken broth , all with succulent pieces of  Chicken , exotic shitake  Mushrooms  and a slow-simmered  egg  ... my favorite rainy-day meal!"
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 ounces dry  Chinese noodles 
 1 (14.5 ounce) can  chicken broth 
 6 shiitake  Mushrooms , sliced 
 2  green onions , chopped 
 1 skinless, boneless  Chicken  breast half 
 2  eggs 
 Directions : 
 1 Bring a large pot of  water  to a boil. Stir noodles into boiling  water  and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. (For a chewier texture, shock the noodles by pouring 1 cup cold  water  into the pot when it starts to foam, then letting it come to a boil again to finish cooking.) Drain and divide into two serving bowls. 
 2 Meanwhile, bring  chicken broth  to boil in a medium saucepan with  Mushrooms  and  green onions . Cut  Chicken  into bite-sized pieces and stir into boiling broth. When broth returns to a boil, crack  eggs  into broth. Continue to cook until  Chicken  is no longer pink and  eggs  are cooked, about 10 minutes. Pour the  Chicken  soup over the noodles in the bowls and serve immediately.
