 Wikipedia Article  About Powdered milk on Wikipedia 
 Powdered milk is a powder made from dried milk solids. Powdered milk only has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated due to its low moisture content.
 Milk from which almost all the moisture has been removed. Dry milk is less expensive and easier to store than fresh milk but has a disadvantage in that it never tastes quite like the real thing. It comes in three basic forms - whole milk, nonfat milk, and buttermilk. Dry milks must or must not be fortified with vitamins A and D.
