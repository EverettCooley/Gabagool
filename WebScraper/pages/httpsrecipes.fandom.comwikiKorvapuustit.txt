       Korvapuustit     
 Finnish cinnamon rolls
 
 Ingredients : 
 25 g  yeast 
 75 g  butter  or  margarine 
 300 ml  milk 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 50 ml  sugar 
 ¾ teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 750 ml  all-purpose flour 
 Filling : 
 100 g  butter  or  margarine , room temperature 
 100 ml  sugar 
 2 teaspoons  cinnamon 
 For brushing : 
 1  egg , beaten for brushing 
 Directions : 
 Crumble  yeast  into a bowl. 
 Melt  butter , add  milk  and gently heat the mixture to 37°C. 
 Pour over  yeast  and mix until  yeast  has dissolved. 
 Add  salt ,  sugar ,  cardamom  and stir; add about 200 ml of the  flour  and stir. 
 Add the rest of the  flour  and knead dough by hand until smooth and elastic, and it no longer sticks to the bowl (this shouldn't take long) nor to your hand (which takes a bit longer). 
 Sprinkle some  flour  on top and cover: let rise for 30 minutes. 
 Mix the filling ingredients together. 
 Lightly  flour  the baking board and turn the dough on it. 
 Roll dough out to a 40 x 60 cm square. 
 Spread the filling on the dough and roll it up tightly, starting from the longer side of the square. 
 Cut the roll in 3–4 cm pieces. 
 "open" the pieces by pressing the centre of each piece with a handle of a knife so that the centre is pressed down and the sides spread. 
 Place rolls on a parchmented baking sheet, cover and let rise for 30 minutes. 
 Brush the rolls with beaten  egg . 
 Bake at 225°C for about 10 minutes. 
 Cover the rolls while cooling.
