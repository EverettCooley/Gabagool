Description : 
 A Khoreshe is a type of thickened sauce, usually containing meat and vegetables, that is served over  rice . This is one of my favorite Persian dishes, one I used to make for my friend Said. It is Persian home-style cooking at its best! 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  eggplant 
 olive oil 
 2 large  onions , sliced 
 2 lbs boneless  lamb , cut into 1 inch cubes 
 3 large  tomatoes , peeled and chopped 
 2 tablespoons fresh  lemon juice 
 1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon ground  nutmeg 
 fresh ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Slice the unpeeled  eggplant  and sprinkle with  salt ; place in a colander to drain for 25-30 minutes. 
 Pat  eggplant  dry and set aside. 
 Heat 2 tbsp  olive oil  in large saute pan; sauté eggplant until tender. 
 Add a little  oil  as needed to prevent sticking. 
 In large kettle, heat 2 tbsp. 
 olive oil ; add  onions  and sauté until tender. 
 Add  lamb  cubes,  browning  on all sides. 
 Lower heat and simmer for 20 minutes, then add  eggplant ,  tomatoes ,  lemon juice ,  cinnamon , and  nutmeg . 
 Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper ; add ½ cup  water . 
 Simmer for 1 hour, or until meat is tender. 
 Serve over  chelo , or steamed  basmati rice . 
 Lemon  wedges also make a good condiment.
