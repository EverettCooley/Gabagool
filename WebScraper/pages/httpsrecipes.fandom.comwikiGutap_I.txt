 Prepare and cut the dough into 48 squares, following the directions for  Samsa .

 Draw up the corners of the squares and pinch the corners firmly together, enclosing the filling.

 Remove them from the  oil  with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels while you fry and drain the remaining fritters similarly. 
 Serve at once, as an accompaniment to cocktails or tea.
