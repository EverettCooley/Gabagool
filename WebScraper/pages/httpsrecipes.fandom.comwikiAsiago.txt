 About Asiago : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Asiago on Wikipedia 
 Asiago is a hard, aromatic Italian cheese with a crumbly texture, whose flavor is only reminiscent of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. It is often used in salads, soups, pastas, and sauces.
 It was originally made only in the Dolomite Mountains region of northern Italy, near the town of Asiago. It can get used for grating and as a table cheese. This cheese is granular, usually like Parmesan, but a bit more pungent in flavor. An American-made asiago is also available.
 It is among the best substitutes for Parmigiano-Reggiano.
