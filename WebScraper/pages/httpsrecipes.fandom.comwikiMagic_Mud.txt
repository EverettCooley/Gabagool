 5 tbsp  cornstarch 
 3 tbsp  water 
 food coloring 
 Measuring spoon 
 Mug 
 Spoon 
 Directions : 
 Spoon  cornstarch  into mug. 
 Add  water  and stir. It should be difficult to stir, even when  water  and  cornstarch  are fully mixed. 
 Color your magic mud. 
 Don't add too much  food coloring  or your mud will become runny. If this happens, add a little  cornstarch  until the mud feels like it did before adding the  food coloring . 
 Squeeze a small quantity of magic mud between your fingers and roll it into a ball or sausage. 
 What happens? Try it again.
