 Description : 
 This is a recipe I wrote in 1994. I had these ingredients on hand and put it together. It is a fabulous appetizer and one I serve at a lot of my catering events. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 16 fresh  asparagus  spears trimmed 
 3 tablespoons Dijon  mustard 
 16 thin slices smoked  Ham 
 16 slices  Swiss cheese 
 2  eggs  beaten 
 1 cup Italian dry bread crumbs 
 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a skillet cook  asparagus  in a small amount of  water  until crisp-tender and drain well. 
 Spread about 1 teaspoon of  mustard  on each  Ham  slice. 
 Top with one slice of  Cheese . 
 Place an  asparagus  spear at one end. 
 Roll up each  Ham  sliced tightly, secure with three toothpicks. 
 Dip  Ham  roll in  egg  then roll in breadcrumbs. 
 Fry rolls in  oil  a few at a time, until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. 
 Drain on paper towels; keep warm. 
 Cut each roll between the toothpicks into three pieces.
