 Description : 
 A delicious snack. For the vegetarians, you can use  potatoes  only.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For filing:
 
 50 g minced  Chicken  or  Beef 
 1 large  Onion , diced 
 2 tbsp  curry  powder, added to 2 tbsp  water  to make a paste 
 2  potatoes , boiled and diced 
 2 tbsp  oil 
 1/4 cup of  coconut milk 
 salt  to taste 
 For pastry:
 
 2 cups of  flour 
 4 tbsp  margarine / butter 
 1/2 tsp  baking powder 
 1  egg , lightly beaten 
 enough cold  water  to make a soft dough 
 1/4 tsp  salt 
 oil  for deep frying 
 Directions : 
 Make filing ahead of time. Put  oil  in pan. Fry diced  onions  until soft. Add  curry  powder paste and fry until fragrant. Add minced meat,  potatoes ,  coconut milk  and  salt . Cook over low heat until meat is cooked and the mixture is dry. Remove from heat and drain from  oil . Allow to cool before using. 
 To make pastry: Sift  flour ,  baking powder  and  salt  into a bowl. Add  margarine / butter  and work lightly into  flour  with fingers until mixture is crumbly. Add beaten  egg  and  water  to form a soft dough. Knead for a few minutes. 
 Break off 1/2 the dough and toll out on a floured board to thickness of half an inch. Cut into round shapes with a small glass and remove them onto a floured plate. Roll each circle into required size and thickness - fill each of them with the filling, allowing enough space to fold the pastry over and seal the edges with a fork. In the meantime, heat enough  oil  in a wok and deep fry the pastry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve.
