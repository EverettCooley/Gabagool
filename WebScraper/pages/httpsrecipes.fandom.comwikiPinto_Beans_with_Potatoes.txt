Description : 
 This dish traditionally is made with  manioc  (also known as  cassava ), but  potatoes  are a reasonable substitute.
 
 Serves 6 â€“ 8. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups dried  pinto beans , pre-soaked 
 3 large  potatoes , chopped 
 2  celery  stalks, chopped 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1  onion , thinly sliced 
 4 tbsp (80 ml)  peanut oil 
 Directions : 
 Cover the  pinto beans  with  water , bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until beans are just tender. 
 Add the  potato  chunks,  celery  and  salt , along with more  water  if necessary to cover. 
 Continue to cook over low heat. 
 Just before the  potatoes  and beans are tender, gently fry the  onion  in  oil  in a large, heavy skillet or stew pot. 
 Using a slotted spoon, add the beans and  potatoes  to the pot, and stir until well mixed and heated through. 
 Serve hot over  rice  or a stiff porridge.
