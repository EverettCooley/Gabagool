 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can  sweetened condensed milk 
 2  egg  yolks 
 1 tbsp  butter  or  margarine 
 1Â lb freshly  grated coconut 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients well. 
 Cook in heavy saucepan, stirring constantly, until you can see the bottom of the pan (same method as for Brigadiers). 
 Pour onto a plate and let cool completely. 
 I usually wait until the next day to form the balls. 
 Lightly grease the palm of your hands and form small balls. 
 Roll them in  Sugar  and put in pretty paper cups.
