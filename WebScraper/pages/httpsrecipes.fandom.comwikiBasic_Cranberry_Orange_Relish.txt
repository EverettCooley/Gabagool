 1 large  orange 
 3/4 cup  Sugar

 Wash the fresh  cranberries  in a large bowl or pan of  water , sorting out any squishy or moldy ones (if frozen, just use as is). 
 Place half the  cranberries  in a food processor. 
 Process until chopped about the size of coarse pickle relish. 
 Place in a bowl. Process the rest of the  cranberries . 
 Place half the  oranges  in food processor and proceed as above, mixing the chopped  orange  and peel into the  cranberries . 
 Add the  Sugar . Stir well. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight to chill, and so the best flavor can develop. 
 
If you prefer a jelled relish, use 1 package of  unflavored gelatin . Sprinkle  gelatin  in 1/4 cup of  water  and let it soften. Heat in the microwave until dissolved. Add to the relish along with 1/2 cup of  orange juice .
