Ingredients 
 2/3 cup  flour 
 1/3 cup  whole wheat flour 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 2 teaspoons  baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt 
 3/4 cup skim milk 
 1  egg 
 2 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 1 1/3 cup  corn  kernels (frozen, canned or fresh) 
 Directions 
 In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the five dry ingredients. 
 In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil. Stir in the corn, and add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing them just to blend. The mixture will be lumpy. 
 For each pancake, spread 1/4 cup of batter on a hot, greased griddle. Cook the pancakes over moderate heat until they are golden brown on the bottom and the tops begin to bubble. Then flip them over, and cook them until the undersides are golden brown.
