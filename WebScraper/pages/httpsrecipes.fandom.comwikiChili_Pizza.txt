 Nutrition
 
 1 premade pizza dough 
 2 cups chili 
 3 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese 
 toppings of your choice
 olives 
 scallions 
 onion 
 tomatoes 
 sour cream 
 guacamole 
 Directions : 
 Roll out pizza dough onto a pizza stone or an aluminum pan if you don't have a stone. 
 Spread chili on top of dough as you would sauce in regular pizza. 
 Top with Cheese. 
 Place in 425 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until crust browns and cheese it bubbly. 
 Place all toppings in bowls on table, slice pizza and serve with toppings. 
 Notes : 
 Everyone adds what they like to the top and mmm. If you like you can also bake with the toppings already on the pizza but we like the fun of putting them on after. 
 I hope you enjoy!
