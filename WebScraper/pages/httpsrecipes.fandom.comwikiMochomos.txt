Description : 
 Mochomos , shredded pork Chihuahua-style. Serves 6 to 8. Can be eaten as-is or used as a taco filling.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds boneless  pork  shoulder (1 inch pieces) 
 2 cups water 
 1 small white or yellow  onion , quartered 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2 cups  guacamole 
 1  tomato , thinly sliced 
 1 handful of shredded  lettuce 
 Directions : 
 Bring meat, water, onion and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Lower heat, cover and let simmer until meat is very tender, 1 hour typical. 
 Uncover and set heat to high, boil until most of the water has evaporated. Watch the meat closely and stir so it doesn't and burn. 
 Using two forks shred the meat. Make sure no large chunks remain.

 Create a mound of the meat mixture on a plate and surround with guacamole.
