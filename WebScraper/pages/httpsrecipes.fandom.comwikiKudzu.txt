Kudzu, has been a popular food in Japan and China for thousands of years. Most of the plant can be eaten -- the tender leaves and stems can be cooked as with other Greens. However, it's the tuberous roots that offer this plant's real premium. These roots are dehydrated and pulverized, and it is this starchy kudzu powder that is used for cooking in myriad ways -- from thickening soups and sauces to Dredging foods to be deep-fried. It's high in fiber, protein and vitamins A and D.
