Description : 
 When you've had your fill of  cherries  for their short season but dream of more later, suspending them in an anisey syrup of  ouzo  and  sugar  is a way to keep them, stored in the refrigerator, halfway to next year's  cherry  season. Use them as a topping for pancakes or  ice cream , as a side sauce for chocolate  ancho chile  steamed pudding cake, or spooned directly out of the jar when you'd like a taste of  cherry  in November.  Pernod  or  anisette  will do as a substitute for the harder-to-find, and more expensive,  ouzo .

 Preparation: 20 Minutes 
 Makes 3½ to 4 cups 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds  cherries , pitted 
 ½ cup  ouzo 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Combine the ingredients in the pressure cooker and stir to dissolve the sugar a bit. 
 Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 4 minutes. 
 Immediately remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes to finish cooking. 
 With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. 
 Remove the lid. 
 If too moist, boil until the liquid is thickened and syrupy but still pourable, 2 to 3 minutes. 
 Refrigerate overnight, covered, before using.
