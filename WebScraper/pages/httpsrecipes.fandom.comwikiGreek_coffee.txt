About Greek coffee : 
       Greek coffee     A rich, intensely strong brew made by boiling finely ground  coffee  and water together in a long-handled, open, brass or copper pot called an ibrik. Sugar and spices are sometimes added to the grounds before brewing begins. Greek coffee is often brought to a boil three times before it's considered ready. It is poured directly into tiny  demitasse  cups, which means that each cup gets its share of fine coffee grounds. Let the coffee sit for a few moments to allow the sediment to settle.
