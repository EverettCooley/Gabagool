 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1  red onion , finely chopped 
 1 cup chopped  mint 
 250 grams  Chicken  breast, cut into small dice 
 1  egg , lightly beaten 
 250 grams  Pork  mince 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  cumin  seeds, toasted 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 2 tablespoons  sesame seeds , toasted 
 70 grams  walnuts , roasted and chopped 
 60 grams moist  figs , chopped 
 ½ preserved  lime , flesh removed and skin finely chopped or zest of 1 large  lemon 
 10 slices of streaky  Bacon 
 Directions : 
 1) Preheat oven to 180 °C.
 2) Heat the  oil  in a small sauté pan and gently cook the  Onion  with a pinch of  salt  until very soft. Set aside to cool.
 3) Place all the ingredients including the cooled  Onion  in a large bowl, and mix until well combined.
 4) Line a terrine or other deep, oven proof dish with the  Bacon , allowing the excess to hang over the sides. Pack the mixture into the dish and fold the  Bacon  over the top to cover the terrine completely. Place the lid on top or cover well with a double thickness of tin foil.
 5) Put the terrine in a deep baking dish and add enough boiling  water  to come halfway up the sides of the terrine.
 6) Cook for 1 hour then test to see if the juices run clear or the internal temperature is 70 °C when tested with a meat thermometer.
 7) Remove the terrine from the  water  bath, place a weight on top and allow to cool.
 8) Cover and refrigerate overnight. Serve with crusty bread, cornichons and beetroot relish.
