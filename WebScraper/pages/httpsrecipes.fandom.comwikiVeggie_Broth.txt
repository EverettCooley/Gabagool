Description : 
 Vegetable stock. The great thing about this, is the recipe really doesn't matter, just the main principles. Use whatever veggies you've got and like (or get rid of some you don't). The roasting and the  apple  (or  pear ) seem to be key. The rest is pure invention.
 
 Ingredients : 
 onions 
 leeks 
 carrots 
 celerys 
 apples  (or  pears ) 
 garlic 
 mushrooms 
 ginger 
 lemon grass  (optional) 
 peelings and tired old vegetables 
 parsley 
 peppercorns 
 fresh or dried herbs ( thyme ,  dill ,  allspice ) 
 water  to cover by two inches 
 Directions : 
 Cut in big chunks (maybe quarters) a couple  onions ,  leeks , several  carrots , some  celery  ribs and an  apple . 
 Toss them with several cloves of  garlic , some  mushrooms  (old, shriveled ones are the best), a few slices of  fresh ginger  (peel and all),  lemon grass  is good if you have it and a couple sprays of PAM. 
 Roast all this is 500°F oven for about 20 minutes until very brown (this kind of caramelizes them, and they develop a sweetness). 
 After roasting, put them in a stockpot, and add all the peelings and trimmings you've saved up. 
 Plus any veggies you've had around long enough they're beginning to look a little tired (or fresh ones, too!) 
 A bunch of parsley is nice, peppercorns, sprigs of dried or fresh herbs ( thyme  is especially good), maybe some  dill seeds , a couple of whole  allspices , and enough  water  to cover everything by 2 inches. 
 Bring to a boil, simmer for 20-30 minutes (I've let it go a lot longer, too), fish out the veggies, strain, and you have great stock for soup, sautéing, cooking  pasta  or  rice  and whatever else.
