 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large broiler  Chicken , cut into pieces 
 ½ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 Juice from 2 large  lemons 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 6 cups  chicken broth  or  water 
 ½ cup uncooked  long-grain rice 
 3  tomatoes , peeled and chopped 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper  and 
 
 1 teaspoon  ground turmeric 
 1 can  tomato  paste 
 2 cups sliced  okra , fresh or frozen* 
 1 large  Onion , peeled, chopped and browned in a little  oil 
 Directions : 
 Rub pieces of  Chicken  with juice from  lemons . You can remove skin from the pieces if you prefer less fat. Put the pieces in a covered container in the refrigerator to marinate for no more than 30 minutes. 
 While  Chicken  is marinating, saute the  Onion  in a little  oil  to make the flavor milder. Set aside. 
 Remove the  Chicken  from the refrigerator. Place the  Chicken  in a large kettle with the  chicken broth  or  water . Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cook slowly, covered, for 12 minutes. 
 Add  onions ,  tomatoes ,  tomato  paste,  rice , spices and  salt  and  pepper . Cook for 30 minutes, until the  Chicken  and  rice  are tender. 
 Remove  Chicken  pieces and debone as soon as they are cool enough to handle. Return the  Chicken  to the kettle (along with the sliced  okra  if you waited) and stir until everything is well mixed (and the  okra  is tender). Serve over additional  rice , with some fresh fruit for dessert.
