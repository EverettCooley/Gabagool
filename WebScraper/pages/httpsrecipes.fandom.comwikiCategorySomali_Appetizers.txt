 Appetizers are served in Somalia during Ramadan, weddings, parties and other special occasions.
 Sambusa is one of the most well-known Somali appetizers. To make it you put onions, leek and garlic in a large skillet where you had previously heated olive oil. Add ground beef, and cook until about halfway done. You can season with cumin, cardamom, salt and pepper. In a small dish or cup, mix together the flour and water to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. Fill the cone with the meat mixture, close the top, and seal with the paste. Fry the Sambusa a few at a time until golden brown in a deep-fryer or deep heavy pot at 365 degrees F. 
Dabo Kolo is another Somali recipe for a delicious appetizer. Its main ingredients are wheat flour, beriberi spice mix, softened butter, sugar, salt and water.
 Sorghum and peanuts is an easy to make appetizer. You have to saut√© sorghum in oil, stirring to separate grains. When the grains are separated, lower heat, add stock and peanuts, and seasoning to taste. In the end, cover tightly and simmer for 20 minutes.
