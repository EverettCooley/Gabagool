Cook time: 70 seconds 
 
 Description : 
         
 A quick tasty dessert created in the microwave.  It can come out a bit dry but that's all the more reason to top it with ice cream.
 CAUTION: a large mug or a bowl must be used because the volume of risen cake may overtop an average 12-ounce coffee mug. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 1 ounce square of  unsweetened baker's chocolate 
 2 tablespoons  granulated sugar 
 2 tablespoons  cake flour 
 one quarter  (Â¼)  teaspoon baking powder 
 pinch of salt 
 2 drops of  vanilla extract 
 2 tablespoons  whole milk 
 Directions : 
 Very slowly and carefully soften butter and chocolate together by microwaving for a few seconds at a time.  Heating too quickly will cause chocolate to burn.  Chocolate does not need to reach a completely liquid state. 
 Add dry ingredients and mix using a fork or wire whisk until a crumbly consistency is achieved. 
 Add milk and vanilla extract and mix well.  Batter will start off thin and grow thicker and more viscous as sugar dissolves. 
 Microwave on maximum setting for 70 seconds in a 1100-watt microwave. 
 Serve and enjoy.
