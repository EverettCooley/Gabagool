 Description : 
 This Japanese sausage dish is made imperial to the taste and topped with nori sheets, wasabi, and mayonnaise, named in honor of the Japanese hot-dog eating champion Takeru Kobayashi. Ranch dressing sometimes replaces mayonnaise and then works for this for drizzling, too.

 8 beef hot dogs, grilled 
 8 whole wheat buns, toasted 
 8 tablespoons mayonnaise, optional 
 8 teaspoons teriyaki sauce 
 1 green onion, thinly sliced 
 8 nori sheets, crumbled 
 Directions : 
 Steam each beef hot dog in a small pan for 5 minutes. 
 Place a hot dog in each bun. Top each with half of the mayonnaise (optional), teriyaki sauce, green onions, and crumbled nori. Serve warm with other side dishes or appetizers
