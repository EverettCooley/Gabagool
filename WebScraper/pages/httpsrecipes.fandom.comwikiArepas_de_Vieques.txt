 Description : 
 Vieques-style fritters
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1/3 cups whole  milk 
 2 oz grated  Cheddar   Cheese 
 2 tablespoonfuls  margarine  or cooking  oil 
 (B)
 
 1 large  egg  at room temperature 
 1 1/2 cups  cornmeal 
 1/2 cup  wheat flour 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt , or to taste 
 1 teaspoon  Sugar  or equivalent substitute such as Equal or Splenda 
 Enough frying  oil 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  Cheese  and  margarine  in the  milk  at medium or medium-low heat. Stir occasionally until the  Cheese  and  margarine  have melted. 
 Add the  egg  and whisk into the mix. 
 Mix together the remaining ingredients in (B). Slowly add them to the mix, whisking frequently to avoid lumping. 
 Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool, or refrigerate until the next day. 
 Blend all ingredients together. 
 Use a ladle to measure out enough mixture to form  flour  patties, which can be anywhere from three to six inches in diameter and about as thick as a loaf of sandwich  bread . 
 Fry in a deep skillet with enough  oil  to assure even cooking on both sides. Remove when color is a light golden tan. Serve while still warm.
