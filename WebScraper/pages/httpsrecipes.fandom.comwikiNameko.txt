Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Nameko

A small Japanese mushroom that ranges in color from orange to amber to gold. The nameko has a soft almost gelatinous texture and a rich, earthy aroma and flavor. It's highly regarded and used primarily in Japanese soups and one-pot dishes. Though nameko mushrooms are seldom found fresh in the United States, they're available canned in Asian markets. The nameko is sometimes also called cinnamon cap.
