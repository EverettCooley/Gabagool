Description : 
 Sofrito is a Spanish  word referring to a culinary combination of aromatic ingredients which have been cut in very small pieces, and slowly (at least a quarter of an hour, but more usually half an hour) sautéed or braised in cooking oil. Within the context of Spanish cuisine, sofrito consists of garlic, onion, and tomatoes cooked in olive oil, and is used as the base for many dishes.
 It is typical of most of the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, and which have since been adapted by the cooking of some Latin American countries due to historical reasons. This is known as refogado in Portuguese-speaking nations, sofregit in Valencian cuisine, and ginisá in Filipino cuisine.
