Description : 
 Coconut curry from the Maldives
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g  coconut  (grated) 
 75 g  fennel seed 
 50 g  cumin 
 150 g  dried chilli peppers 
 25 g  peppercorns 
 50 g  cinnamon 
 50 g  cardamom 
 15 g  cloves 
 20 g  turmeric powder 
 100 g  onion  (sliced) 
 20 g  garlic  (sliced) 
 30 g  ginger  (sliced) 
 6  cherry peppers 
 2 bunches  curry leaf 
 2  rampe leaf 
 Directions : 
 Mix all the ingredients. 
 In a large wok toast the  coconut   curry  mix over a low heat until the  coconut  has turned golden brown. 
 When toasting the ingredients it is necessary to stir the contents at regular intervals to ensure even  browning  of the  coconut . 
 Toasting of the  curry  mix is best done in small quantities at a time as if done in large quantities it may result in the  curry  mix being unevenly toasted. 
 Once toasted, let cool. 
 Dry grind the mixture to a semi-coarse stage. 
 Keep in an airtight container until required. 
 To make coconut curry paste blend the required amount of ground coconut curry mix to a smooth paste. 
 Use as required. 
 This  curry  paste can also be used raw without toasting.
