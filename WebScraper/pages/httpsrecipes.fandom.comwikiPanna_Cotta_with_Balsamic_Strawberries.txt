 Ingredients : 
 ½ packet (1 teaspoon) unflavored  gelatin  powder 
 1½ tablespoons cold water 
 1½ cups  heavy cream , divided 
 1 cup plain whole-milk  yogurt 
 1 teaspoon pure  vanilla extract 
 ½  vanilla bean , split and seeds scraped 
 ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 2 pints (4 cups) sliced fresh  strawberries 
 2½ tablespoons  balsamic vinegar 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 freshly grated  lemon zest , for serving 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin on 1½ tablespoons of cold water. 
 Stir and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the gelatin to dissolve. 
 Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together ¾ cup of the cream, the yogurt, vanilla extract, and vanilla bean seeds. 
 Heat the remaining ¾ cup of cream and the ⅓ cup of sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. 
 Off the heat, add the softened gelatin to the hot cream and stir to dissolve. 
 Pour the hot cream-gelatin mixture into the cold cream-yogurt mixture and stir to combine. 
 Pour into 4 (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins or custard cups and refrigerate uncovered until cold. 
 When the panna cottas are thoroughly chilled, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 
 Combine the strawberries, balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon sugar, and pepper 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving. 
 Set aside at room temperature. 
 To serve, run a small knife around each dessert in the ramkein and dip the bottom of each ramekin quickly in a bowl of hot tap water. 
 Invert each ramekin onto a dessert plate and surround the panna cotta with strawberries. 
 Dust lightly with freshly grated lemon zest and serve.
