Coffee Shop Fudge
From Quick Cooking
 This recipe is one that my son, Jackson, and I worked on together. After
several efforts, we decided this version was a winner. It is smooth,
creamy and has an irresistible crunch from pecans. The coffee and
cinnamon blend nicely to provide subtle flavor. -Beth Osborne Skinner,
