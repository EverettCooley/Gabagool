 Ingredients : 
 5 large  artichokes 
 5 teaspoons  rice  washed and drained 
 1 small  onion  chopped 
 2 tablespoon  dill  chopped 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 ¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 1½ cups hot water 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 Trim base of the stem then break off all dark leaves and throw them away. 
 Scoop out the light green leaves and choke with teaspoon and discard, then rub with lemon. 
 Clean off the bottom part with a knife. 
 Leave in the water and lemon juice mixture to prevent discolouration. 
 Saute onion with olive oil in a pot. 
 Add rice, salt and sugar then cook for a few minutes over medium heat. 
 Pour ¾ cup of hot water in it then stir and put the lid on. 
 Turn the heat down to low then cook until rice is soft then add dill and toss. 
 Place artichokes in a shallow pan and fill with rice equally. 
 Pour ¾ cup of hot water into the pan from the side then cover the lid. 
 Cook until artichokes are fork tender over medium low heat. 
 If necessary add little by little more hot water. 
 Arrange them on a service plate then pour remaining half of the olive oil over and sprinkle some chopped dill on top. 
 Serve cold.
