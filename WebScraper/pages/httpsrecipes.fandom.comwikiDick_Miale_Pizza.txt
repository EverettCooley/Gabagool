Description : 
 Most rustic types of bread consist of just  flour ,  yeast ,  water  and  salt . I usually vary mine using a  cracked wheat  and also  semolina   flour . It seems to give the bread character. When I was under a neurosurgeon, we were talking about sugars in the American diet and he said in Iran, the bread was made with out any sugars. I don't use a bread machine either. I bake mine on unglazed quarry tiles and throw  ice cubes  in the bottom when i put the bread in. Gives it a nice rustic flavor and appearance. Sunday I made pizza using the following ingredients (no fats-no  sugar ):
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups unbleached white  flour 
 2 cups  cracked wheat   flour 
 2 pkgs  yeast 
 2 cups  water 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Make the dough using the ingredients above. 
 put veggies on the top, using fresh  tomatoes . 
 It made to large rounds. 
 Again the only fat was the PAM on the bottom and PAM on the top plus 1 tbsp grated  cheese  for both pizzas. 
 Worked out to be about Â½ veggie and 2 bread for 2 slices. 
 Tasted a heck of a lot better than some of the commercial pizzas.
