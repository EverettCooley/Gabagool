 About Meringue powder : 
 A powder that is used for producing meringue, which is a topping used for pies and various other desserts. The powder is made from dried egg whites blended with sugar and gum. When water is added to the powder and is whipped, meringue topping is created. Like all other uncooked egg products, meringue powder is pasteurized so it is very useful when preparing dishes requiring uncooked meringues. It also has a long shelf life (over one year).
