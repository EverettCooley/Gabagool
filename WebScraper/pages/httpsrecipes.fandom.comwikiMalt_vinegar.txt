 About Malt vinegar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Malt vinegar on Wikipedia 
 Malt vinegar is made by malting barley, causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. An ale is then brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged. A cheaper alternative, called 'non-brewed condiment', is a solution of 4 – 8% acetic acid colored with caramel. There is also around 1 – 3% citric acid present.
 Australians, British, Americans and Canadians commonly use malt vinegar on fish and chips.
