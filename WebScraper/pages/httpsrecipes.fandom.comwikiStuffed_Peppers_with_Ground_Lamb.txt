Ingredients : 
 4 medium  green bell peppers 
 ½ pound lean  ground lamb 
 ¼ cup chopped  onion 
 1 cup cooked  brown  or  white rice 
 1 x 8-ounce can  tomato sauce 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon dried  oregano 
 ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Prepare an 8-inch square or round baking dish with non-stick pan spray. 
 Cut a thin slice from the stem end of each pepper. 
 Remove all the seeds and membranes. 
 Partially cook the peppers in a large pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. 
 Drain and set aside. 
 In a large non-stick skillet, saute the ground lamb and the onion over medium-high heat about 5 minutes, until the lamb is browned and the onion is tender; drain off the fat. 
 Stir in the rice, ½ cup of the tomato sauce, the garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper. 
 Divide the mixture evenly to fill the peppers. 
 Stand the peppers upright in the prepared baking dish and top them with the remaining tomato sauce. 
 Cover the peppers with foil and bake for 40 minutes; uncover and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
