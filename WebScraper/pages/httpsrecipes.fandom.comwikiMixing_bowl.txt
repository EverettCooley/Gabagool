Sets or individual bowls of varying sizes that are used for combining food ingredients when preparing recipes. Mixing bowls are made of plastic, ceramic, glass, copper, and stainless steel that range in size from 4 inches in diameter to over 16" in diameter. Common bowl sizes available include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 quart bowls, however there are a wide variety of sets with different sizes available. Some bowls will have formed handles while others will be smooth around the surface without any type of attached or formed handle. When selecting bowls, look for sizes that will easily hold amounts sufficient for the type of recipes commonly prepared. Make sure the bowls purchased have markings on the side to indicate amounts, such as 2, 4 or 6 quart levels.
