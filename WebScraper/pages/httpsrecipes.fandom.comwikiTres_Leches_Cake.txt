Description 
 This is easy to prepare and takes maximum 40 minutes. It serves about 12 people.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Cake : 
 9  eggs  (room temperature) 
 1 1/2cups of  Sugar 
 12 tablespoons of  butter  (softened) 
 2 cups of  all-purpose flour 
 1 1/2teaspoons of  baking powder 
 1 cup of  milk 
 1 teaspoon of  vanilla extract 
 1 teaspoon of  cream of tartar 
 Three milks : 
 2 cups of  heavy cream 
 1 five-ounce can (5/8cup) of  evaporated milk 
 1 14-ounce can of  Sweetened condensed milk 
 Icing : 
 2 cups heavy cream 
 1/3cup sugar 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
 Separate egg yolks and whites, keeping whites at room temperature. 
 In bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy. 
 Add egg yolks and beat until fluffy again, 2 to 3 minutes on medium-high speed. 
 In a separate bowl combine flour and baking powder. 
 In a third bowl mix milk and vanilla 
 Alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture to the butter mixture (a fourth at a time) until all are combined. 
 Beat until smooth after each addition. 
 Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form and, using a large spatula, gently but thoroughly fold into batter. 
 Grease bottom of a 9- by 13-inch metal baking pan. 
 Pour in batter and bake for approximately 25 minutes, until golden brown. 
 Allow to cool. (May also be baked in an 11.5- by 17.5-inch sheet pan for 20 minutes; this size rises very evenly, helpful for inexperienced cooks.) 
 Milk : 
 Stir the three milks together thoroughly; do not beat. Do not refrigerate canned milks before using. 
 Icing : 
 Whip cream sugar together until stiff. 
 When cake is cool, slice or peel off the thin top crust. 
 Ice the sides first, creating a small lip on top to catch the milk mixture. 
 Pour milk mixture evenly over top of cake (if necessary, poke holes in cake with a knife or toothpick to facilitate soaking; you will probably need only 3/4ths of mixture). 
 Finish icing top. 
 Refrigerate.
