 Wikipedia Article  About Almond milk on Wikipedia 
 Almond milk is a milky drink made from ground almonds, not unlike soy milk or rice milk. Usually unlike animal milk, almond milk contains no cholesterol or lactose and can be used as a substitute for animal milk in many recipes.
 Historically, almond milk was consumed over a region stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to East Asia. In the Middle Ages, almond milk was known in both the Islamic world and Christendom, where its vegan composition made it suitable for consumption during Lent. The Viandier by Taillevent, a 14th-century cookbook by the chef to the French kings Charles V and Charles VI, contains a recipe for almond milk. Before the influx of Mainland Chinese after the Chinese Civil War, almond milk was more commonplace in Taiwan than soy milk.
 Commercial almond milk products come in plain, vanilla, or chocolate flavours. They are often enriched with vitamins.

Historically, almond milk was also called amygdalate.       Almond Milk
