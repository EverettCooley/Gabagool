Description : 
 Every year during the winter holiday season, I enjoy making dishes to celebrate the holiday traditions. One my favorite dishes for these occasions when I was growing up was Chicken liver pâté. In our family recipe for chopped liver, butter is the secret ingredient that makes this pâté creamy, rich, and really delicious.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 1  onion , chopped 
 1 pound  chicken livers 
 3 hard-boiled  eggs 
 2 sticks of  butter 
 Salt  to taste 
 Bread, such as  baguette , sliced 
 Directions : 
 Heat oil in a skillet. 
 Add onions and fry until they turn golden. 
 Meanwhile, cook livers in boiling water for about 10-15 minutes. Drain and cool. 
 In a food processor, mix onions, livers, eggs, and butter until mixture is smooth. 
 Season with salt to taste. 
 Refrigerate for couple of hours before serving. 
 Spread a thin layer on fresh or toasted bread slices.
