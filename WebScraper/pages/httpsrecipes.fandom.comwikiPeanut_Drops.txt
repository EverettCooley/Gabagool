 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cup roasted  peanuts 
 5 tablespoons minced or shredded  ginger 
 3 cups dark unprocessed  sugar 
 1 cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Combine the  peanuts  and  ginger . 
 Place in a deep pot with the  Sugar  and  water . 
 Put stove on high and boil. 
 Boil until  water  is gone and the  Sugar  is like carmel and sticky. 
 Place a sheet of greased paper on a flat surface (kitchen counter) close by. 
 Stir the mixture in the pot with a large spoon to be sure it does not stick to the 
 bottom. Use the spoon to scoop out mixture to create 1-1/4-inch wide mounds on the
greased paper. Each 1-1/4-inch wide mound should be placed in a separate heap on the greased
paper. Let the drops cool and harden.
