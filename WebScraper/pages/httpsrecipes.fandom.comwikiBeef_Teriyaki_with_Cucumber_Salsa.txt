      Beef Teriyaki with Cucumber Salsa     
 Ingredients : 
 2 Scotch  steak  fillet 
 Marinade : 
 40 ml  soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons  sherry  wine 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1 teaspoon grated fresh  ginger  (I have used jarred) 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 Salsa : 
 1 large  Lebanese cucumbers , seeded 
 ½  red capsicum  ( bell pepper ) 
 2  spring onions 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 1 tablespoon  rice wine vinegar 
 ½  lemon , juice of 
 2 teaspoons roasted  sesame seeds  (for garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Combine ingredients for marinade. 
 Immerse  steak  in marinade, turning to coat. 
 Refrigerate at least half an hour. 
 Peel  cucumber  and dice into 1cm cubes. 
 Slice capscicum into strips and then across ways to be about the same size as the  cucumber . 
 Slice spring  onions  on the diagonal (make sure you use some of the green bit) *combine in a salad bowl. 
 In a small saucepan, combine the  sugar ,  vinegar  and 2 tbs  water . 
 Boil, stirring until the  sugar  has dissolved, and them simmer for 2 minutes, or until it has thickened slightly. 
 Squeeze in the  lemon juice . 
 Allow to cool for a few minutes, and then poor directly over the salsa. 
 Cook the meat to your liking. Retain the marinade. I use the gluten-free and have it rare. 
 Allow it to rest at least 10 minutes. 
 Slice the  steak  into thin strips, retaining the shape of the  steak . 
 Boil the marinade for 3 minutes to remove any bacteria. 
 Keep warm until serving. 
 Serve the  steak  on a bed of plain  rice . 
 Top with some reserved marinade, and the salsa and finally with the  sesame seeds .
