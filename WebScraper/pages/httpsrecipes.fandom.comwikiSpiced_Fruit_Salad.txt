 225 gm tinned  pineapple  chunks 
 225 gm tinned  peach  chunks 
 225 gm tinned  mango  slices, cut into chunks 
 225 gm tinned  guava  halves, cut into chunks 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 2 black cardamoms 
 3 cloves 4  black peppercorns 
 Directions :

 Uncover and reduce the syrup to half its original volume by boiling for about five minutes.

 Keep the pan covered until the syrup is cool (in an open pan some of the flavour will be lost).

 Arrange the remaining fruits in a serving bowl. 
 Arrange the mangoes on top, then put in the reserved  peach  and  guava . 
 Strain the spiced syrup and pour over the fruits. 
 Cover with cling film and chill. 
 For a variation, use fresh ripe  Pear  instead of tinned  mango . 
 Can also add one tbsp  brandy  to the syrup.
