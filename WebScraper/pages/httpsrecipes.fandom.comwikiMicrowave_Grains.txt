Ingredients : 
 ⅓ each  brown rice 
 ⅓ each  barley 
 ⅓ each  millet 
 Directions : 
 I was bored with  rice , so I mixed ⅓  brown rice , ⅓  barley , and ⅓  millet . 
 Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on high, and let it stand for a few hours (I just put it in a big plastic bowl, and I didn't measure the  water ). 
 It was yummy underneath  chili , beans, and  spaghetti sauce  (3 different meals).
