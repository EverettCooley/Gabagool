 Active time: 10 minutes | Total time: 40 minutes 
 Makes ½ cup, for 6 appetizer servings 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup pitted briny  green olives 
 ¼ cup Marcona almonds or other  almonds , toasted  [1] 
 1 teaspoon fresh  tarragon  or ½ teaspoon dried 
 1 teaspoon  lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Combine olives, almonds, tarragon and lemon juice in a food processor. 
 Pulse until roughly chopped. 
 Add oil in a steady stream and process just until the oil is absorbed (alternatively, finely chop the olives, almonds and tarragon by hand and combine with lemon juice and oil in a medium bowl) the spread should have a coarse but easily spoonable texture. 
 Let stand for about 30 minutes for the flavor to develop. 
 Make ahead tip: cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Spanish Marcona almonds have recently become more popular and more available. They're a little flatter than ordinary almonds, with a richer flavor. Always skinned, most Marcona almonds have already been sautéed in oil and lightly salted when you get them. To toast almonds, spread on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F, stirring once, until fragrant, 7 to 9 minutes.
