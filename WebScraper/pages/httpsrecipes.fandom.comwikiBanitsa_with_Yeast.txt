Ingredients : 
 1½ teaspoons  dry yeast 
 ½ teaspoon  sugar 
 ¼ cup lukewarm  water 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 3 cups  all purpose flour 
 1 cup lukewarm  water 
 1 cup melted  butter 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve ½ tsp  sugar  in ¼ cup lukewarm  water . 
 Sprinkle  yeast  over it and let stand for about 10 minutes. 
 Sift  flour  in bowl and make a well. 
 Add  salt  and  yeast  mixture. 
 Then add 1 cup lukewarm  water  and start mixing to form a dough. 
 Knead, adding more  flour  until dough is soft, but not sticky. 
 Cut into 9 sections and roll into balls. 
 Let stand a few minutes. 
 Take each ball and roll out until the size of a pie plate about 9 inches. 
 Make into piles of three, brushing each circle with melted  butter . 
 You will have three piles with 3 circles in each pile brushed with melted  butter  except for the top circle. 
 Take one circle and roll out on table. 
 Stretch it as much as you can. 
 The edge of the circle should be thin as the rest of the circle. 
 Brush with melted  butter . 
 Take ⅓ of your prepared filling and spread along bottom edge of your circle and spread along one side. 
 Roll up, cut in half lengthwise, seal each end with your fingers and place on a buttered baking pan. 
 Repeat with the remaining circles. 
 This will make 6 strips of pastry. 
 Brush strips with  butter . 
 Let rise for about ½ hour and bake in a preheated oven for 350°F for about ½ hour until done.
