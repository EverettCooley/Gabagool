      Chocolate chip cookies     
       Several types of cookies     
 A  cookie  is a sweet, portable, flour-based cake. The term  cookie  originated from  koekeje â€”the Dutch word for little cake. It is believed that the earliest cookies date back to 7th century Persia.
 There are six basic types of cookies:
 
 Drop cookies  - made from spoonfuls of dough which are dropped onto a baking sheet 
 Bar cookies  - soft dough spooned into a shallow pan which is then baked, cooled and cut into bars 
 Molded cookies  - hand-shaped dough in the form of small balls, logs, crescents or other shaped 
 Pressed cookies  - cookies with fancy shapes and designs made by pressing dough through a  cookie press  (or  pastry bag ) 
 Refrigerator cookies  - made by shaping dough into a log, refrigerating the dough until firm and then slicing and baking it 
 Rolled cookies  - roller-pin flattened dough cut into shapes with  cookie cutters  or a  knife 
 Most cookies are sweet dessert or snack food in individual servings (usually 1-3 cookies in a serving).
 There are other types of cookies, like German  springerle  which are made by imprint designs on dough either with a special  rolling pin  or by pressing the dough through a carved  cookie mold .
 Cookies are eaten on their own as a snack or dessert. When crushed, mixed with melted margarine or butter, and pressed into a pan, they make flavorful crusts for pies. Spicy gingersnaps, rich chocolate wafers, classic vanilla wafers, and whole-grain graham crackers, the varieties most frequently used for crusts, are sold in packages in grocery stores.
