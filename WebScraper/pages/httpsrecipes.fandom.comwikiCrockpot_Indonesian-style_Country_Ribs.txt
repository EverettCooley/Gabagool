Description : 
 Easy to put together in the crock and go. Goes great with steamed  jasmine rice  and fresh  pineapple  and stir-fried veggies cooked with a little bit of the sauce from the ribs (I had some  mushrooms  and  snow peas ). This was inspired by KitchenManiac's recipe #62470 Curry Devil, a dish that I really love and prepare whenever I have the time and ingredients.
 
       Crockpot Indonesian Style Country Ribs     
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs  pork country-style spareribs , trimmed 
 1  onion , sliced 
 ¼ cup ketjap manis (dark sweet  soy sauce ) 
 ¼ cup  pineapple juice 
 1  lime  (juice of, no seeds) 
 2 tablespoons  tomato   ketchup 
 1 tablespoon  brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon grated  fresh ginger 
 ½ teaspoon  ground turmeric 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cayenne pepper 
 To Serve : 
 3 – 4  Thai red chili peppers , slice thin (optional) 
 3 cups steamed  jasmine rice  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Place ribs in the bottom of the crockpot. 
 Separate  onion  into rings and place on top of  pork . 
 In a small bowl, mix together ketjap manis,  pineapple juice ,  lime juice ,  ketchup ,  brown sugar ,  ginger ,  turmeric , and  cayenne pepper  until blended. 
 Pour mixture over  pork  and  onions . 
 Cover crockpot and cook on low for 6–8 hours or on high for 3–4 hours or until  pork  is tender and cooked through. 
 Serve  pork  with  rice  (if desired), garnished with slices of hot chiles. 
 Serving suggestion : 
 For my dinner, I also took some sliced  crimini mushrooms  and  snow peas  (about 2 cups each), and stir-fried those with some hot chilies until they were partly cooked, then added a ladle of the sauce from the crock and allowed it to thicken onto the veggies until the veggies were crisp tender; I served the veggies also with chunks of fresh  pineapple  on the side.
