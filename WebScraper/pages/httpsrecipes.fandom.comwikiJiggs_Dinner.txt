      Traditional Jiggs dinner     
 Description : 
 This very delicious Canadian recipe requires a lot of attention & time but is all worth it ! Newfoundlanders often pour the pot  liquor  (stock) over their dinner. The stock is also thickened for gravy to accompany the roast (moose,  beef , or  chicken ) that is also served at this “scoff”.
