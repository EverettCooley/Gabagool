 Serves : 4 – 6, approx £0.80 per portion 
 Preparation time:  15 minutes 
 Cooking time:  15 minutes 
 Ingredients : 
 450 g lean  pork   o r  turkey  mince, 
 2 tbsp fresh  sage , chopped 
 1 tsp dried  oregano 
 1 tsp dried  thyme 
 zest  of ½  lemon 
 1  egg , beaten 
 4 tbsp  olive oil 
 ½ tsp  allspice   or   cinnamon 
 100 ml cold water 
 2 large  Bramley apples 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 Direction : 
 Mix the pork or turkey mince with the sage, oregano, thyme, lemon zest and season well, then if necessary add a little of the beaten egg to bind together. 
 Mould the mixture into eight patties, about 7cm diameter. 
 Cook the patties in a non-stick frying pan with two tbsp of the olive oil, for 8 - 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Be careful not to let the outsides overcook before the middles are cooked right the way through. 
 Place the other 2 tbsp of oil into a saucepan and heat gently. 
 Add the spice, water and the chopped apples, and cook for 15 minutes until the apples are soft and pulpy and you have a nice thick stew. 
 Finally, season with a little salt and pepper. 
 Serve the patties with the spicy apple stew as a dipping sauce.
