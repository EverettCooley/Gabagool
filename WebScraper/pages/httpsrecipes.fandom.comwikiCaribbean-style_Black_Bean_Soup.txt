Description : 
       Caribbean-style Black Bean Soup     
 This is from the " Fix-It and Forget-It Cookbook " for slow-cookers. I love this, and do my husband and son. Make sure to add the  vinegar  at the end, it makes a big, delicious difference! We like ours with fresh  Cornbread .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb dried  black beans , washed and stones removed 
 3  onions , chopped 
 1  green pepper , chopped 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced (powdered works fine, too) 
 1  ham hock  or ¾ cup cubed  ham 
 1 tablespoon  oil 
 1 tablespoon ground  cumin 
 2 teaspoons dried  oregano 
 1 teaspoon dried  thyme 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 3 cups  water 
 2 tablespoons  vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Soak beans overnight in 4 quarts  water . 
 Drain combine beans,  onions ,  green pepper ,  garlic ,  ham ,  oil ,  cumin ,  oregano ,  thyme ,  salt ,  pepper , and 3 cups fresh  water . 
 Stir well. 
 Cover. 
 Cook on low 8 – 10 hours, or high 4-5 hours. 
 For a thick soup, remove half of cooked bean mixture and puree until smooth in a blender or mash with potato masher. 
 Return to cooker. 
 If you like a soup-ier soup, leave as is. 
 Add  vinegar  and stir well. 
 Debone  ham , cut into bite-sized pieces and return to soup. 
 Serve in soup bowls. 
 Can be topped with  sour cream  and fresh  cilantro .
