 Description : 
 Blood and  barley   sausage , similar to what the English diplomatically call 'black pudding' due to its colour. In Estonia, this is traditional Christmas food, and is served with a red, berry jam.
An older tradition of Estonians was to make white  sausage ; later  blood sausage  became popular. White  sausage  has the same ingredients, except for blood. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1250 g  barley  grouts (wet weight) 
 750 g meat ( bacon ) 
 200 g  onions 
 salt  (according to taste) 
 pepper  (according to taste) 
 marjoram ,  oregano ,  caraway 
 Â½ litre blood 
 about 10 meters bowels 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cook washed grouts into hot salted  water  and boil to half-soft. 
 Cut meat into little pieces and fry it with sliced  Onion  until they are light golden. 
 Add to the grouts and boil until the mixture is soft. 
 Now let the mixture cool and add blood and seasoning. 
 Fill the bowls (intestines) with the mixture but not hard because blood and grouts swell when the sausages boil. Tie the ends of the sausages with soft string. 
 Put the sausages into lukewarm  water  and boil them slowly for about 30 minutes. 
 Cool the ready sausages quickly down and keep them in a cold place. 
 Bake or fry before serving. Before frying, put the sausages into warm  water . 
 Serving : 
 Serve with fried  bacon , cowberry or  cranberry  jam or  pumpkin  salad.
