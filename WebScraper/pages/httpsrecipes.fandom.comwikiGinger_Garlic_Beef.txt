 Serves : 4 
 Ingredients 
 8 oz. lean  top round steak 
 ½ cup low-sodium  beef broth 
 3 tablespoons low-sodium  soy sauce 
 2 ½ teaspoons  cornstarch 
 1 teaspoon  sugar , white only 
 1 teaspoon grated fresh  ginger

 4  green onions , sliced in 1-inch pieces 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil

 Directions 
 Wrap the steak in the cellophane then place in a freezer for about 30 minutes to partially freeze to make it easier to slice. 
 Trim off any extra fat then thinly slice beef into bite-sized pieces with the chef's knife or the butcher knife. 
 In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, ginger, and garlic then set aside. 
 Spray a large skillet or wok with low-fat cooking spray then raise heat to medium-high heat. 
 Add broccoli, mushrooms, and green onions then stir-fry for about 4 minutes or until broccoli is crisp-tender. 
 Remove vegetables from a skillet/wok and set aside. 
 Add beef to the skillet/wok and stir-fry for 3 minutes or until browned on both sides. 
 Stir with the soy sauce mixture then cook until thickened and bubbling. Add vegetables into a skillet and stir together until heated through then serve. Garnish with the fresh cicely, if desired.
