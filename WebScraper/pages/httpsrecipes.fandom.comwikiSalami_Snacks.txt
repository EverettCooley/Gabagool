Description : 
 This silly little recipe came from my husband's family. They would munch on these over late night cocktails. Don't judge 'em 'til you've tried 'em. Everyone says "ewww" when they first read the list of ingredients, even me! But, they are addictive. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 12 slices dry Italian  salami , thin 
 peanut butter  (we prefer chunky) 
 sweet  gherkins  or sour gherkins 
 Directions : 
 Spread  peanut butter  on each slice of salami. 
 Place a gherkin in the center of salami on top of  peanut butter . 
 Fold salami to enclose gherkin. 
 Secure with toothpicks and place on serving plate. 
 Eat!
