 About Bleu de Chèvre : 
 This traditional mountain cheese, a sweet bleu, is very particular as it is made with goat's milk. The summer version has a simple flavour of the milk produced by goats grazing in the mountains and is characterized by a comforting roundness and the faint perfume of the mould.
