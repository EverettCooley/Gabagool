Wildfire spice  is an all-purpose spice mix created by Vic Cherikoff and is made with  mountain pepper ,  lemon aspen ,  lemon myrtle , and  aniseed myrtle . It also includes a few conventional herbs and spices to round out the flavor and make it a highly versatile seasoning. It is not that spicy at all, but it is a rather complex flavoring used in a variety of applications.
