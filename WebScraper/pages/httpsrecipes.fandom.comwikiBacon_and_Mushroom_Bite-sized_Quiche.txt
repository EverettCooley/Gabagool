Description 
 Makes 3½ dozen.
 
 Ingredients 
 8 slices  bacon 
 ¼ pound fresh  mushrooms , chopped 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 ⅓ cup chopped  green onion 
 1⅔ cups shredded  Swiss cheese 
 Pastry for double-crust pie (homemade or purchased) 
 5  eggs 
 1⅔ cups  sour cream 
 Directions 
 Heat oven to 375 °F. 
 On a lightly floured board, roll out the pastry dough 1/16-inch thick. 
 Using a 3-inch cutter, cut out 42 circles; re-roll scraps as needed. Fit circles into bottoms and slightly up sides of lightly greased 2½-inch muffin pans. 
 Meanwhile, fry bacon slices until crisp, drain; crumble or chop. 
 Chop mushrooms, saute in butter until limp and liquid evaporates. 
 Combine bacon, mushrooms, green onion and cheese. Divide filling equally among muffin cups. 
 In large bowl, beat together eggs, add sour cream and stir until smooth. Spoon about 1 tablespoon into each muffin cup. 
 Bake until puffed and light brown, 20 – 25 minutes. Cool in pans 5 minutes; lift out. Serve warm or let cool on wire racks. 
 Note 
 If made ahead, wrap cooled quiches airtight, and refrigerate overnight. Reheat, uncovered, in a 350 °F. oven for about 10 minutes.
