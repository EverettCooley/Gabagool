Description : 
 This recipe is not the real thing but when I'm taking in 1200 calories/day and working out 2 – 3 hours/day training for competitions, I have to watch my calories! To even be able to have cheesecake is a rare treat! This recipe isn't bad at all...and at 155 calories/serving, (⅛ of the cheesecake), I consider it a real treat! It tastes pretty damn good!
