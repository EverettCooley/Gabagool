Serves 4 to 6 
 Cooking time: 3½ hours 
 Ingredients : 
 3 to 5 pounds roasting  pork 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 1 teaspoon powdered  ginger 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 1  onion , finely chopped 
 1 quart  water 
 tomato sauce

 Add  water  and boil slowly for 30 minutes. 
 Cool for 30 minutes and remove  meat , reserving stock for basting. 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Stir  tomato sauce  into stock and empty it into a large baking dish. 
 Place this under the rack at the center of oven. 
 Transfer roast onto the rack so that juices from the meat can drip into the dish underneath. 
 Continue baking at 350°F, allowing 1 hour per pound. 
 Baste constantly with seasoned stock. 
 Cook until  meat  is completely done (when no juice comes out when  meat  is prickled). 
 Gravy underneath  meat  should be sizzling by this time (2½ hours).
