Ingredients : 
 1 x 6 oz package  grape gelatin 
 2 cups purple  grape juice , chilled 
 1 cup  water 
 1 small  carrot 
 4 large  marshmallows 
 1 x 16-oz can unsweetened  pineapple  tidbits 
 1 x 16-oz can  peach  slices (lite recommended) 
 2 cups  green seedless grapes , washed 
 ice  cubes 
 Directions : 
 Put  pineapple  and  peach  slices in a colander to drain (save the juice for another use). 
 Dissolve  gelatin  in 1 cup of boiling  water . 
 When completely dissolved, add 2 cups chilled  grape juice  and 1 cup of  ice  cubes (loosely packed; this will be less than 1 cup of  water  due to spaces in between the cubes). Stir until the  ice  cubes dissolve. 
 Shred the  carrot  finely (don't grate it), and add to the  gelatin . 
 Snip the marshmallows into small pieces and add. 
 Cut  peach  slices into small cubes. 
 If it's not Halloween and you don't need "eyeballs", cut each  grape  in half. Add fruits to  gelatin . 
 Chill. 
 Stir once or twice as it thickens to be sure fruit and  carrot  is evenly distributed. 
 If you use a ring mold, you can put more  grapes  or other fruit in the middle to serve.
