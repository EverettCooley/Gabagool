Ingredients : 
 Cake Batter 
 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 2 cups sugar 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 3 large eggs, lightly beaten 
 1 3/4 cups mashed ripe bananas (about 4 large) 
 1 (8-oz.) can crushed pineapple (do not drain) 
 3/4 cup canola oil 
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 Glaze 
 4 ounces cream cheese, cubed and softened 
 2 cups sifted powdered sugar 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1 to 2 Tbsp. milk 
 How to Make It : 
 Step 1
 Prepare Cake Batter: Preheat oven to 350°. Bake pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan 8 to 10 minutes or until toasted and fragrant, stirring halfway through.
 Step 2
 Stir together flour and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl; stir in eggs and next 4 ingredients, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Sprinkle 1 cup toasted pecans into a greased and floured 14-cup Bundt pan. Spoon batter over pecans.
 Step 3
 Bake at 350° for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes or until a long wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack 15 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack, and cool completely (about 2 hours).
 Step 4
 Prepare Glaze: Process cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and 1 Tbsp. milk in a food processor until well blended. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. milk, 1 tsp. at a time, processing until smooth. Immediately pour glaze over cooled cake, and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup toasted pecans.
