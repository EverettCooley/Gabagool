      I hope you brought a ton of spaghetti in your backpack!     
 I love Kirby... : 
 Yup, I'm the same guy who created the Ultimate Kirby Fanfiction Wiki and the equally infamous silly recipes you find here that have a  ★ on them.
 The ★ indicates the article was made by me! Cuz' my sense of humor spices up (pun intended) my fan-fiction and recipes!
 I created the  Trending Foodie Recipe Archive  where you can add very wacky and wild recipes and post them there. Have you ever heard of birthday cake popcorn?
 
 And Kirby loves food! : 
 Gluten-free chocolate chip muffins 
 Favorite food #2 
 Favorite food #3
