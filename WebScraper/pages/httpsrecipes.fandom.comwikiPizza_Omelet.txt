Ingredients
 
 2 eggs
 
 2 tablespoons milk
 
 1 tablespoon butter
 
 1/4 cup pizza sauce
 
 10 slices pepperoni
 
 1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
 
 1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese
 Directions
 
 In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. In a skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add egg mixture. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.
 
 Spread pizza sauce over half of the eggs; top with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Fold in half; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
