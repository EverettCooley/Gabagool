 About Frangelico : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Frangelico on Wikipedia 
 Frangelico is a hazelnut and herb-flavored liqueur (colored with caramel) which is produced in Canale, Italy. It is 24% alcohol by volume - 48 proof. It was released in the 1980s, gaining attention largely because of its unusual packaging: its bottle was designed to look like a monk, complete with a real knotted white cord around the waist.
 Frangelico is commonly mixed with soda, coffee or espresso. According to Barbero, the manufacturer in Italy, the name of the liqueur is based on a legend of a hermit named Fra Angelico who "created unique recipes for liqueurs."
 Frangelico is made in the same manner as most nut liqueurs: nuts are crumbled up and then left to soak in the base spirit. After the spirit has absorbed the flavor of the nuts, the liqueur is filtered, sweetened, and bottled.
