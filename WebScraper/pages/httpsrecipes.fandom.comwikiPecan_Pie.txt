Info 
 Cook Time : 1 hour 
 Serves : 6-8
 
 Ingredients 
 4  eggs 
 3/4 cup packed  brown sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1 cup  light corn syrup 
 2 tablespoons melted  butter 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla 
 1 1/2 cups  pecan  halves 
 1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust 
 Directions 
 1.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
 2.Beat together eggs, sugar and salt in a large bowl until smooth.
 3.Blend in corn syrup, vanilla and butter until uniform. 
 4.Stir in pecans.
 5.Pour pie filling into shell immediately after adding in pecans.  Note: If using a commercial pie crust (which is slightly smaller in capacity than homemade pie crust), fill shell up just to the edge of the crust. 
 6.Put pie in over and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake for 40â€“50 minutes, until knife inserted halfway between the center and the edge of the pie comes out clean. When the pie is done, the pie filling will be puffed up but will later settle as the pie cools. Let pie cool down before serving.
