Applebee's Mudslide
 2 cups vanilla ice cream
2 oz. Kahlua coffee liqueur
Hershey's chocolate syrup (in a squirt bottle)
Canned whipped cream
 Measure 2 cups ice cream into your blender. Add the Kahlua and blend until smooth. Prepare a 16 oz. wine glass by swirling chocolate syrup around the inside of the glass. Hold the wine glass by the stem and one hand and twirl the wine glass as you squeeze the chocolate. Slowly move the chocolate up toward the rim of the glass so that the chocolate makes a continuous spiral around the inside of the glass. Pour the drink from the blender into the glass. Add a pile of whipped cream to the top of the drink and drizzle additional chocolate syrup over the whipped cream. Add a straw and serve. Makes 1 drink.
