Description : 
       Divinity     
 A fluffy yet creamy candy made with  granulated sugar ,  corn syrup  and stiffly beaten  egg  whites.  nuts ,  chocolate ,  coconut  or various other flavorings are often added to the basic mixture. When  brown sugar  is substituted for  granulated sugar , the candy is called seafoam.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups  sugar 
 ½ cup  light corn syrup 
 ½ cup  water 
 2 large  egg whites  at room temperature 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Avoid making divinity on a humid day; candy will not harden. 
 In a 2 quart saucepan over medium high heat, heat  sugar , syrup and  water  to boiling, stirring until  sugar  is dissolved. 
 Set candy thermometer in place and continue cooking, without stirring until the temperature reaches 248°F. 
 Meanwhile, in a medium bowl with mixer at high speed, beat  egg  whites until stiff peaks form. 
 Beating at medium speed, slowly pour half of the syrup into whites. 
 Continue beating while heating other half of syrup to 272°F. 
 While turning bowl and continuing beating, slowly pour remaining hot syrup into mixture (mixture will be stiff). 
 Don't scrape saucepan; mixture on side may be sugary. 
 Add  vanilla ; beat until mixture holds stiff, glossy peaks. 
 Working quickly, drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper. 
 Completely cool before storing.
