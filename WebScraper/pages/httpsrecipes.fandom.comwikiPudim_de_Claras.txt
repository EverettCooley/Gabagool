 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  Sugar  (for the caramel) 
 5 large  egg  whites 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 1 teaspoon grated  lime  zest 
 Directions : 
 Gradually whisk the  egg  whites until foamy . 
 Increase the speed and add the  Sugar  by spoonfuls. 
 When the meringue forms stiff peaks, fold in the  lime  zest. 
 Use a rubber spatula to gently spoon the meringue into the mold. 
 Bake until the surface is golden brown (about 5 minutes in my oven, which is really hot). 
 Cool and refrigerate, covered, overnight. 
 Just before serving, run the tip of a knife around the inside of the mold. 
 Place a deep platter over the mold and invert: the pudim should slide out easily. 
 If not, give the mold a firm but careful shake. 
 Spoon the caramel sauce on top and serve. 
 Serves about 10.
