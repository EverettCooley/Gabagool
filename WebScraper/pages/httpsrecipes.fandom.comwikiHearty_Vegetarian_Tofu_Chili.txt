 Description : 
 This is a delicious colourful  chili  with a perfect blend of many vegetables with  tofu  in a thick spicy  tomato  base. This original recipe came from Runner's World magazine, although I have altered it to suit my likings. Frying  tofu  gives it a more meat like texture. For those who like  chili  very spicy, more  chili powder  may be added.
