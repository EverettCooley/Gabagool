 Description : 
 This recipe is from Yotam Ottolenghi's vegetarian cookbook "Plenty". It was published in  guardian.co.uk 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ tsp  cumin seeds 
 180 ml light  olive oil  or  vegetable oil 
 2 large  onions , sliced 
 2  red  and 2  yellow peppers , stems and seeds removed, cut into 2 cm strips 
 4 tsp  muscovado sugar 
 2  bay leaves 
 6  thyme  sprigs, picked 
 2 tbsp chopped  parsley 
 2 tbsp chopped  coriander , plus extra to garnish 
 6 ripe  tomatoes , roughly chopped 
 ½ tsp  saffron  threads 
 pinch of  cayenne pepper 
 salt and  black pepper 
 up to 250 ml water 
 8 free-range  eggs 
 Directions : 
 In a very large pan, dry-roast the cumin on high heat for two minutes. 
 Add the oil and onions, sauté for five minutes, add the peppers, sugar and herbs, and cook on a high heat for five to 10 minutes, to get a nice colour. 
 Add the tomatoes, saffron, cayenne and some salt and pepper, and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes. 
 Add water as necessary, so it ends up with a pasta sauce consistency. 
 Taste and adjust the seasoning – it should be pretty potent (you can prepare the dish to this stage well in advance) 
 Remove the bay leaves and divide the mix between four deep frying pans (or one large one), each large enough to take a generous individual portion. 
 Place these on a medium heat to warm up, then make two gaps in the mix in each pan and break an egg into each gap. 
 Sprinkle with salt, cover, and cook on a very gentle heat for 10–12 minutes, until the eggs are just set. 
 Sprinkle with chopped coriander and serve.
