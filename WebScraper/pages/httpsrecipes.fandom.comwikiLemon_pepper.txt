 About Lemon pepper : 
 Lemon pepper (also called lemon pepper seasoning) is a seasoning made from granulated lemon zest and cracked black peppercorns. The lemon zest is mashed with the pepper to allow the citrus oil to infuse into the pepper. This mix is then baked and dried and can be used on meats (particularly chicken) and pasta, although it was originally used primarily for fish. It will also be used in a similar manner to season tofu.
 Lemon pepper is generally commercially available in small jars, although it will also be homemade. Commercially available lemon pepper may also include smaller amounts of other ingredients such as salt, sugar, onion, garlic, citric acid, additional lemon flavor, cayenne pepper, and other spices.
 Purchasing the variety that does not have salt in it allows you to control the amount of salt that gets added to what you are preparing.
