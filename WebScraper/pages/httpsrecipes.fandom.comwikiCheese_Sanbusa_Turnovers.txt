 Description : 
 These tasty turnovers can be filled with a variety of ingredients.

 ¾ cup  oil 
 5 cups white  flour 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 ½-¾ cup cold  water 
 Cheese Filling : 
 1½ lbs  feta  cheese, crumbled 
 ¾ cup fresh herbs, finely chopped ( dill ,  mint ,  chives ,  parsley ,  cilantro ) 
 3 tablespoons  water 
 ¾ teaspoon  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Dough : 
 Melt the  butter  with the  oil . 
 Combine the  flour  and  salt  in a bowl, make a well in the center, and add  oil  and  butter . 
 Stir vigorously until combined, and then add  water  until the dough holds together and comes away from the sides of the bowl. 
 Wrap the ball of dough in plastic and let rest in the refrigerator while preparing the stuffing. 
 Cheese Filling : 
 Place ingredients in the work bowl of a food processor; blend well. 
 Assembling the Sanbusa : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 °F degrees. 
 For each pastry, take a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll it out into a 3-inch circle. 
 Place a teaspoonful of filling in the center of the dough, fold the circle into a half-moon shape and pinch the edges firmly. (Another traditional shape is the triangular pocket, formed by pinching together the edges of the circle in three seams that meet in the center over the filling). 
 Place the pastries on an ungreased baking sheet and bake in the oven for 45 minutes, until golden yellow, or deep fry in  vegetable oil . 
 Serve warm.
