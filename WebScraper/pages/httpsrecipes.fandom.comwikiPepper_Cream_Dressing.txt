 Description : 
 A bold and tangy alternative to the ranch-dressing, this white-hot, robust dip is made with real mayonnaise, sour cream, cheese, fruit juice, and hot pepper sauce and is great for chips, meat, seafood, and vegetables. Italian seasoning sometimes works for this too, while all-purpose cream rarely replaces the mayonnaise.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  mayonnaise   or  (1 cup all-purpose cream) 
 ¼ cup  sour cream 
 ⅓ cup grated Colby, Mozzarella, Cheddar, or  Parmesan cheese 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 ¼ tablespoon  white pepper  or cracked  black pepper 
 ⅛ tablespoon  hot pepper sauce 
 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning, optional 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients especially including Italian seasoning but stir well. 
 Use as dressing for cold  pasta  or a  potato  salad, or as a dip. Spoon or pour contents from the mayonnaise-based dressing into a glass jar but reserve this in the refrigerator.
