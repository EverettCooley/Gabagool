 all you need are  beef  livers 
 Directions : 
 Cut the liver into approximately 1 inch slices. 
 Place in your food dehydrator for 24 hours*. 
 Use pam or the equivalent on the drying racks, so the liver won't stick. 
 Let dry for 24 hours. 
 Or you could place them on a cookie sheet and bake in a 325Â°F oven for about 45 minutes to help dry them out.
