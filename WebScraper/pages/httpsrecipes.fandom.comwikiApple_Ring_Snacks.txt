Description : 
 Why pay for weight watchers  apple  snack when you can make your own? 
 
 From: Vicki Lansky's Candy Book 
 Ingredients : 
 1  apple  (or more) 
 Directions : 
 Peel an  apple  and remove the core. 
 Slice in rings. 
 Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet, or on clear plastic wrap laid out on a cookie sheet. 
 Dry in an electric oven at low or warm temperatures, in a gas oven the pilot light is sufficient. 
 Drying takes 6-9 hours, making this a good overnight project. 
 The size of the  apple  slices and your oven temperature are the variables you will have to experiment with. 
 The  apples  need not be dried to a crisp. 
 Store in an airtight container. 
 These should last several weeks at room temperature. 
 Good for traveling!
