 Ingredients : 
 Dough:
 
 4 1/3 cups  flour 
 1 to 1 1/2 cups  milk 
 2.5 ozs.  yeast 
 1 cup plus 2 tbsp.  margarine  or  butter 
 3/4 cup  Sugar  or honey 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 
Flavoring:
 
 1/2 cup  candied lemon peel 
 1/2 cup chopped  almonds 
 1  lemon , grated for rind 
 1/4 cup  rum 
 1 3/4 cups  Raisins 
 Topping
 
 
 1/4 cup melted  butter 
 1/2 cup  confectioner's sugar 
 Directions : 
 Make a soft, pliable  yeast  dough from ingredients listed in the first section and let stand in bowl for 10 minutes.
 
Knead the spices, except the  Raisins , into the dough. When all other ingredients are equally distributed, add the  Raisins . Roll into an oval and place on a greased baking sheet. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Still on baking sheet, wrap dough well in aluminium foil and store in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Remove from refrigerator and take off foil. Sprinkle  flour  around the loaf to prevent the dough from spreading. Place loaf in a pre-heated 350-400° oven and bake 50–60 minutes, till pale gold in color. Remove from oven. Brush with melted  butter  and dust with  confectioner's sugar . Repeat until  butter  and  Sugar  are used up. Stollen should have a thick, white layer.
