 There are almost as many mulling spices recipes as there are people who make them. Everyone seems to have a slightly different way that they mix the traditional spices, or a secret ingredient to add. All will agree though, a good mulling spice recipe is an important part of the winter season!
 Mulling is the process of steeping whole spices and fruits in wine, cider, brandy, or juice. This process developed in Europe centuries ago and is a part of many holiday celebrations.
