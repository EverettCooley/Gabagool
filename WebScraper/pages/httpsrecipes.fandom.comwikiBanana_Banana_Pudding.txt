 Ingredients : 
 3 cups  milk 
 2  vanilla beans , split lengthwise 
 3/4 cup  Sugar 
 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon  cornstarch 
 Pinch of  salt 
 6 large  egg  yolks 
 2 tablespoons  unsalted butter , cut up 
 12 ounces  vanilla  wafers 
 5 ripe  bananas , peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick rounds 
 1 cup  heavy cream 
 2 tablespoons  confectioner's sugar 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  milk  and  vanilla beans  to a simmer in a medium saucepan over low heat. Using tongs, remove the beans from the  milk . Using the tip of a small sharp knife, scrape the tiny seeds from each bean back into the  milk .
 
 Whisk the  Sugar ,  cornstarch  and  salt  in a medium bowl. Add the  egg  yolks and whisk well. Gradually whisk in about half of the hot  milk , then pour the yolk mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the pudding comes to a full boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the  butter  until melted. Transfer to a medium bowl. Cover the pudding with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface and pierce a few holes in the wrap with the tip of a knife. Let stand until tepid, about 30 minutes.
 
 Spoon about 1 cup of the pudding into a 2- to 2 1/2-quart glass bowl. Layer the cookies,  bananas  and pudding in the bowl, ending with the pudding. Cover tightly and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.
 
 Whip the  cream  and confectioners'  Sugar  in a chilled medium bowl until stiff. Spread the  whipped cream  over the pudding. Serve chilled, spooned into bowls.
