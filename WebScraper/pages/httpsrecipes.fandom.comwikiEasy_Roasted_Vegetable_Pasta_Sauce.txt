 3 big  onions , or 4 small  onions 
 ½  garlic  bulb 
 1 lbs  mushrooms , cleaned and sliced

 2 tbsp fresh  basil , minced

 Peel the skin off the  garlic  cloves and set the cloves on top of the  onion  slices (one clove per  onion  slice). 
 Bake at 400 °F for 30 – 40 minutes. The vegetables should be soft and have just a few brown spots.
