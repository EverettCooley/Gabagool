Description : 
 This quick, spicy, tangy cabbage side dish stands in for the traditional salty Korean staple. Unlike fermented kimchi, this quick variation is best eaten shortly after preparing and does not keep its crunchy texture when stored. Enjoy it with grilled meats or chicken.
 ChupaNote: I doubled the garlic, ginger, red pepper and scallions. Used Japanese rice vinegar instead of distilled. We call it 'Korean Coleslaw'!!!!
