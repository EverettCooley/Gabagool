 Description : 
 This savory, juicy poultry dish is made and infused with real fruit juice and is baked to red-hot, steamy perfection, as it delivers a sour, warm flavor from the chicken.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 spring  chickens 
 2 medium  onions , chopped, red, white, or yellow only 
 1  scallion , chopped 
 2  red chilies , chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 ¼ cup  peanut oil 
 ¼ cup  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Cut and halve the spring chicken along the backbone. 
 Flatten each half slightly by pressing them down. 
 Use a food processor to process the onion, scallions, chili, garlic, oil, and lemon juice until smooth. 
 Pour the mixture over the chickens to marinade for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. 
 Preheat the oven to a moderate 180° C. Remove the chickens from the marinade, setting aside the marinade for later use. 
 Place the chicken in a baking dish in a single layer. 
 Bake for about 40 minutes, or until cooked and browned. 
 Occasionally brush the chicken with the marinade. Serve hot with white rice and vegetable dishes.
