Ingredients : 
 2 to 3 large  cucumbers 
 2 cups  mung bean sprouts 
 3 to 4 cups  fresh pea greens  — if you can find them—a leafy sprout could be substituted or these could be omitted 
 4 to 5 fresh  water chestnuts  — canned are also okay 
 2 tbsp  light soy sauce 
 1 tbsp  cider vinegar 
 1 tbsp freshly minced  garlic 
 several splashes to 1 tsp  tabasco sauce  (no, really, it works!) 
 1 tbsp  black bean sauce 
 ¼ tsp fresh ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  cucumber , slice it down the middle and remove the seeds. 
 Cut each half down the middle and slice these strips into bite sized pieces. 
 Toss  cucumbers  and  mung bean sprouts  into a large sealable container. 
 Mix the dressing separately and pour over the veggies. 
 Put the lid on the container and shake it. 
 Put it in the fridge to marinate for 3 hours or over night, shaking it whenever you think of it. :) 
 Just before serving add the pea greens and peeled, chopped water chestnuts and shake the whole thing together again.
