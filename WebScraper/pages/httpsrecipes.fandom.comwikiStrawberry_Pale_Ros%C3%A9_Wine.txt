Ingredients : 
 1.8 kilo ripe  strawberries 
 1 kilo  granulated sugar 
 1  lemon 
 1 teaspoon pectic enzyme 
 1 teaspoon  yeast  nutrient 
 all purpose  wine yeast 
 3 gram tannin or one cup of strong  tea 
 1  Campden tablet 
 Directions : 
 Remove the hulls and wash the  strawberries . Place the fruit in a bucket (preferred white) together with the juice and zest of the  lemon , the tannin or tea and the  Sugar . Pour 3.4 liters of boiling  water  over them. 
 Mash the  strawberries  with a plastic spoon and stir well to dissolve all the  Sugar . Cover the bucket and leave it to cool down. When cooled down, add a Campden tablet and the pectic enzyme to it. Cover again and leave it standing in a warm place for 24 hours. 
 After 24 hours you have to add the  yeast  and the  yeast  nutrient to it. Cover it again and leave it in a warm place for one week, stirring it daily. 
 Now you can strain the must into a jar. Be careful to not let any of the pulp into the jar when you do this! Top up to the jar to the shoulder with cool boiled  water  and fit an airlock in it. Leave to ferment until its nearly dry. 
 You can now add some  sugar syrup  to revive the fermentation and increase the alcohol percentage but do not add too much, else the wine will be very sweet. 
 When fermentation has stopped, rack the wine and allow it to clear. As soon as its clear, you can bottle it. Make sure you keep this wine in a cool and dark place, else it will fade. 
 It's best to leave it for at least six months before drinking it
