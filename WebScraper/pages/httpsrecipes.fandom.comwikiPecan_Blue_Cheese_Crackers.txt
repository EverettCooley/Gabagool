 Each log makes about 45 crackers 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  pecan  halves 
 1 large  egg 
 1 stick (½ cup)  unsalted butter , softened 
 ½ pound  Saga blue  cheese, softened 
 1 cup  all-purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 In a preheated 350°F oven toast ½ cup  pecans , about 7 minutes, and cool. 
 Finely chop toasted  pecans  and separate  egg . 
 In a bowl with a fork cream  butter  and Saga blue until smooth. 
 Add  egg  yolk, stirring until combined well. 
 Add  flour  and chopped  pecans  and stir until mixture just forms a dough. 
 Halve dough and on separate sheets of wax paper form each half into a 12- by 1¼-inch log, using wax paper as a guide. 
 Freeze logs, wrapped in wax paper, just until firm, about 30 minutes. 
 Preheat oven to 375°F and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. 
 Cut logs crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices and arrange slices about ½ inch apart on baking sheets. 
 Top each cracker with a remaining  pecan  half, pressing slightly into dough. 
 Brush tops of crackers, including  pecans , with lightly beaten  egg  white. 
 Bake crackers in batches, if necessary, in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 12 minutes total. 
 With a spatula transfer crackers to paper towels to blot and transfer to a rack to cool.
