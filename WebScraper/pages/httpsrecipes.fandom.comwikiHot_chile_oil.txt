 About Hot chili oil : 
 This is the kind of vegetable oil in which dried, hot chile peppers and other spices have been fried. When the oil becomes very spicy, then the spices are removed and the oil transferred to an airtight jar. The hot oil serves as a condiment at the table or stirred into a dish during the final stages of cooking.
