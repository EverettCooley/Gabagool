 Ingredients : 
 10 Sweet Dumpling, Carnival, or  delicata squash  - about ¾ lb each 
 ½ cup chopped  pecans 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 2  onions , chopped 
 2 cup chopped  celery 
 5¼ cup  vegetable broth 
 1½ cup  wild rice  rinsed, drained 
 2 tbl chopped fresh  sage  leaves 
 1½ cup  quinoa  rinsed, drained 
 ⅔ cup chopped  dried apricots 
 ⅓ cup chopped  dried cherries 
 ⅓ cup chopped  dried cranberries 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Rinse  squash , pierce each with a fork several times, and set in a 10- by 15-inch pan. Add ¾ cup  water  to pan and cover tightly with foil. 
 Bake in a 350 °F oven until the  squash  are tender when pierced, 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
 Meanwhile, in a 4- to 5-quart pan, stir chopped  pecans  over medium heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan. 
 Add  olive oil ,  onions , and  celery  to the pan; stir over medium-high heat until the  onions  are limp, about 6 minutes. 
 Add  vegetable broth ,  wild rice , and  sage . Bring to a boil over high heat. 
 Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 40 minutes. 
 Stir in  quinoa , cover, and simmer until both of the  grains  are tender to bite, 15 to 20 minutes longer. 
 Stir in  apricots ,  cherries ,  cranberries , and  pecans . 
 Add  salt  to taste. Keep warm until  squash  are ready. 
 When the  squash  are cooked, hold with a thick towel to protect hands, and cut ½ to ¾ inch off tops to form lids. Scoop out and discard seeds. 
 If needed, trim a little off  squash  bases so they sit steady and level. 
 Mound  grain  stuffing into  squash  cavities. 
 Set  squash  lids on filling and serve, adding  salt  to taste.
