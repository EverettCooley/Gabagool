 Ingredients : 
 Cake base : 
 1½ lbs  daikon 
 ½ lbs  rice flour 
 1 can  chicken broth 
 ¼ tbsp  msg 
 4 tbsp  sugar 
 1 tbsp  white pepper 
 Filling : 
 1 cup of Chinese  sausage 
 ½ cup of Chinese dried  shrimp 
 1 cup of  Chinese mushroom 
 2  scallion 
 2 tbsp  soy sauce 
 1 tbsp  sugar 
 1 tbsp cooking  wine 
 1 tbsp  sesame seed  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 First remove the  daikon  skin and slice into thin pieces. 
 Place the sliced  daikon , the  chicken broth  and the "cake base" seasonings into a pot. 
 Cook until the diakon is soft (about 40 minutes). 
 If the  daikon  tastes  bitter , you'll need to add more  sugar . 
 Also, if the  daikon  releases too much  water , you may have to drain some  water  out. 
 While the  daikon  is cooking, dice the "filling" ingredients. 
 Stir fry the "filling" ingredients and seasonings until cooked (note: save ½ the  scallion  for later use). 
 Place the fillings aside. 
 When the  daikon  is soft, slowly stir in the  rice flour . 
 Mix well. You'll feel the cake base thicken. 
 After the  daikon  and  rice flour  are mixed, stir in the "fillings" (note: save some of the filling for the topping). 
 When everything is mixed, grease the steaming pan with  corn oil , so the  daikon  cake won't stick to the pan. 
 Pour the  daikon  cake mix into the pan, and place the rest of the  scallion  and fillings on top. 
 Steam the  daikon  cake under high heat for about 40 minutes. 
 To check the cake is well cooked, poke a chopstick into the center of the cake, if the cake does not stick to the chopstick, the cake is cooked. 
 Allow the  daikon  cake to cool. 
 You can pan fry the sliced cake before serving.
