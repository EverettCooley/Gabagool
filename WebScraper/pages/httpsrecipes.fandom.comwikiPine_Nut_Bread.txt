 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  pine nuts 
 1 package  active dry yeast 
 ½ tsp  sugar 
 1 cup warm water 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 cup  whole wheat flour 
 2 cups unbleached white  flour 
 cornmeal  for the peel 
 1 tsp ground red  chili powder 
 Directions : 
 Toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet until they begin to color, shaking the pan occasionally so that they don't burn. Remove them from the heat and set aside to cool; then chop them finely by hand or in a food processor to make a fine meal. (Be careful not to overwork them, or the pine nuts will form a nut butter.) 
 Stir the yeast and sugar into the warm water and set the mixture aside for 10 minutes or until the surface is covered with bubbles. Stir in the salt, ground nuts, whole wheat flour, and as much white flour as you can, using a spoon. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it until it's smooth and silky, about 8 minutes, incorporating extra flour as needed. 
 Brush a film of oil in a bowl and set the dough in to rise for approximately 45 minutes, covered with a damp towel or a piece of plastic wrap. Let it double in bulk, then turn it out on counter and knead it briefly. Shape the dough into a round ball and set it aside to rise again on a peel or counter dusted with cornmeal or flour. While it is rising, preheat the oven to 375 °F. If you're using a baking stone, heat it at the same time. 
 When the bread has risen again, after 30 minutes or so, cut 4 or 5 deep slashes across the top. Mix the ground chili with a few spoonfuls of water and paint it over the surface of the bread. Slide the risen bread onto the baking stone and bake it until it's firm on top and lightly browned on the unglazed parts, about 40 minutes. Set the bread on a rack to cool.
