Description : 
 The term hash is not strictly correct, because the finished dish does not form a cake â€“ rather it is a mixture that is piled up. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 butter 
 225 g (8 oz)  ostrich  fillet, diced 
 salt and freshly ground  black pepper 
 small bunch of  spring onions , chopped 
 225 g (8 oz)  potatoes , diced and parboiled 
 100 g (4 oz)  pumpkin , diced and parboiled 
 1  red pepper , diced and blanched 
 1  green pepper , diced and blanched 
 1  yellow pepper , diced and blanched 
 4  eggs 
 Hollandaise sauce : 
 juice of 1  lemon 
 juice of 1  orange 
 juice of 1  grapefruit 
 2  egg yolks 
 275 g (10 oz) warm  clarified butter 
 Garnish : 
 1  orange , cut into segments 
 1  lemon , cut into segments 
 1 pink  grapefruit , cut into segments 
 Directions : 
 Heat a little butter in a pan and saute the diced ostrich. 
 Season, then add the spring onions, potatoes, pumpkin and peppers and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. 
 Meanwhile make the Hollandaise sauce. 
 First put the fruit juices into a pan, bring to the boil and reduce by half. 
 Put into a large heatproof bowl with the eeg yolks and whisk over a pan of hot water until frothy. 
 Dribble in the butter very slowly, whisking continuously until it is thick and creamy (if it becomes too thick, add a drop of water). 
 Poach the eggs. 
 To serve, pile the ostrich hash on to 4 warm plates, top each with a poached egg and a little Hollandaise sauce, and garnish with orange, lemon and grapefruit segments.
