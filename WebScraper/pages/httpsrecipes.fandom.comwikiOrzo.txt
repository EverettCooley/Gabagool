 About Orzo : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Orzo on Wikipedia 
 Orzo (from Latin hordeum) is Italian and means "barley", but in common usage in the United States, orzo is understood to mean rice-shaped pasta, slightly smaller than a pine nut. It is frequently used in soups.
 "Orzo" is also the name of a hot drink made from roasted barley in some parts of the world. In Italy, for instance, a "caffé d'orzo" is an espresso style drink made from ground roasted barley. When prepared from the roasted barley directly, it can be made in many standard espresso or coffee makers. Although traditionally considered a coffee substitute for children, it is an increasingly common choice in Italy and other places for those who choose to eschew coffee for health reasons. In the United States, instant roasted barley drinks are sold under the name of "Postum", "Pero", and others, including varieties of "café de cebada" in Latin American markets.
