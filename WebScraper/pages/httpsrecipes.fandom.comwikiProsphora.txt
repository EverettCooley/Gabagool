 A simple yet delicious bread.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pkg. compressed or dry  yeast 
 2½ cups  water 
 2 tsp  salt 
 6¾ to 7 cups  flour

 Dilute yeast in water. 
 Add salt, then half of four and stir. 
 Mix remainder of flour with hand until dough is firm. 
 Knead until dough is smooth. 
 Divide dough (unless you want a large loaf) and put in a covered bowl. 
 Let rise until dough has  almost  doubled in size. 
 Sprinkle a light layer of flour on a cookie sheet (unless you use those silicone mats) and put dough on cookie sheet (if your making two loaves put each on separate cookie sheet) take a brush (one that you would use for basting) and spread some flour over dough. 
 Bake in 400°F oven for approximately 30 minutes or until done.
