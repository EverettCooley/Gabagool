 About Udon : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Udon on Wikipedia 
Udon (Hiragana:うどん; Kanji:饂飩, rarely 餛飩; Traditional Chinese:烏冬, sometimes 烏冬麵) is a type of thick wheat-based noodle popular in Korean and Japanese cuisine. Udon is said to have been imported to Japan from China in the 6th century. This original udon was 2 to 3 cm in diameter, a flat pancake-shaped "noodle" added to miso-based soup. In modern Chinese, the characters 餛飩 refer to wonton dumplings, not noodles. (Compare pasta, which can be both noodle-like and dumpling-like.)
