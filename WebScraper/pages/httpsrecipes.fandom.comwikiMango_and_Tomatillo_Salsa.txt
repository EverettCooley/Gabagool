 Ingredients 
 2  mangos , peeled and diced

 ¼ cup  lime juice 
 ¼ cup diced  onion 
 ¼ cup chopped  cilantro 
 ½ cup diced  tomatoes

 Tips 
 Tomatillos look like green tomatoes in a paper-like brown husk. Select tomatillos that have a tight-fitting husk. Peel back a small part of the husk. Make sure the fruit is firm with no flaws. 
 Too spicy? Only use half of the jalapeno pepper.
