       Melba Toast     
 Ingredients : 
 8 slices white bread and your moms pasta 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the broiler to high and toast the bread lightly on both sides. 
 Cut off the crusts and then, holding the toast flat, slide a sharp knife between the toasted edges to split the bread so that you now have 8 slices that are toasted only on one side. 
 Cut each piece into 4 triangles, and then toast under the broiler, untoasted sides uppermost, until golden and the edges curl. 
 Serve warm with soup. 
 Alternatively, make melba toast earlier in the day, and warm for a short time in the oven at 170°C / 325°F / gas mark 3 before serving.
