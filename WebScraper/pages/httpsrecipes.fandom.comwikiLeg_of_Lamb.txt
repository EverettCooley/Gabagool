 Place into oven, then heat oven to 150-175°C (280-325°F), and roast for one hour for each kilo (2 lbs) of weight. 
 Pour the stock from the pan over the leg of  lamb  occasionally with a spoon. 
 For the last half hour of cooking switch on the grill, and grill the leg of  lamb  on both sides. 
 If you use a roasting bag, open it for the last half hour and grill in the same way. 
 Sieve the stock into a casserole and skim off the fat. 
 Thicken the sauce with  flour , or your favourite thickening, season and colour with gravy  browning . 
 Add the  cream  and remove from the heat.

 Caramel potatoes : 
 Place the  sugar  on a frying pan and heat until it starts melting, stir in the  margarine . 
 When golden, remove from heat, add  potatoes , rolling them carefully around so they are completely covered with caramel.
