 About Corn oil : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Corn oil on Wikipedia 
 Corn oil is oil extracted from the germ of corn. Its main use is in cooking, where its high smoke point makes it a valuable frying oil. It is also a key ingredient in some margarines. Corn oil has a milder taste and is less expensive than most other types of vegetable oils.
 One bushel of corn contains 1.55 pounds of corn oil (28 kg/mg). Corn agronomists have developed high-oil varieties; however, these varieties tend to show lower field yields, so they are never universally accepted by growers. Refined corn oil is 99% triglyceride, with proportions of approximately 59% polyunsaturated fatty acid, 24% monounsaturated fatty acid, and 13% saturated fatty acid.
