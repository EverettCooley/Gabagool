Bacon Artichoke Bundles
 1 lb Bacon 
1 Jar spicy brown mustard
3 Jars marinated artichoke hearts, (drained)
 Slice strips of bacon in half crosswise. Spread one side of bacon with a
thin layer of mustard. Drain artichoke hearts thoroughly and place one
piece of artichoke at one end of bacon. (If artichoke hearts are too large,
they may be sliced in half before wrapping in bacon.) Roll and secure with
a wooden toothpick. Place rolled bacon strips on a broiler pan, making sure
they do not touch each other. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 30-45 minutes,
turning once, until bacon is cooked. (This may be done early in the day.)
Drain on paper towels and refrigerate until serving time. Reheat on baking
sheet at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until hot.
 Enjoy.
