Description : 
 This Pennsylvania-style fudge is made, mixed and packed with real cream cheese, grated coconuts, and vanilla, and is great for dessert, as it delivers a glorious, bold aroma that it relishes and enhances with chocolate and the vanilla content while cold to eat. You can make this with honey, yogurt, and fruits in a fudge, while the effort and flavor are worth it.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 oz.  cream cheese 
 3 ⅓ cups sifted  confectioners' sugar 
 ½ cup shredded  coconut 
 ½ tsp.  vanilla  extract 
 dash of  salt , rock or sea only 
 1 x 1 oz. square semi-sweet or  unsweetened chocolate , melted 
 Directions : 
 Place the cream cheese in a bowl and cream it until soft and smooth. 
 Slowly blend the sugar into it. Add the shredded coconut. Mix well. 
 Add the vanilla and salt and mix until well blended. 
 Press into a well greased shallow pan. Place in the refrigerator until firm. 
 Spread the chocolate on the fudge and score the chocolate into squares. 
 Place in the refrigerator/freezer until the chocolate hardens. 
 Cut into squares simply following the scored pattern, then with a kitchen knife. Serve cold and plain or with other desserts.
