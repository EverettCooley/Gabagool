       Potage aux Poireaux et au Gingembre     
 I found this recipe in "Elle" magazine and just had to try it. This is a great comfort food recipe for cold & flu season, as it helps fight those bouts of the chills! It's also a nice recipe for dinner parties because, although it's a little time-consuming to prepare, it is easy to make, and is quite filling, so a little goes a long way. Hope you enjoy it!
 
 Ingredients : 
 3  leeks 
 3  potatoes 
 1 liter  chicken bouillon 
 2 teaspoons  butter 
 1 piece  ginger 
 ¼ loaf stale  French bread 
 ½ bunch fresh  chives 
 1 cup  sour cream 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil  (approx.) 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Wash and peel the  potatoes  and cut into small chunks. 
 Wash and chop  leeks . 
 Peel and chop  ginger  (i couldn't find whole  ginger  in the supermarket, so i just used regular  ground ginger , 1 to 1½ tsp, I think) 
 Cut or tear the bread into small pieces. 
 Heat  olive oil  in a pan and add bread. 
 Brown bread until just toasted. 
 Move bread onto a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess  oil . 
 Wash and chop  chives  (here again, i just used dried  chives  as the store was out of fresh). 
 In a large saucepan, cook  potatoes  in the bouillon for 25 minutes. 
 In a sauté pan, melt  butter  and stir in  ginger . 
 Then add the  leeks  and let sautée 8 minutes, stirring often. 
 When the  potatoes  are ready, add the  leeks  and the bread to the saucepan. 
 Mix well. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Pour into soup bowls. 
 Sprinkle with  chives  and serve topped with a spoonful of  sour cream .
