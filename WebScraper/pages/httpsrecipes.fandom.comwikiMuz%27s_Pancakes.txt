Description : 
 I have more cookbooks... but many do not have recipes on page 17. It's usually some part of an intro to the cookbook. Here is a Page 17 recipe: Muz's Pancakes (The World's Best)

 Ingredient : 
 1 cup  flour, all-purpose 
 2 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  baking soda 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tbsp  sugar 
 1  egg 
 1 cup  buttermilk 
 ½ cup melted  butter , divided 
 Directions : 
 Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. 
 Gently add liquid ingredients, including ¼ cup of butter, and stir until just incorporated. 
 Do not overwork the batter. 
 The batter is thick; if you like, it can be thinned with a small amount of water or a little more buttermilk. 
 Cook pancakes on a lightly greased griddle. 
 Pancakes should be turned only once. 
 They are ready to be turned when bubbles form in the middle and the edges appear cooked. 
 Once pancakes are turned, use a pastry brush to spread the additional melted butter on top of the pancakes while the other side is cooking. 
 This will keep you from having to spread cold butter on them, which will tear them. 
 The pancakes will already be buttered once they reach the table. 
 Top with real maple syrup.
