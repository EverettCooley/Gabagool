Description : 
 This recipe includes diced canned  tomatoes  which is rich in lycopene and is one of the most potent antioxidants. Olive oil is also very good for heart health, and the beans supply a lot of fiber and a source of complex carbohydrate which help promote good blood  sugar  levels. It also tastes great and takes only a few minutes to make!
