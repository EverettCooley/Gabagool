      Egg White     
 About egg white : 
 Egg white  is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. The rest of the egg is known as the  yolk .  See also :  powdered egg white .
 Egg white is also known as albumen, accounts for 60% of an egg's liquid weight. Beaten egg whites are an important component of many baked goods, such as cakes, because they provide structure, volume and leavening. As an egg ages, the egg white loses carbon dioxide, causing the white to become more thin and transparent. This causes older eggs to spread out in a pan, rather than retaining their shape and height. Egg white is an excellent source of protein and also contains niacin and riboflavin.
