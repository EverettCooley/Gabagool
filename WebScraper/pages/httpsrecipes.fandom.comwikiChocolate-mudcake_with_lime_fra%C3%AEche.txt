 Description : 
 
This recipe is translated from Swedish, so the measurements are in 
 Litre . Teaspoon and tablespoon measurements seem to be the same, a teaspoon is 5 ml and a tablespoon is 15 ml. Some like the mudcake cold, but personally I prefer to eat it as soon as I can without getting a burn.
 
 Ingredients : 
 
 3 dl  sugar 
 1 1/2 dl  wheat flour 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 4 1/2 tablespoon  cocoa 
 1 1/2 dl soft  margarine 
 Lime fraîche: 
 2 1/2 dl  crème fraîche  (24% fat content in the original recipe) 
 1  lime , grated peel and lime juice 
 2 1/2 teaspoon  vanilla sugar 
 
 Directions : 
 
 Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl. 
 Stir in the eggs and the soft margarine. 
 Pour the mix into a baking mould that's been greased and sprinkled with flour or breadcrumbs. The mould should have a removable bottom. 
 Bake in 200 °C for 20-25 minutes. The cake should be loose and sticky on the inside. 
 Overturn when the cake has cooled down. Sift vanilla sugar over the cake (this is optional in my opinion, esp. since it's apparently hard to get by in some places). 
 Serve with the lime fraîce. The cake is also nice with fresh berries and/or whipped cream. 
 Lime fraîche 
 Carefully wash the lime. Grate the peel (only the green). My cookbook recommends a zester, but a normal grater works fine. 
 Mix the crème fraîche, the vanilla sugar and the lime zest. Add half of the lime juice. Taste it off and add more lime juice if needed
