1/2 cup peanut butter, creamy or crunchy
1/2 tsp. vanilla 
1 egg
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 Cream butter with sugar and peanut butter. 
 Add vanilla and egg. Beat until fluffy. 
 Stir in baking soda and salt. 
 Blend in flour. Mix until a stiff dough forms.
 Shape into walnut-sized balls.
