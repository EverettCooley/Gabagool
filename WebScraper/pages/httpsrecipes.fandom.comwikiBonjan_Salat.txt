 Yield: 8 servings
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 medium  eggplants 
 2½ teaspoons  coarse salt ; ( kosher salt ) 
 ¼ cup  corn oil 
 1½ cups  tomato sauce 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper 
 1 teaspoon hot red  chili flakes  or 1 teaspoon minced fresh  chiles 
 2 teaspoons ground  cinnamon 
 1 tablespoon dried  mint ; crushed 
 Directions : 
 Slice the  eggplants  crosswise into 1½ inch thick pieces. 
 Sprinkle them with 2 tsp  coarse salt  and let stand for 15 minutes. 
 Rinse  eggplants  under cold  water , which removes the  bitter  taste, rinse, and dry well on a towel. 
 Heat the  oil  in a skillet and lightly brown  eggplant  slices over moderate heat for 3 minutes. 
 Remove and put into a serving bowl. 
 Cool. 
 Put the  tomato  sauce,  pepper ,  chile ,  cinnamon ,  mint  and ½ tsp  salt , if wanted, in a pan. 
 Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, which is long enough to integrate the flavors. 
 Pour this over the  eggplant ; refrigerate until ready to use. 
 The salad can remain in the refrigerator for several days. 
 Serve cold or at room temperature.
