      Caramelize     
 To make a mixture of sugar and butter, heat over low heat until brown and coast vegetables or meat according to recipes instructions. 
 "Caramelized" corresponds to the taste acquired by roasted beans that have been dipped in sugar, dextrin syrup, or molasses before roasting. Also perceived in spray-dried instant coffees.
 All meat and vegetables contain some sugar (in the form of carbohydrates). Under intense dry heat, as in roasting or sauteing, these sugars break down. The result is the brown color and rich flavor called "caramelization".
