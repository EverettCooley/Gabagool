INGREDIENTS : 
 130g unsalted butter, softened 
 3 eggs 
 1 cup caster sugar 
 pinch of salt 
 1 1/2 cups plain flour 
 1 teaspoon baking powder 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup milk 
 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Preheat oven to 180C. Grease a bunt pan with butter and dust with flour. 
 Combine all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until smooth and mixed for about 5 to 6 minutes. Pour batter in the prepared bundt pan. Bake for approximately 40 minutes until golden and cooked through. Remove from oven. 
 Wait a couple of minutes, whack the pan on all sides and knock it hard on the countertop to loosen the cake. Turn it over onto a plate to dislodge the cake from the pan. Dust with icing sugar to serve.
