Pink flakes of dried  bonito  ( tuna ), which are used in Japanese cooking as a garnish and in some cooked preparations, principally  Dashi . The tuna is boiled, smoked, then sun-dried. A special tool is used to flake the extremely hard chunks. Depending on how fresh it is when purchased, it can be stored in a cool, dry place up to a year.
