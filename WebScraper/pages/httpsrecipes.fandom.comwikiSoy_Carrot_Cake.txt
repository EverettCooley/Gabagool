 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup  Raisins 
 1 cup coarsely chopped  walnuts  (4 oz.) 
 1 1/2 cups whole- Wheat   pastry flour 
 1 1/2 cups unbleached white  flour 
 1 Tbs.  baking powder 
 2 tsp.  baking soda 
 2 tsp. ground  cinnamon 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 1 tsp. ground  allspice 
 3/4 tsp. ground  nutmeg 
 1 cup  maple syrup 
 3/4 cup  canola oil 
 1/2 cup  soymilk 
 2 Tbs.  pure vanilla extract 
 1 Tbs.  cider vinegar 
 3 cups packed, finely  Grated Carrots 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 10-inch tube pan. In small bowl, combine  Raisins  and enough warm  water  to cover and let soak for 20 minutes.
 
 Meanwhile, spread  walnuts  in small baking pan and bake until toasted, stirring once or twice, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven; maintain oven temperature.
 
 In large bowl, sift both flours,  baking powder ,  baking soda ,  cinnamon ,  salt ,  allspice  and  nutmeg .
 
 In another large bowl, stir together  maple syrup ,  oil ,  soy milk ,  vanilla extract  and  vinegar . Sprinkle  Grated Carrots  into  flour  mixture and mix until well coated (mixture will appear dry and crumbly). Gradually add  maple syrup  mixture, stirring with wooden spoon. Drain  Raisins  and stir into batter along with toasted  walnuts  (batter will be rather stiff). Spoon batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly. Bake until cake pulls away from sides of pan and is firm with a little spring to the touch, 45 to 60 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes in pan. To remove from pan, run knife around edge of pan and turn cake out onto wire rack. Cool completely, then remove inner tube.
