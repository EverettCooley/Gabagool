 Description : 
 This recipe is easily prepared on the grill and can be served as a relish, dip, or spread. As might be expected, it can also be served with a flat, unleavened bread such as pita. Use a mortar and pestle for a traditional method of grinding the grilled vegetables, or just mash and mix with a fork in a bowl. For a much hotter dip, substitute jalapeño chiles.
 
 Yield: About 2 cups 
 Heat Scale: Medium 
 Ingredients : 
 1  red   or   yellow bell pepper , cut in half, seeds removed 
 2 medium  tomatoes 
 1 small  onion , cut in half 
 4 green  New Mexico  or  poblano chiles 
 3 whole cloves  garlic 
 2 to 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 teaspoons  lemon juice , fresh preferred 
 1 tablespoon  caraway seeds  or 1 tablespoon  cumin  seeds 
 1 tablespoon chopped brine-cured  black olives 
 chopped  parsley  for garnish 
 1 small loaf  French bread 
 Directions : 
 Place the  bell pepper ,  tomatoes ,  onion , chiles, and  garlic  on medium-hot grill, and grill until the skins become charred and blistered. 
 The  onions  will take longer to cook than the rest of the vegetables. 
 Remove the vegetables from the grill, place in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth to loosen the skins. 
 Remove the skins, but don’t worry—a few charred pieces will add an interesting flavor dimension. 
 Mash the vegetables together and place the mixture in a bowl. 
 Mix the remaining ingredients, except for the bread, and pour over the vegetables and gently toss. 
 Transfer to a serving bowl. 
 Serve the dip with the bread and encourage guests to tear the bread into chunks and dip in mixture.
