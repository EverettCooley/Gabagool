 There are different types of appreciated Senegalese appetizers, dishes that you will find both in restaurants all around the world and in traditional Senegalese homes. Among the most popular we will name the Senegalese Fish Cakes, the Sweet & Spicy Pork Ribs or the Ginger Chicken Wings. Exotic appetizers like the Pork Skewers with Senegalese herbs or those types of appetizers that combine the sweet with the salty, such as the Fresh Spring Rolls with Ginger Dipping Sauce are also joined by a variety of pickled food, such as the Pickled Vegetable Medley. Often compared to other African cuisines, the Senegalese cuisine is lighter, less oily and the use of spices is not quite as heavy. In Senegal, meals carry far more value than what Europeans or Americans place on their eating habits, and a good appetizer is always a desirable presence at a Senegalese meal.
