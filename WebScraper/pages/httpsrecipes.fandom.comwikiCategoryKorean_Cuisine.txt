Some of the traditional Korean meals are the noodles, the rice mixes, the pork and beef dishes and the sweet desserts. Rice mixes are usually topped with veggies and sometimes with raw eggs. The pork is used for the stews and the thick soups with rice and soy and dough and beans are used for the preparation of defend desserts. The main characteristic of this cuisine is its spiciness: red pepper, green onion, soy sauce, bean paste, garlic, ginger, sesame, mustard, and vinegar, wine have been combined in various ways to achieve the unique Korean taste. On the coast of the Yellow Sea or the Eastern sea, seafood is the main ingredient for the meals. In these regions, sardines are eaten even at breakfast. The Korean cuisine includes meals with moderate calories, but with many fibers and proteins: bean curd, bean sprouts, bean paste, soy sauce and all the meats.
