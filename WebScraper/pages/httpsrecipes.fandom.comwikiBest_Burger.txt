 Description : 
 Bacon, mushroom cheeseburger on Onion roll.
 This is the ultimate burger that was originally made for me by a friend of mine substituting the ground sirloin for thin sliced deli roast beef.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ lb  ground sirloin  (ask your butcher to grind up a sirloin steak for best results.) 
 onion roll or onion bagel 
 2 slices of  bacon 
 sautéed  mushrooms  (browned mushrooms in  butter  and  garlic  in frying pan) *Optional 
 generous slice of sharp  Cheddar 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Form patty, season with salt and pepper both sides. 
 Grill burger to desired cooking temperature. I like mine medium, so 5-7 mins each side will do. 
 Cook bacon. 
 Sauté Mushrooms in butter and fresh garlic. 
 Slice cheese 
 Toast Onion roll in broiler or on grill. 
 Assemble.
