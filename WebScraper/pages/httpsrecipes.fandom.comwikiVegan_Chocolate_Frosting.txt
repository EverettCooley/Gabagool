Ingredients : 
 1 stick (½ cup) vegan  margarine  (I really don't think  oil  will work in this) 
 ⅔ cup  cocoa 
 3 cups  powdered sugar 
 ⅓ cup  soy  or nut  milk 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Melt  margarine . 
 Stir in  cocoa . 
 Alternately add  powdered sugar  and  milk , beating on medium speed to spreading consistency. 
 Add more  milk , if needed. 
 Add  vanilla . 
 Makes enough to frost a round 9" layered cake or one 9" x 13" square cake.
