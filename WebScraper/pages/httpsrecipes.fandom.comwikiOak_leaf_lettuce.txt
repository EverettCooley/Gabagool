 About Oakleaf lettuce : 
 The name of this plant comes from  Lactuca sativa . In French it is called feuille de chene and it grows in areas characterised by Mediterranean and temperate climates. Oak leaf lettuce is a type of butter lettuce, with leaves that measure from 10 to 15cm. It has colourful borders of autumn and red shades and it is used as a garnish. The flavour of this type of lettuce is meant to accompany delicate flavours, and it can be both cooked or stuffed.
When buying oak leaf lettuce, everyone should know that this plant has to be deeply coloured, and its leaves have to be curly, crisp and firm. Moreover, oak leaf lettuce does not keep for a long time and this is why it must be stored in the vegetable crisper of the refrigerator or in dark and cool place. As far as the nutritional values are concerned, oak leaf lettuce is rich in minerals and vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E. When washing its leaves you have to do this quickly so that it retains its nutrients. This type of lettuce goes well with any vinaigrette. For a tasty dish you could try placing a piece of grilled salmon on oak leaf lettuce, sprinkle with lemon juice and olive oil, lay peach slices on top, sprinkle with honey and oil, spoon remoulade sauce over oak leaf and top with sauteed scallops, and sprinkle with walnut oil and walnuts.
