 Contributed by Miles Kimball 
 Ingredients : 
 3 hard-boiled  egg yolks 
 4 tbsp  shortening 
 2 cups  flour 
 1  egg yolk 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 ½ tsp grated  lemon rind 
 4 tbsp  butter 
 ½ tsp grated  orange rind 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 Your most blasé guests' taste buds will tingle 
 when they sample your Christmas Cookie Kringle 
 Through a strainer the hard-boiled  eggs  you force, 
 using the back of a spoon, of course, 
 then combine with the raw  egg yolk 
 that's how it's done by the German folk. 
 Work in the  sugar , the  butter , the  shortening  and when it's combined, 
 add the  flour , cinnamon,  vanilla  and all of the rind 
 now into a ball you roll the dough, 
 and chill it and roll it to and fro. 
 When it's ⅛ inch thick you cut it out neat, 
 use a doughnut cutter and a cookie sheet 
 now paint each cookie with unbeaten  egg white 
 and sprinkle with pistachios to add to the delight. 
 At 350°F, 8 – 10 minutes you bake. 
 And you'll be proud of the kringle you make.
