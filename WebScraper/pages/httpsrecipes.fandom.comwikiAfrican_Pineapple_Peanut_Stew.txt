 Ingredients : 
 1 cup chopped  white onions 
 2  garlic  cloves minced 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 4 cups sliced  kale   [1] 
 2 cups undrained canned crushed  pineapple 
 ½ cup creamy  peanut butter 
 1 tablespoon  hot pepper sauce 
 ½ cup chopped  cilantro 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 In a covered saucepan, sauté the  onions  and  garlic  in the  oil  for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the  onions  are lightly browned. 
 While the  onions  sauté, wash the  kale . 
 Remove the stems. 
 Stack the leaves on a cutting surface and slice crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. 
 Add the  pineapple  and its juice to the  onions  and bring to a simmer. 
 Stir in the  kale , cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until just tender. 
 Mix in the  peanut butter ,  hot pepper sauce , and simmer for 5 minutes. 
 Add  salt  to taste. 
 Serve over  couscous  or  rice . 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   You can use  spinach  instead of the  kale  but you may wish to use more as the  spinach  shrivels up considerably more than the  kale  does.
