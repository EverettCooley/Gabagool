 Directions :

 Remove stalks and seeds from large dried chilies and soak in hot  water  for 10 minutes. 
 With mortar and pestle pound the chilies  garlic ,  lemon  leaves, laos,  lemon grass  or  lemon  rind to a paste (an electric blender can be used, but it may be necessary to add a tablespoon or so of thick  coconut milk  to facilitate blending to a paste).
