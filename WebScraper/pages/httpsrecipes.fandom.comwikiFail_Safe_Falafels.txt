 Ingredients : 
 1 lb bag of garbanzos* (Goya brand is what I use) 
 2 medium  potatoes , peeled 
 1 medium  Onion , peeled 
 2 cloves of  garlic 
 1-2 tablespoon  curry  powder 
 1-2 tablespoon  chili powder 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 2-3 tablespoon of  flour 
 1 tablespoon  baking soda 
 Directions : 
 Soak the garbanzos overnight in  water  (at least 12 hours, I usually wait 24). When ready to prepare, drain them and put them through a food grinder with the  Onion ,  Potato  and  garlic . Add the seasoning and  flour , mix and let sit for about 2-3 hours. 
 When you are ready to deep fry, add the  baking soda  and mix again. Heat about 2-3 inches of  canola oil  in a deep, heavy frying pan to just below smoke point. Form mixture into patties about the size of a golf ball, flatten slightly, and place in the  oil  for about 2 minutes, turning a couple of times. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper. 
 Serve on warm pita with whatever you like on your falafel.
