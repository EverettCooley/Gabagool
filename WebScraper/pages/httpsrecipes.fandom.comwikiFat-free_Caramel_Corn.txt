Description : 
 homemade caramel  corn  is much superior to anything you can buy in a package. Or at karmelkorn, for that matter. Once you know how to do it, you can play around with other flavorings, like  cinnamon oil  (use sparingly!) or other  extracts .
 
 Ingredients : 
 popcorn 
 2 cups  light brown sugar 
 ¾ cup  water 
 ½ tbsp  vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Combine the above in a 2-qt. saucepan, bring to boil (stirring to dissolve  sugar  completely). 
 Continue boiling and stirring until syrup thickens and reaches the "hard-crack" stage -- consult the candy-making section of any comprehensive cookbook for description and candy-thermometer temperature. 
 My method of determining readiness is when the syrup "makes threads" when dropped off the tip of a spoon or when a drop allowed to fall into a cup of cool tap  water  forms a ball instantly. 
 It takes practice -- cook too long and the coating will be granular; cook not long enough and it'll be sticky. 
 When the syrup reaches the desired stage, take it off the burner, immediately stir in 1 teaspoon  vanilla  and ¼ teaspoon  baking soda  (the soda interacts with the  vinegar "s acidity and makes the syrup light and sort of foamy). 
 Pour gradually over popped  corn  while stirring with a long-handled spoon to distribute the coating (or have someone else do the stirring or pouring). 
 This stuff is very hot and will stick to you and inflict deep burns so be careful!.
