 Description : 
 A tangy combination of real limes and tahini is made with fresh  miso , spices, and herbs and served as a dip, as it then provides the sauce with some brownish zest. Oyster sauce rarely works for this, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ¾ cups tahini 
 1 ⅞ cup fresh  lime  or  lemon juice 
 3 teaspoons blond  miso 
 2 medium scallions, finely chopped 
 1 ⅜ tsp.  salt 
 1 ⅜ tsp. freshly ground  pepper , black only 
 2 tablespoons cayenne 
 parsley, optional 
 rosemary, optional 
 Directions : 
 In a blender or food processor, puree all ingredients and ⅜ cup  water  until smooth. 
 If the sauce is too thick, thin with a little more  water  or  lime juice . Top with the parsley or rosemary, if desired. 
 Use as a dip. Reserve the remaining lime-based sauce in the refrigerator.
