Ingredients : 
 2 pounds of  flour 
 7 whole  eggs 
 1Â½ tbsp  salt 
 1 cup of  water 
 Directions : 
 In a small mixing bowl mix  eggs  with the  water  and  salt . 
 Beat well. 
 Put the  flour  in a large mixing bowl and add the  egg  mixture a little at a time. 
 Blend the dough with your hands in a rubbing motion as though you were washing your hands with the palms open. 
 The mix should become uneven little pieces of dough the size of dried  peas . 
 Break up any that look large. 
 The mix should be somewhat uniform. 
 Spread out a tablecloth on a table and spread the tarhonya on it in a thin layer so that all the pieces are exposed to the air. 
 Let dry until very hard, this will take 3 or 4 days. 
 While the mix is drying, roll your fingers through to mix it up so all sides are exposed to air. 
 When you are sure that the mix has dried hard, store in a container.
