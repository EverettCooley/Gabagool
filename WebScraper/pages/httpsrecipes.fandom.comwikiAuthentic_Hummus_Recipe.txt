The following recipe is designed to yield 4 portions (bowl-size) of hummus.
 Ingredients: 
 
 1 cup dried chickpeas (the smallest you can find) 
 1/2 cup tahini 
 juice from one lemons 
 1-2 garlic cloves 
 1/2 teaspoon cumin 
 1 tablespoon + 1/8-1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 salt 
 olive oil - extra virgin 
 fresh parsley 
 Preparation: 
 
 1. Examine the chickpeas in a large container, take out what seems to not belong there.
 2. Wash the chickpeas  until the water is transparent, then soak them in clean water over night with a tablespoon of baking soda. Later, wash them and soak again in tap water for several more hours. The grains should now absorb most of the water and almost double their volume. Wash them again.
 3. Place in a large pot and cover with water, add the rest baking soda and no salt. Cook until the chickpeas become soft and easily turn to mush. Remove the peels floating in the pot. When done, sieve the grains and keep the cooking water.
 4. Put the chickpeas into a food processor and grind to a thin paste. Leave it to chill a little while before you proceed.
 5. Add the tahini and the rest of the ingredients and go on proceed with the food processor until you get the desired texture. If the Humus is too thick, add some of the cooking water. It should be thinner than the actual desired texture.
 Serve with some good olive oil and chopped parsley.
