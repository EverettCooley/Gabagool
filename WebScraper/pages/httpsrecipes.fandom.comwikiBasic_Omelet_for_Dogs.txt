 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 6  eggs 
 salt 
 Ground  black pepper 
 6 tablespoons non salted  butter 
 4 tablespoons cooked chopped meat,  Chicken , fish, or grated  Cheese 
 Directions : 
 Beat  eggs  well in a large mixing bowl with a fork or whisk for 40 seconds. Mix in the  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Melt the  butter  in a frying pan over medium heat. Pour  eggs  into the frying pan when you see that the  butter  is brown. Mix the  eggs  for a little and then cook. Use a spatula to avoid the  eggs  from sticking to the frying pan. The  eggs  are done when you see that they are creamy on the top, but not runny anymore. 
 Put the meat over the omelet with a spoon. Tilt the pan and fold the omelet into half. Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve right away.
