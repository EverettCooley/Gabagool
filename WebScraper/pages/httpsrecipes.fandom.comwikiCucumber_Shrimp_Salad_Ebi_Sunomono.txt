 Description : 
 This is from a sushi feature in Sunset Magazine. But the  shrimp  in this salad isn't raw. It looked so good; I'm saving it here for later and sharing with you. The  cucumbers  become more flavorful, the longer you soak them. You need to chill it up to 2 hours, but 30 minutes at the very least.
