HAMBURGER/HOT DOG CHILI
 1 lb. ground beef
1 garlic clove, minced
1 cup tomato juice
1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
 In a large skillet, brown ground beef and garlic; drain.
Stir in next six ingredients.
Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
Serve over hamburgers and hot dogs.
 This is the basic recipe. As all cooks do, I alter the amounts and/or 
ingredients at times. And I always make a double batch so we have 
leftovers (good to use with a jar of spaghetti sauce if we run out of 
dogs or burgers). In addition to the chili, we use a combination of 
toppings for the dogs...mustard, dill relish, onions, and KFC 
coleslaw. The burger toppings are the same as for the dogs except to 
use dill pickle chips and slices of cheese. But the very best for us 
is just to use the chili and the coleslaw on top of that. YUMMMM!!!
