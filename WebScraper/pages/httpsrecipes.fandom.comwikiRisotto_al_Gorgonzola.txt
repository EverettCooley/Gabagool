      Risotto al Gorgonzola     
 Ingredients : 
 3 cubes of  beef bouillon 
 6 cups  water 
 1 diced  onion 
 1½ cups  long-grain rice 
 1 cup  white wine  (optional) 
 ½ cup crumbled  gorgonzola 
 ground  pepper 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 3 tablespoon  olive oil 
 1 tablespoon  margarine 
 Directions : 
 Bring to boil the  water  with 3 cubes of  beef  bouillon to make a broth. 
 Set aside ¼ cup of broth that you will use by the end. 
 Rinse and drain the  rice  in a colander. 
 In a large saucepan, heat the  olive oil  and stir-fry the  onion . 
 Combine the  rice  and stir in medium heat for about 5 minutes. 
 Pour in the wine and let it boil for more one minute. 
 Then add one cup of the boiling broth to cook the  rice  in low heat. 
 Keep adding more boiling broth when necessary to keep the  rice  cooking until tender (about 25 minutes). 
 But just add half cup at a time. 
 The  rice  is supposed to be free of  water  when done. 
 When the  rice  is tender, mix in the  gorgonzola , ground  pepper ,  salt ,  margarine  and the ¼ cup of broth you set aside.
