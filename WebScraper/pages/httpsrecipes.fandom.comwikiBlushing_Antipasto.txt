Ingredients : 
 6 oz can of  V-8 juice 
 ¼ cup  salad oil 
 2 tbsp  vinegar 
 6 oz pkg  Italian dressing  mix 
 2 cup  cauliflowerets 
 2 cup sliced fresh  mushrooms 
 1 cup sliced  carrots 
 1 cup sliced  green pepper 
 1 cup sliced  cucumber 
 Directions : 
 To make marinade: in jar, combine  V-8 juice ,  salad oil ,  vinegar , and  salad dressing  mix; shake well. 
 In bowl, combine vegetables; pour marinade over all. 
 Marinate in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally. 
 Note: if not going to be eaten the same day, perhaps wait to add  mushrooms  and  cucumbers  until a few hours before serving — they will go limp instead of remaining crisp. 
 The balance can be combined and marinated up to a couple of days ahead of serving in the refrigerator. 
 I have found it works best if you marinate in a tightly covered bowl. 
 Then when you are in the kitchen and think about it, you can just turn it upside down, shake it a bit, and put it back in the frig instead of stirring it.
