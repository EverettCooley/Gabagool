Description : 
 This one came in a Dutch -language "health magazine" called  Zin  IN MEER (really just a trumped-up advertising folder) that I received in the mail last week and it was so unusual that I had to try it out immediately. My family loved it. The name of the magazine translates loosely into "Liking/Desire for More", by the way, and I know I'm already craving more of this flavorful, and very attractive fall soup.
