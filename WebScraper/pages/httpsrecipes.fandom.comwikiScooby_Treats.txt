 Ingredients : 
 2 cups whole- wheat flour 
 1 tbsp.  baking powder 
 1 cup  Peanut   butter  (chunky or smooth) 
 1 cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375'F. In a bowl, combine  flour  and  baking powder . In another bowl, mix  Peanut   butter  and  milk , then add to dry ingredients and mix well. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and knead. Roll dough to 1/4Â inch thickness and use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes. Bake for 20 minutes on a greased baking sheet until lightly brown. Cool on a rack, then store in an airtight container. --- This is the original recipe, but I have found the cookies burn easily.
