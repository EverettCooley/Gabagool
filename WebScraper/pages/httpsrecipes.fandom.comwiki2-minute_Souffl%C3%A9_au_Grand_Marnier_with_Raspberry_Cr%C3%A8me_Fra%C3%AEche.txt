Description : 
 When you consider that this majestic soufflé takes 2 minutes to assemble, and that it can also be assembled in advance, you will keep this little treasure handy. I don't have to remind you that as soufflés require a good deal of preparation (separating  eggs , making a white sauce, beating whites separately, folding at the last minute), they are not often considered for company. This little gem can be assembled earlier in the day and baked before serving. Serves 6
