 Description : 
 To find a Frenchman, look for the freshly baked baguette tucked under his arm. Few Parisians manage to make it home without breaking off a chunk and enjoying the warm, yeasty goodness. Perhaps if they knew this  savory  French-style guacamole awaited them, more baguettes would survive to the front door!
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  California avocados , about 1 pound 
 ½ Tbsp fresh  lemon juice 
 2 Tbsp finely chopped  shallot 
 1 ½ Tbsp  dry vermouth 
 1 Tbsp chopped, fresh  tarragon  or 1/2 tablespoon dried 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely mash (DO NOT PUREE) avocados
 Stir in  lemon juice 
 Fold in remaining ingredients 
 Guacamole is best made as close to serving as possible. For short-term storage, seal in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole.
