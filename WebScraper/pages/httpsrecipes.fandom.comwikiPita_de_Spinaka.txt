 1½ lbs fresh  spinach 
 3  eggs , beaten 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 ⅛ tsp  pepper 
 ¼ cup  matzoh meal

 water , cold 
 2 tbsp  oil 
 1 tbsp  walnut 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely chop the stems and leaves. 
 Mix with the  eggs ,  salt ,  pepper , and matzoh meal. 
 Set aside moisten the sheets of matzoh with cold  water , just enough to soften but not so much that they break up. 
 Rub a heatproof glass or metal baking dish, about 9x6x2", with all but 1 teaspoon of the  oil . 
 Put 2-½ sheets of the moist matzoh -- big enough to turn up around the edges -- on the bottom of the dish. 
 Add the  spinach  mixture and cover with remaining 1-½ sheets of the matzoh for the pie cover. 
 Brush with the reserved 1 teaspoon of  oil  and sprinkle the  walnuts  over the top. 
 Bake in a preheated 350 °f oven for 30 minutes. 
 Serve warm, cut into generous squares or triangles. 
 Variations : 
 Mix ½ pound  ground beef  with the  spinach ,  eggs ,  salt ,  pepper , and  matzoh meal , and proceed as above. 
 Or chop ¼ pound  farmer cheese  and ¼ pound of  feta  cheese and mix this with the  spinach ,  eggs ,  salt ,  pepper , and  matzoh meal , and proceed as for the  spinach  pie.
