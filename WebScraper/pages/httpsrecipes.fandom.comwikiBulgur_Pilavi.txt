Description : 
 Cracked wheat pilaf.
 
       Bulgur Pilavi     
 Ingredients : 
 125 ml (4 fl oz)  olive  or  groundnut oil 
 1 medium-size  onion , sliced very finely 
 25 gr (1 oz)  vermicelli 
 250 gr (8 oz)  bulghur  ( cracked wheat ), picked clean 
 300 ml (½ pint)  chicken  (or  vegetable ) stock 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  and saute the  onion  until it glistens; add the  vermicelli , breaking it with your hands. 
 Continue to saute together for 4–5 minutes until it all looks pale golden. 
 Place the  bulghur  in a fine sieve, wash it briefly under running  water  and add it to the saucepan. 
 Add the  chicken stock  and season, but do not add  salt  if your stock was made from a stock cube; mix well. 
 Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 6 – 7 minutes at most, until the mixture is dry. 
 Cover with tea towel, place the lid tightly on top and let it stand for 10 minutes before serving (on uncovering the saucepan you will find its aroma is quite overpowering). 
 The  bulgur  pilavi will keep quite hot and fresh, if covered like this, for about one hour and it keeps its texture if reheated with 2 – 3 tablespoons of  water  the next day.
