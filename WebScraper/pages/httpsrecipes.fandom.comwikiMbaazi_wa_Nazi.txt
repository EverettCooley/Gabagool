 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 one pound pigeon  Peas  cleaned, soaked, and rinsed 
 one or two cups each of "thick" and "thin"  coconut milk 
 oil 
 one or two  onions , chopped 
 one hot green  chile   pepper , cleaned and chopped 
 one teaspoon  curry  powderâ€”or  turmeric 
 salt , to taste 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a large pot, combine pigeon  Peas  and just enough  water  to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the  Peas  begin to become tender and most of the  water  is absorbed. 
 Stir in the thin  coconut milk , Continue to simmer over low heat. Add more  water  as necessary to prevent the  Peas  from becoming dry. While  Peas  are simmering: Heat a few tablespoons of  oil  in a skillet. Add the  curry  powder to the  oil  and stir for a minute. Fry the  Onion  and  chile   pepper  until they are tender. 
 Combine the  Peas  and onion- chile  mixture (add either one to the other). Continue to simmer until  Peas  are tender enough to eat. Add the thick  coconut milk  and simmer on the lowest possible heat for five to ten minutes, stirring occasionally.
