 ⅔ cup  cider vinegar 
 4  garlic  cloves, halved

 ¼ cup minced fresh  coriander  plus sprigs for garnish 
 2  scallions , minced 
 dried hot  red pepper flakes  to taste 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan boil the  onions  in just enough salted  water  to cover for 1 minute, drain them, discarding the  water , and return them to the pan with the  vinegar , the  garlic , the peppercorns, the  coriander seeds , the  cumin  seeds, and the  salt . 
 Add just enough  water  to cover the  onions  and boil the mixture for 3 minutes. 
 Transfer the  onion  mixture to a glass bowl and let it stand for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. 
 In a dry 8-inch skillet arrange 1 of the tortillas, sprinkle it with ½ cup of the  Monterey jack , ¼ cup of the  pickled onions , 1 tablespoon of the minced coriander, ¼ of the scallions, and  red pepper flakes  to taste, and top the mixture with another tortilla. 
 Cook the quesadilla over moderate heat for 4 minutes on each side, or until the  cheese  is melted and the tortilla is browned lightly. 
 Cut the quesadilla into 8 wedges and garnish it with about 2 tablespoons of the  pickled onions  and a coriander sprig. 
 Make 3 more quesadillas in the same manner with the remaining tortillas and ingredients.
