 About tonic water : 
 Tonic water  (or Indian tonic water) is a fizzy soft drink flavoured with quinine. The drink gains its name from the medicinal effects of this slightly bitter flavouring.
 The quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of India and Africa where that disease is endemic.
