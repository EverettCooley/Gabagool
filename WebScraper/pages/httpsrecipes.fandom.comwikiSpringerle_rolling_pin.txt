Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Springerle_rolling_pin

 A hardwood rolling pin that is used for the single purpose of making  Springerle  cookies. The shaft of the pin is embossed with symbols that are separated by parallel grooves running around the shaft of the roller. The symbols become embossed into the cookie as the parallel groves form the shape of the cookie when the rolling pin moves over the finished dough.
