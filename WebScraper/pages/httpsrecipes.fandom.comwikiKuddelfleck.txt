 Description : 
 Tripe
 
 Ingredients : 
 750 g boiled  tripe 
 2  eggs 
 flour ,  salt  and  pepper 
 high temperature  oil 
 Sauce : 
 1  shallot 
 2  gherkins 
 2 teaspoons of  capers 
 parsley  and  chives 
 50 g  butter 
 1 heaped tablespoon of  flour 
 Â½ litre broth or meat  stock 
 Elbling 
 Directions : 
 Tripe is available ready boiled at the butcher's shop. Cut it into rectangles of 5 x 8 cm. 
 Take two soup bowls. In one mix the  eggs ,  salt  and  pepper . Put the  flour  in the other. 
 Dip the pieces first in the  egg , and then in the  flour . 
 In the meantime the  oil  has been heated in a pan. 
 The pieces are then fried on both sides until crispy. 
 Put the pieces when cooked on a preheated plate covered with a paper napkin. 
 Sauce : 
 It is best to prepare the sauce prior to frying the tripe. It takes about twenty minutes to cook. 
 Fry the finely chopped shallots in some  butter , and place to one side. 
 Melt the rest of the  butter  on a strong heat. 
 Sieve and stir in the  flour , allowing it to brown. 
 Take the pot from the heat and slowly add the stock, still stirring. 
 Cook for a while longer, stirring occasionally. 
 Add a good slug of Elbling or other dry  white wine . 
 Add the cooked shallots, the gherkins, finely chopped, and the  capers . 
 Season to taste with  salt ,  pepper , and perhaps tabasco. 
 Add the  parsley  and chopped  chives . 
 Serve with boiled  potatoes , and a good Elbling. 
 This dish can equally be prepared with a  tomato sauce .
