INGREDIENTS : 
 Favorite Cake Mix Â or boxed cake mix 
 1 cup powdered sugar 
 4-5 tbsp milk of choice (plus more for thinning) 
 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 
 1/8 tsp cherry extract 
 red and pink food coloring 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Prepare cake as directed and cook according to instructions. Let cool completely so that frosting will stay on cake when drizzled on. 
 Combine powdered sugar, milk, and extracts and smooth. (Adjust extract flavoring to taste.) Add additional milk by the tablespoon until the frosting can be easily drizzled over cake. Divide frosting into three bowls. Color one red, one pink, and leave one white. 
 Take turns drizzling various colors over the cake.
