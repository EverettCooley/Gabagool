Description : 
 Baked cheese pastry
 
 Ingredients : 
 10 – 12 sheets  filo  pastry 
 500 g  white cheese 
 ½ pack  butter  (melted) 
 3 – 4  eggs 
 250 ml  soda water 
 pinch of  salt 
 Directions : 
 Oil a medium size deep oven dish, cover bottom with a sheet of  filo  pastry, sprinkle melted  butter , sprinkle crumbled  white cheese , and continue layering  filo  pastry with  butter  and  cheese . 
 Finish with a layer of  filo  pastry and  butter . 
 In a separate dish beat the  eggs , add  salt , and  soda water . 
 Pour slowly over the dish with the banitza and let it soak in. 
 Cook in a preheated oven (180 – 200°C) for about 40 minutes or until the banitza has risen slightly and has nicely browned on top. 
 Leave to cool for about 30 minutes and serve. 
 I like it with Greek  yoghurt  on the side.
