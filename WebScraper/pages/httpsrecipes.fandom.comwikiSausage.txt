 About Sausage : 
 The Sausage Wiki on Wikia 
 Sausage  refers to ground meat that has been mixed with  spices . It is frequently, although not always, given a tubular shape by being wrapped in a thin membrane. It is also sold as patties and in bulk. The meat can come from any animal, but pork and turkey are the most common.
 Sausages consist of the fresh, cooked, or smoked ground meat that is lightly or strongly seasoned and usually stuffed into casings. Sausage meat is sometimes available loose. Many sausages are just made from pork. Veal sausages such as German  bockwurst , beef, lamb, chicken, and duck sausages are also available.
