 Description : 
 Texas Periwinkle Soup  is similar in taste to clam chowder and the recipe may be individualized to suit personal tastes. It is from Jamaica Beach, Texas, United States.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  chicken stock 
 2  potatoes , diced 
 ½ tsp  tarragon 
 1 tsp  paprika 
 salt  and  pepper 
 2  onions , chopped 
 1 stalk  celery , chopped 
 3 slices  bacon , chopped 
 ½ cup dry  white wine 
 1 cup  milk 
 ¼ cup  butter 
 1½ cup cleaned  periwinkles 
 ½ cup  light cream 
 pinch  cayenne  pepper 
 Directions : 
 In a large soup pot, heat chicken stock, potatoes, tarragon, paprika, salt & pepper. Melt butter in a skillet, and lightly sauté the cleaned Periwinkle meat (see below), onion, celery, and bacon. 
 Add to stock mixture. Stir in wine and simmer until potatoes are cooked. Do not boil. Add milk and cream slowly, stirring constantly; do not boil or it will curdle. Add cayenne. 
 To clean Periwinkles: take a sauce pan full of water and throw in a small amount of salt. Bring to a boil and toss in the snails. Let them simmer for a few minutes, remove and use a toothpick to pull the meat from the shells. The salt water serves to both shrink and toughen the meat, making it easier to remove. Don’t boil them too long or you will end up with a very tough and chewy meal.
