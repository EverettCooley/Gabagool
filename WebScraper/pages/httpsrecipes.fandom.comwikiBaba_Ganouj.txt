Ingredients : 
 2 medium-to-small  eggplants 
 juice from one good sized  lemon 
 ½ cup of  tahini 
 3 cloves of crushed  garlic 
 ½ cup of finely chopped  parsley 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ¼ cup of finely minced  scallions 
 lots of  black pepper 
 1 tsp  olive oil 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut off the stem ends of the  Eggplants  and prick the  Eggplants  all over with a fork. 
 Place them directly on an oven rack and let them roast until they are sagging, wrinkled, crumpled, and totally soft. 
 Remove them gingerly from the oven and wait until they are cool enough to handle. 
 Scoop out their insides and squeeze out the  water  (this removes the bitterness). Mash well. 
 Combine with all other ingredients except the  olive oil . 
 Chill the ganouj completely and drizzle the  oil  over the top just before serving.
