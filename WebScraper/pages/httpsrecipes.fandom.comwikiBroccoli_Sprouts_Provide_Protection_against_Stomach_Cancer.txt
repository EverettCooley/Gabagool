Stomach cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer that kills thousands of people worldwide every year. Recent research has shown that eating a diet rich in broccoli sprouts can provide protection against stomach cancer. Broccoli sprouts contain a larger quantity of phytochemicals (such as sulforaphane) than the mature plant. Sulforaphane is a natural compound that can help destroying cancer-causing agents. The main bacterium responsible for causing stomach cancer and ulcers is Helicobacter pylori. Japanese researches as well as studies that have taken place at the prestigious John Hopkins Medical School in the United States have shown that the sulforaphane compound found in broccoli sprouts can kill Helicobacter pylori, no matter if this bacterium is inside or outside the human cell. Sulforaphane has proven to be even more efficient than commonly used antibiotics in killing the bacteria responsible for stomach cancer. The mechanism used by Sulforaphane to protect the body from stomach cancer consists in stimulating the Nrf-2 gene encoding to produce a large quantity of anti-oxidant enzymes that fight the Helicobacter pylori bacteria. 	
These researches provide good news for the fight against stomach cancer, especially in less developed countries where antibiotics are very expensive and where about 80% of the people are infected with the Helicobacter pylori bacteria. For these people, broccoli sprouts can provide a cheaper and more convenient alternative to common used medicines in the fight against stomach cancer.
