Ingredients : 
 Basic Pizza Dough 
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
 1 cup fat-free bottled pizza sauce 
 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 
 1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated fresh Parmesan cheese 
 How to Make It : 
 Step 1
 Position one oven rack in the middle setting. Position another rack in the lowest setting, and place a rimless baking sheet on the bottom rack. Preheat oven to 500°.
 Step 2
 Remove plastic wrap from Basic Pizza Dough; discard plastic. Brush olive oil over dough. Remove preheated baking sheet from oven, and close oven door. Slide dough onto preheated baking sheet, using a spatula as a guide. Bake on lowest oven rack at 500° for 8 minutes. Remove from oven.
 Step 3
 Spread sauce in an even layer over crust, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake on middle rack an additional 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese melts. Cut into 12 wedges.
