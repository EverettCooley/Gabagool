 1 package Zatarain's Jambalaya mix (seasoned  rice  mix) 
 1 lb  andouille  sausage, diced 
 ½ lb  crabmeat 
 ½ cup  onion , diced 
 1  celery  stalk, diced 
 1  green pepper , diced 
 1  egg 
 2 tablespoons  mayonnaise 
 4 cans  chicken broth 
 ½ stick  butter

 peanut oil 
 Sauce : 
 3 tablespoons  sour cream 
 2 tablespoons  mayonnaise 
 1 tablespoon Zatarain's Creole  Mustard 
 Directions : 
 Sauté sausage, onion, celery, green pepper for about 8 minutes over medium heat. 
 Add chicken broth and jambalaya mix and cook for 25 minutes. 
 Add crabmeat and continue to cook and stir occasionally for 5 minutes. 
 Stir butter into mixture and remove from heat. 
 Store mixture in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 
 Add egg and mayonnaise to mixture. 
 The mixture should be thick by now. 
 Sprinkle flour about ¼ inch thick on a cutting board. 
 Spoon about a tablespoon of the mixture onto the flour to make one cake. 
 Flatten the cake with a spatula, and flip it to dredge the other side in the flour. 
 Heat nonstick skillet and add about ¼ inch of the peanut oil over medium heat. 
 If the oil starts to smoke, it's too hot! fry the cake until golden brown, about 4 minutes for the first side and 3 minutes for the second. 
 Mix sauce ingredients and serve over cakes.
