 Description : 
 
 This recipe is so easy that even my husband can do it. (His specialities are boxed mac-n- Cheese ,  ramen  noodles and frozen pizza!) 
 
 Prep time: 20 minutes 
 Baking time: 55 minutes 
 Crust : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 packages of graham crackers (18 "cracker sheets") 
 1/2 cup (1 stick)  butter  or  margarine 
 Directions : 
 Crush the graham crackers (I put 4 or 5 "cracker sheets" at a time into a sturdy plastic freezer bag and crush them with a rolling pin). 
 Put cracker crumbs into a medium-sized bowl and pour melted  butter / margarine  over the crumbs. 
 Mix thoroughly. 
 Press into a 9x13 ungreased pan. 
 Batter : 
 Ingredients : 
 8 ounces of  cream cheese  (softened) 
 1  egg 
 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened,  condensed milk 
 3 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 1 can (21 ounces) of  blueberry  or  cherry  pie filling 
 Directions : 
 Use an electric mixer to beat the  cream cheese  and  sweetened condensed milk  until smooth (a minute or two). 
 Add the  lemon juice  and  egg  and beat on high speed for another minute. 
 Pour the batter over the graham cracker crust. 
 Drop the canned pie filling into the batter by spoonfuls at evenly-placed intervals. 
 Bake at 300 degrees for 55 minutes. 
 Allow to cool completely before cutting. 
 Store in the refrigerator.
