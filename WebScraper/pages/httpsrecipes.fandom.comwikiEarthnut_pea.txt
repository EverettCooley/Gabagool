 Lathyrus tuberosus, also known as the Tuberous Pea, Earthnut Pea, or Aardaker, is a small, climbing perennial plant, native in moist temperate parts of Europe and western Asia.
 The plant is a trailer or weak climber, supported by tendrils, growing to 1.2 m tall. The leaves are pinnate, with two leaflets and a branched twining tendril at the apex of the petiole. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, pollinated by bees. The plants can also spread vegetatively from the root system.
