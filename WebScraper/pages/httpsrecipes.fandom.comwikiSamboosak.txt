 Description : 
 These flaky meat pies are eaten to break the Muslim fast every evening during the month of Ramadan. To the traditional meat stuffing of the northern Arab states are added  leeks , boiled  eggs , and regional spices.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 package  spring roll skins  (approximately 8 inches square), defrosted 
 1 tbsp  flour 
 1 tbsp  water 
 oil  for frying 
 Filling : 
 1 small  onion , minced 
 1  leek , cleaned and chopped 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 ½ pound  ground beef  or  lamb 
 salt 
 black pepper 
 ½ tsp  cumin  or kebsa spices 
 2  egg whites , hard-boiled and chopped 
 oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the  onions  and  leek  in the  oil  until transparent. 
 Add the meat, sprinkle with  salt  and  pepper , and cook until done, breaking up lumps. 
 Add the  cumin  and the chopped  egg  whites and mix well. 
 Cut each spring roll skin into 3 strips of equal width (if the dough is not precisely square, use the slightly larger dimension for the length of the strip) 
 Lay out 3 to 4 strips on your work surface. 
 Place a rounded tsp. 
 Of the meat mixture toward the bottom right hand corner of each strip. 
 Fold that corner diagonally over to the top left-hand corner, forming a triangle. 
 As you fold, be certain that the side of the strip lines up perfectly with the folded portion. 
 Continue as if folding a flag, alternately folding the bottom corners in a diagonal pattern. 
 Seal the final flap with a bit of the  flour  paste. 
 Deep-fry and drain on absorbent paper.
