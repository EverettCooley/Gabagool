 Description : 
 The following recipe is from "Mother Magyar", by Meryl Constance writing in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article was about Agi Adler, a Jewish lady who emigrated to Australia as a young woman shortly after WWII. Though she didn't know how to cook anything then, let alone Hungarian food, over the years she learned the art. The following recipe comprises part of an Hungarian feast and observes Jewish dietary laws. It looks quite good and is remarkably simple. So good that I typed it in by hand... There was a crease across them that drove my scanner bonkers.
