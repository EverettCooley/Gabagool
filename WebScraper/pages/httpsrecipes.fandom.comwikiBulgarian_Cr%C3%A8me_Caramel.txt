Description : 
 This rich, traditional dessert is infused with vanilla and cinnamon.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 liter  milk 
 8  eggs 
 10 spoonfuls  sugar 
 2 packets  vanilla powder   or  2 teaspoons  vanilla extract 
 a pinch of  cinnamon 
 a spoonful of shredded  lemon peel 
 Directions : 
 Mix the eggs and the milk well. 
 Stir 2/3rds of the sugar in and add the vanilla, cinnamon and lemon peel 
 Try the mixture and if you find it bland, add more  sugar  to taste. 
 Melt the rest of the sugar in a non-stick pan, stirring occasionally so it does not burn. 
 Pour the melted sugar into the 8-12 small pots (cup-size) and rotate each to cover the bottom. 
 Top each with the egg and milk mixture. 
 Place the small pots/cups in a pan with 2-3 cups water, and bake in an oven at 100-150 °C. 
 About thirty minutes later, check to see whether the creme is runny and bake a bit more until a golden crust is formed. 
 Cool the creme, loosen the sides with a spoon, and turn it over on a plate. 
 Serve with a swirl of  whipped cream  on top.
