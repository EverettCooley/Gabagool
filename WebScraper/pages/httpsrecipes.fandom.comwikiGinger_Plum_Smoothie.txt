Ingredients : 
 1 ripe  plum  (fresh or frozen, pitted but not peeled) 
 1/2 cup  orange juice  or other fruit juice 
 1/2 cup plain  yogurt , or 1  banana 
 1 teaspoon grated fresh​  ginger 
 ​
 
 Instructions : 
 Put all of the ingredients in a blender and whirl until smooth. Let the blender run long enough so the mixture is truly pureed. This is especially important when using frozen plums; you need to give them a chance to get processed. 
 Pour the mixture into a glass and enjoy.
