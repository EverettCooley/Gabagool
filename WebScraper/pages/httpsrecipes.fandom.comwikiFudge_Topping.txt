 Description : 
 This topping is good on non-dairy frozen desserts, pancakes and French toast.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2/3 cup thick nut  milk 
 1/3 cup  maple syrup 
 1/4 cup  cocoa  or roasted  carob  powder 
 2 tsp  arrowroot powder 
 1/2 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Blend all ingredients. Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes on medium-low until thickened. Remove from heat and serve hot or chilled over desserts of your choice. 
 
 You can also omit the  arrowroot powder  in this recipe to make a syrup that is great for making  chocolate  non-dairy  milks  and cafe mochas. The mixture will only thicken slightly when cooking. Use 3-4 tbsp of this syrup to flavour 1 cup of chilled soy or nut  milk .
