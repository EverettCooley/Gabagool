 Wikipedia Article  About Lager beer on Wikipedia 
 Pale lager is a family of very pale to golden coloured beers with well attentuated body and noble hop bitterness. The brewing process for this beer family developed in the mid 1800s when Gabriel Sedlmayr took pale ale brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and this technique was picked up by other brewers, most notably Josef Groll who produced Pilsner Urquell.
 Beer that is stored in its cask or vat until free of sediment and crystal clear. It's a light, bubbly, golden brew that ranks as America's most popular.
