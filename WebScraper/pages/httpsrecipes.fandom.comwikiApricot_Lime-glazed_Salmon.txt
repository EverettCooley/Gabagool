 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  apricot fruit spread 
 2 tablespoons  lime juice 
 2 tablespoons chopped  scallions 
 ¼ teaspoon  red pepper flakes 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  canola oil 
 4 x 6 ounce pieces  salmon  fillet 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 425 °F. Wrap foil around the handle of the skillet if it is not ovenproof. 
 Combine the fruit spread, lime juice, scallions and red pepper flakes in a bowl, stirring until the jelly is dissolved. (You can microwave it for a few seconds to make it easier to stir). 
 Sprinkle salt over the fish. 
 Heat the oil over medium high in a skillet large enough to hold the fish in a single layer without crowding. Cook the fish cook 3 minutes on each side, or until golden. 
 Remove from the heat and brush the fish with most of the glaze. 
 Place in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the salmon just turns opaque. 
 Pour the remaining glaze over it and serve immediately.
