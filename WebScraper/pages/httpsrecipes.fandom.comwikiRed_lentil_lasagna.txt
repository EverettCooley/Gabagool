 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  Onion , sliced finely 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 red  chile , deseeded 
 2 stalks  celery , chopped 
 *very* finely (because my 
 wife hates it) 
 1/2 cup  water 
 1 lbs  Broccoli 
 1 small  courgette / zucchini 
 1/2 lbs  Mushroom 
 1 pint  vegetable stock  (vecon and 
 water ) 
 1 cup  red lentils 
 1 can  tomatoes 
 2 tbsp  oregano 
 2 tbsp  basil 
 1/2 tbsp  salt 
 1/2 tbsp  pepper 
 1/2 cup  corn 
 2 tbsp  tomato  puree/paste 
 12 sheets  spinach  lasagna 
 1/4 cup  water 
 2 tbsp  flour 
 3/4 cup  soya milk 
 1 clove  garlic 
 1/4 tbsp  salt 
 1/4 tbsp  pepper 
 3 tbsp  yeast  flakes 
 1/4 tbsp  turmeric 
 Directions : 
 Steam  onions ,  garlic ,  chilli  and  celery  in the half cup of  water . Add stalks of the  Broccoli , the  courgette  and the  Mushrooms  and simmer for about five minutes. Add the stock, the canned  tomatoes , the herbs,  salt  and  pepper , the  Lentils  and the  Broccoli  flowerets. Simmer till the  Lentils  are tender. Add the  corn  and the  tomato  puree. The resulting mixture should be fairly sloppy still because it has to go into the oven for 20 minutes. In another pan stir the  flour  into the cold ¼ cup of  water  till a paste is made. Put on the heat and slowly add the  soya milk  making sure to avoid lumps. Add the crushed clove of  garlic , some  salt  and  pepper , the  yeast  flakes and the  turmeric . You should end up with a pourable cheeze sauce. Layer the mixture with the lasagna sheets (i used no-boil  spinach  lasagna) finishing with a layer of lasagna sheets. Cover with the cheeze sauce and stick in the oven at about 170 deg. C (330 °F) for 20 minutes. Eat with a salad
