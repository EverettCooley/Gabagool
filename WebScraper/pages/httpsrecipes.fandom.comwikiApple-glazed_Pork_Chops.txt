 Original recipe 
 Makes 6 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 6  pork chops , bone-in or boneless  [1] 
 2 tablespoons  oil 
 salt  and  pepper , to taste 
 ½ cup  cider vinegar 
 ½ cup water  [2] 
 ¾ cup granular  Splenda   or  equivalent liquid Splenda 
 1 teaspoon  soy sauce 
 2½ ounces  onion , sliced thin, 1 small 
 ½ teaspoon  xanthan gum 
 Directions : 
 Season pork chops with salt and pepper. 
 Brown on both sides in hot oil in a large nonstick skillet with a lid. 
 Mix vinegar, water, Splenda and soy sauce; pour over chops. 
 Scatter onions on top. 
 Cover and simmer, turning occasionally, 45 minutes. 
 Remove pork chops from pan and keep warm. 
 Lightly sprinkle the xanthan gum over the pan juices and quickly whisk in. 
 Simmer until thickened and serve sauce over chops. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   I had better luck fitting all the pork chops in the pan if I removed the bones first.  
 
 ↑   Instead of the water in the sauce, I used some brewed cranberry apple herbal tea and it gave it a wonderful flavor. Because the cider vinegar has such a strong flavor, the tea didn't really make it taste more like apple, but it gave it a richer, more complex flavor. Simply brew 1 cup of Bigelow Cranberry Apple herbal tea as directed on the package and use ½ cup of the unsweetened tea in place of the water in the recipe. Note that some kinds of apple-flavored herb teas have spices added. This particular flavor does not. It just has a fresh apple flavor.
