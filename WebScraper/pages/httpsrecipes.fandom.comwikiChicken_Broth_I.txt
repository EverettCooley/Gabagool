 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1  Chicken 
 rice 
 1 spoon of  olive oil 
 1  Onion 
 2 peeled, ripe  tomatoes 
 1 clove of  garlic 
 1  laurel leaf 
 1 sprig of  sage 
 pepper 
 salt 
 1 meat stock cube 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  Chicken  into small pieces and thoroughly wash it with  water  and  salt . Then place it in a pot for 2â€“3 hours to marinate in the  salt ,  garlic ,  Onion ,  olive oil , the stock cube, the sprig of  sage  and the  laurel leaf . 
 Then place on the heat, adding sufficient  water  to make a broth taking into account the quantity of  rice . When it starts to boil, add the peeled  tomato  (which has been diced) and the  pepper . 
 If there is too much liquid, increase the heat, which will allow the broth to lose more  water . The secret to making a good broth is to know the quantity of  water  to add for the  rice . 
 Serve in a bowl with a sprig of  sage  and, for those who like it, with  pepper  sprinkled on the top.
