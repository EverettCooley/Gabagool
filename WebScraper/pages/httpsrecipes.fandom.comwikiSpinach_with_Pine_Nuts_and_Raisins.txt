 Description : 
 spinach  with  pine nuts  and  Raisins  is a classic Sephardic dish that appears on tables in Greece, Spain,  Turkey , and Italy, where it is a staple on Venetian and Genoese menus. It is a perfect accompaniment to delicate Or poultry dishes and is often served at room temperature.

 Rinse the  spinach  well and remove the stems. 
 Place in a large sauté pan with only the rinsing  water  clinging to the leaves. 
 Cook over medium heat, turning as needed until wilted, just a few minutes. 
 Drain well and set aside.
