 Description : 
 This golden, tangy marinade has three ingredients - sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ginger - and is often used for meat, poultry, and seafood. This is normally great for grilling, roasting, or frying, as it only keeps a bold, natural aroma with the oils, ginger, honey, and condiments.
