 About Seakale : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Seakale on Wikipedia 
 Seakale is a halophytic perennial plant that grows wild along the coasts of Europe, from the North Atlantic to the Black Sea. It has large fleshy glaucous collard-like leaves and abundant white flowers. The seeds come one each in globular pods.
 The plant is sometimes grown as an ornamental but its most common use is as a blanched vegetable. In the spring the plants are covered with soil or with a pot or box. They then produce thick blanched leaf stalks, each topped with a small leaf. These are used in a similar manner to asparagus. Although it naturally grows very close to the ocean, it can be raised in ordinary garden soil. Plants come readily from seed and also from root cuttings.
 Seakale is more commonly used in Europe and only rarely grown in the United States.
