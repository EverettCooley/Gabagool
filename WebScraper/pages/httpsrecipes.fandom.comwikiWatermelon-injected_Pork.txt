 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds  pork tenderloin 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Marinade : 
 3 cups diced  watermelon  meat (approximately, to yield 2 cups juice) 
 3  jalapeños  (leave jalapeños ribs and seeds in for maximum heat; remove for less) 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 2 cups  granulated sugar 
 ¼ cup  Midori  liqueur (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Marinade : 
 Seed and then purée watermelon and jalapeños in a blender. 
 Strain mixture through a sieve and return to the blender. 
 If you won't inject the tenderloin, no need to strain marinade. 
 Add salt, sugar and midori liqueur. 
 Blend for 2 minutes. 
 Reserve 1 cup for basting. 
 Pork : 
 Draw marinade into syringe-type injector. 
 Poke and inject marinade throughout tenderloin. 
 After marinating, season the meat with salt and pepper. 
 Have coals prepared on the grill and use the combination technique of direct and indirect heat: roll the tenderloin over the direct heat to establish grill marks and then move to a slower part of the grill to finish cooking without burning. 
 With gas grills, turn front burners on high to establish grill marks, and then move to the back. 
 Baste the tenderloin periodically while cooking. 
 Cook the tenderloin to an internal temperature of 145°F (despite your mother's warnings to cook pork to 170°F, 137°F will kill off anything that might harm you). 
 Allow the meat to rest 5 minutes and then slice into medallions. 
 Notes : 
 A food injector can be found in local food stores. For best results, inject the meat the day before and store in an airtight plastic bag with extra marinade. If you don't have an injector, poke a few holes with a fork in the pork and just marinate tenderloin overnight
