Description : 
 Delicious and easy. Great for an appetizer buffet. From dailyrecipe.com, I believe. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 (1.8 ounces) package dried vegetable soup mix 
 ½ cup  mayonnaise 
 ½ cup  sour cream  (light is ok) 
 2 (8 ounces) packages refrigerated  crescent dinner rolls  (reduced-fat OK) 
 1 (10 ounces) package frozen chopped  spinach , thawed and drained 
 1 (8 ounces) can  water   chestnuts , drained 
 1 (14 ounces) can  artichoke  hearts, drained 
 4 ounces  feta  cheese, crumbled 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ¼ cup grated  parmesan cheese 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375°F. 
 Unroll the packages of crescent dough on a 15x10" jelly roll pan. 
 Lay them side by side, and press perforations together on bottom and up the sides of the pan, to form a crust. 
 Bake for about 10 minutes, or until light golden brown. 
 Combine dry soup mix,  mayonnaise  and  sour cream  in a medium bowl. 
 Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the thawed  spinach , and add to the soup mixture. 
 Chop (or pulse in a food processor) the  artichoke  hearts and  water   chestnuts . 
 (chop to a medium coarseness - not too fine). 
 Add artichokes,  water   chestnuts ,  garlic  and  feta  cheese to soup mixture; combine thoroughly. 
 Spread evenly over the crust. 
 Sprinkle evenly with the  Parmesan cheese . 
 Bake 10 – 12 minutes, or until heated through.
