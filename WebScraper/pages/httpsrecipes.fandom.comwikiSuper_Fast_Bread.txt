Super Fast Bread
 3 cups Flour
1 2/3 cups; water, cold
1 tsp Salt
1 tbsp Yeast, dry
1 tbsp Honey
 HEAT 3 cups of flour for 2 minutes in the microwave. While that's happening,
measure the water. Add salt, dry yeast and a tablespoon of honey. It looks
like a mess, but don't worry about it.
 
 QUICKLY take the hot flour and mix in the water combo with an electric
mixer. It should be sticky and gooey. If your mixer is having trouble, just
add more water. Mix it around as long as you want.
 
 NOW, cover it, put it in a cool place, go away and ignore it. Go to work,
take a walk, go to sleep, whatever. If you happen to pass the poor neglected
thing during the day, pound it around a little with a wet spoon. If you are
going to ignore it for more than 8 hours, put it in the refrigerator. If you
are in a hurry, ignore the ignoring part and proceed to the next step.
 
 POUND your sticky dough around with a wet spoon to pop all the bubbles, then
slop it into a well oiled bread pan.
 
 SET a timer and let the dough rise in a warm spot for 10 minutes. If it was
kept in the refrigerator, let it sit a little longer. Set your timer again
for 10 minutes and turn on your oven at 350 degrees. When it's hot, bake
bread for 50 minutes.
