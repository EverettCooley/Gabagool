 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  black beans 
 2 tbsp extra-virgin  olive oil 
 2  onions , large, diced 
 6 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 cup  tomato , peeled, seeded, and chopped (fresh or canned) 
 1 sprig  epazote , fresh or dried (optional) 
 1 tbsp  chipotle chiles , canned, chopped (or ¼ tsp  cayenne ) 
 1 tsp  cumin , ground 
 1 tsp  coriander , ground 
 2 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  black beans  for 2 hours and drain. 
 In a deep pot, heat the  olive oil  over medium heat. 
 Add the  onions  and cook about 5 minutes. 
 Until translucent. 
 Add the  beans ,  garlic , and 6 cups cold  water . 
 Bring to a boil, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. 
 Reduce to a simmer. 
 In an hour or when the  beans  are soft, add the  tomato ,  epazote , chipotle  chile ,  cumin , coriander, and  salt . 
 Continue cooking until the  beans  start to break down and the broth begins to thicken. 
 Taste for seasoning and add  salt  and  pepper  if needed. 
 If you’re serving this soup immediately, you may want to thicken it by puréeing a cup or two of the  beans  in a blender or food processor and then recombining them with the rest of the soup. 
 The soup will thicken on its own if refrigerated overnight.
