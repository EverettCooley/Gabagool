 2   INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 
 INGREDIENTS : 
 CRUST : 
 2 1/4 cups flour 
 1 cup butter 
 1/2 tsp salt 
 4 to 6 tbsp water, cold 
 ELDERBERRY PIE FILLING : 
 4 cups elderberries, stemmed 
 1 cup sugar 
 3-4 tbsp corn starch 
 (or tapioca starch) 
 2 tbsp lemon juice 
 1/2 cup water (see note) 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Prepare the pie crust by mixing flour and salt (with a tbsp of sugar if desired) and then cutting the butter into the flour mixture until crumbly. Add water and bring the mixture together into a cohesive mass. Divide into two pieces, wrap and refrigerate. 
 Clean and stem the elderberries. 
 Place the sugar, cornstarch and water in a saucepan large enough to hold all the filling. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve. 
 Add elderberries and lemon juice and cook another 2-3 minutes until heated through. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the crust. 
 Remove one half of the crust from the refrigerator, roll it out and use it to line a pie pan.Â  
 Fill the crust with the elderberry pie filling, and then top with the second half of the crust (as a lattice top or solid top pie). 
 Seal the edges, and optionally, pain the top with milk or egg white for a golden crust. A sprinkle of sugar on top is also a nice decorative touch. 
 Bake at 425 for 30 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 for an additional 20 to 30 minutes until the crust is browned and filling bubbly. 
 Allow the pie to cool completely before cutting.
