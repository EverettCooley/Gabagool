 1/2 cup fine  cornmeal 
 21/2 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 1/4 cup  granulated sugar 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold  unsalted butter 
 1 extra-large  egg 
 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbs.  heavy cream  or half-and-half 
 Filling 
 2 red  Apples 
 1 green  Apple , preferably Granny Smith 
 1  Pear , preferably Bosc or Anjou 
 2 Tbs. fresh  lemon juice 
 1 Tbs. grated  lemon  zest 
 1 Tbs.  cornstarch 
 1 tsp.  cinnamon 
 1/4 tsp.  nutmeg 
 1/4 cup  brown sugar 
 1/4 cup  granulated sugar 
 1/4 tsp.  salt 
 1/2 cup fresh or frozen  cranberries , or more as desired 
 Directions : 
 To make pastry: 
 Combine  cornmeal ,  flour ,  Sugar  and  salt  in food processor fitted with steel blade. 
 Use sharp knife to cut  butter  into thin slices while still cold, then lay  butter  on top of dry ingredients in food processor. 
 Pulse several times until  butter  is evenly distributed and mixture resembles coarse meal. 
 Add  egg  and pulse once or twice until just incorporated, then pulse in enough  cream  to bring dough together. Remove dough from food processor and press together into one mass. 
 Divide dough into 2 uneven pieces, about two-thirds and one-third. 
 Form each into ball, and flatten each ball into thick disk. 
 Place each disk between 2 sheets of wax paper, and roll until about 1/8 inch thick. 
 Ease larger circle into 9- or 10-inch pie pan and trim edges. 
 Cut smaller circle into strips about 1/2 inch wide. 
 Preheat oven to 375F. 
 To make filling: 
 Slice  Apples  and  Pear  thinly. 
 Transfer to bowl and drizzle with  lemon  or  lime juice  and toss with grated  lemon  zest. 
 Combine  cornstarch ,  cinnamon ,  nutmeg , sugars and  salt  in bowl, sprinkle onto fruit and toss to coat. 
 Arrange fruit in crust so skins show, and sprinkle  cranberries  over top. 
 Arrange dough strips on top in criss-cross pattern to form lattice topping. 
 Place filled tart on baking tray and bake in lower half of oven about 40 minutes, or until light golden on top and around edges. 
 Cool at least 15 minutes before slicing tart. Serve warm or at room temperature.
