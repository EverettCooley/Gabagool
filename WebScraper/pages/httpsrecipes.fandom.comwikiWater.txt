 Water  is both added to food as an ingredient and used to transfer heat for cooking.
 For both such purposes, the water should be generally drinkable. Water is a common source of disease organisms.  Boiling  water for about 5 minutes should take care of this problem. Baked goods containing water also need to be kept at a boiling temperature to prevent the spread of disease.
 Water-based cooking methods include:
 
 blanching 
 boiling 
 poaching 
 simmering 
 steaming 
 
 Water for fermenting : 
 When adding water to a  fermented food , it is generally best to use water with little or no chlorine. Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful microbes such as bacteria, and as such, can change how well a fermentation progresses, by slowing it down or even by ruining it.
 Commercial  yeast  ferments like  beer  are not as sensitive to chlorine as yeast / bacteria ferments like  sourdough , but often still benefit from chlorine-free water as it also affects the taste of the final product.
 Chlorine can be removed from tap water by boiling for a few minutes and leaving to cool. Also, leaving uncovered overnight (e.g. in the  refrigerator ) will reduce chlorine. However, some water suppliers are now using the more stable chloramine instead, which cannot be boiled out and will remain stable in water for longer periods. Many water filters will remove both chlorine and chloramine.
