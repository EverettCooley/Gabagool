 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1  Potato , thinly sliced (peel 
 or don't peel) 
 Directions : 
 Spray a dinner plate with pam. Place  Potato  slices on plate in a single row. Microwave on high for 4 minutes. Turn slices over and continue to microwave on high another 3 to 5 minutes.  potatoes  are done when they are lightly browned - if they aren"t browned, they won"t get crisp. This may take longer depending on your microwave"s wattage but you will be safe with the initial 4 minutes of cooking. You need to watch them carefully after that. Now comes the hard part . Remove from plate and toss in a bowl with  salt  or seasoning of your choice and let cool! it is important to let them cool so they can crisp up. This recipe makes a small amount but i think these are tastier than the commercial fatfree chips. I haven"t had such good luck doing this with  sweet potatoes  unfortunately
