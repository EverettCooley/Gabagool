 Cook Time : 30 minutes 
 Serves : 4 
 Ingredients 
 
 4 skinless and boneless  chicken  breast halves (about 1 pound) 
 4 teaspoons  vegetable oil 
 3 cups mushrooms, sliced (i.e.  button ,  portobello ,  cremini , or  porcini ) 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 ¾ cup dry  marsala  wine 
 ½ cup  green onions , sliced 
 ½ teaspoon dried  sage , crushed 
 1 tablespoon water 
 1 teaspoon  cornstarch 
 Directions 
 Tenderize breast halves by placing each between two sheets of plastic wrap then pound lightly using the flat side of a meat mallet until about ⅛” in thickness. 
 Heat 2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook mushrooms for 4 minutes or until tender. 
 Remove from heat and set aside. 
 Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the chicken. 
 Using the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil over medium-high heat then add chicken and cook for about 2–3 minutes, turning once and no longer pink inside (cook longer if necessary to ensure doneness) 
 Remove cooked chicken and set aside. 
 In the same skillet, stir in the marsala wine to the leftover pan drippings, scraping up any browned bits then bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium. 
 Stir in cooked mushrooms, green onions and sage. 
 In a small bowl, combine water and cornstarch and mix thoroughly with a fork then add to the marsala sauce. 
 Cook and stir until slightly thickened for about 1 minute. 
 Serve chicken topped with marsala sauce and mushrooms.
