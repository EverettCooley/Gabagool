 Description : 
 From my Great Aunt Ludieâ€™s Collection. The notation on card said this was a family favorite. Dated 1932. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 pounds  Chicken 
 6 peppercorns 
 1  bay leaf 
 1  parsley  stalk 
 1 sprig of fresh  thyme 
 1  Onion 
 1  carrot 
 1  celery  stalk 
 1/2  green pepper , finely shred 
 1/2 red pepper, finely shred 
 1/2 yellow  pepper , finely shred 
 8 ounces bow tie  Pasta , cooked 
 1-teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1/2 small  Onion  finely diced 
 2 teaspoons  vegetable oil 
 1-tablespoon  curry  powder 
 1/2 cup  white wine 
 2 tablespoons  water 
 1-1/2 cups  Mayonnaise 
 2 tablespoons warm  water 
 3 tablespoon  curry  flavoring 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1-teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 Poach  Chicken  by placing in a large pot with enough cold  water  to barely cover. 
 Add peppercorns,  bay leaf ,  parsley ,  thyme ,  Onion ,  carrot  and  celery  cut into quarters. 
 Bring to a bare boil with lid on; reduce heat to low and simmer for 50 minutes. 
 Cool in poaching liquid, then drain, skin and shred. 
 To make  curry  flavoring, soften diced  Onion  in hot  oil , then add  curry  powder and cook over medium-high heat for a further 3 minutes. 
 Add wine and  water . 
 Boil rapidly until reduced to about 3 tablespoons. 
 Strain and let cool. 
 Prepare  curry   Mayonnaise  by combining all ingredients until smooth. 
 Place  peppers  in a large bowl (reserving a little for garnish), with  Chicken ,  Pasta ,  salt ,  pepper  and  curry   Mayonnaise . 
 Mix gently until well coated. 
 If  Mayonnaise  mixture is too thick, add warm  water  gradually until a smooth consistency is attained. 
 Place a portion of salad on bed of  spinach  and sprinkle reserved  peppers  on top. 
 Assemble just before serving, as the  Mayonnaise  quickly loses its fresh look.
