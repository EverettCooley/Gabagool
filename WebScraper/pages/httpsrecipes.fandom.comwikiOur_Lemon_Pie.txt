 3 tbsp  margarine 
 10  graham cracker  squares 
 ½ cup skimmed  evaporated milk , cold 
 1 pack  Dream Whip 
 27 pack Equal  sweetener 
 2  egg yolks 
 2 large  lemons , ½ cup juice 
 3  egg whites 
 3 tbsp  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Melt  margarine  on medium to low heat. 
 Roll graham crackers into crumbs with rolling pin. 
 Mix crumbs and melted  margarine . 
 Pat to make crust on bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill. 
 Add cold  evaporated milk  to  dream whip  (do not add  vanilla ). 
 Sprinkle in 24 pkg. Equal. 
 Mix and beat according to directions. 
 Beat  egg yolks  slightly, and gradually stir in  lemon juice . 
 Gradually fold in the whipped  dream whip . 
 Spread in pie crust. 
 Turn on broiler so it will get hot. 
 Beat 3  egg whites  frothy (use clean beaters so whites will beat up as fluffy as possible). 
 Add 1 tbsp  sugar  and beat until blended in. 
 Add another tbsp  sugar  and 3 equal pkg. and beat until soft peaks form. 
 Spread meringue over top. 
 Spread meringue to stick to the edges so it won't shrink when you broil it. 
 Put under broiler for 30 – 60 seconds until meringue is lightly browned. It doesn't take long at all and is easy to burn. The flavors will blend better if you chill for 5 hours.
