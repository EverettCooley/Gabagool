Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  potatoes 
 2 tablespoons  margarine 
 2 tablespoons  flour 
 ½ cup  soya milk 
 1 tablespoon  garlic powder 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 Boil  water  and cook  potatoes  until semi soft (easy to cut and will bake faster). 
 Preheat oven to 400°F. 
 While  potatoes  are boiling melt vegan  margarine  on med/low in sauce pan. 
 Once  margarine  is melted stir in  flour  and  garlic powder  to make a paste. 
 Then stir in  soya milk  until it reaches a thick sauce like texture and let simmer a minute or 2 but do not let thicken back to paste and remove from heat. 
 Slice  potatoes  into rounds and place in side oven safe container. 
 Mix in fake  cheese  sauce and put thick layer on top of  potatoes . 
 At this point you may also sprinkle on soya parmasan if desired. 
 Bake in oven for 10-15mins keeping close eye to make sure it doesn't burn — you want the sauce to bubble and thicken a little. 
 Then turn the oven up to broil and broil the top of the  potatoes  until they are golden brown. Enjoy!
