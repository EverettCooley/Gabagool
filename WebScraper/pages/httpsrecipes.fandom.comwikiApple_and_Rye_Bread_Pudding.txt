 5½ cups cubed fresh  or  stale sourdough, wheat, or  rye bread 
 ½ cup  raisins 
 1 tbsp  caraway seeds   or   anise seeds 
 5 cups diced  apples 
 ½ cup  apple butter 
 1 tbsp  sunflower butter   or   tahini 
 1 cup  water 
 2 tbsp mellow  or   sweet miso 
 2 cup amazake beverage (original)  or   vanilla   soy milk 
 Directions : 
 Cube  bread  and toss in a large bowl with  raisins  and  caraway seeds . 
 Stale  bread  may be used instead of fresh. 
 Toss  apples  in a bowl with  bread  cubes. 
 Combine  apple  and sunflower  butter  (or tahini), 1 cup  water ,  miso , amazake or  soy milk , then pour liquid mixture over  apples  and  bread . 
 Stir to coat. 
 Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish or two 9-inch pie plates or cake pans. 
 Cover with lid (oven-proof). 
 Allow mixture to sit for 2 to 4 hours before baking so  bread  will soak up flavors. 
 Bake covered at 350 °F for 1 hour or until slightly firm and mixture pulls away from sides slightly. 
 Then remove from oven and spoon into individual dessert cups, an  ice cream  scooper works well. 
 Allow to cool slightly and then serve.
