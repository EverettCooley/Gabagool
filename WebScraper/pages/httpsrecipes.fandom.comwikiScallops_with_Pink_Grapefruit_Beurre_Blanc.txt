 Ingredients : 
 ¾ pound sea  scallops 
 1 tablespoon  flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 ¼ cup dry  white wine 
 2 tablespoons bottled  clam juice 
 1 tablespoon minced  shallot 
 ⅓ cup fresh pink  grapefruit juice 
 ½ teaspoon grated pink grapefruit  zest 
 ½ teaspoon granulated  sugar 
 3 tablespoons cold  unsalted butter  cut into bits 
 1 tablespoon thinly sliced  scallion 
 fresh pink  grapefruit  sections for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Pat sea scallops dry and cut them into ½-inch-thick slices. 
 In a bowl toss together the scallops, flour, salt and pepper. 
 In a skillet large enough to hold the scallops in one layer heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the scallops stirring for 3 minutes. 
 Transfer scallops to a plate. 
 Add the wine to the skillet scraping up the brown bits and stir in the clam juice, shallot, grapefruit juice, zest and sugar. 
 Boil the liquid until it is reduced to about ⅓ cup and strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a saucepan. 
 Set the pan over low heat and whisk in the butter a little at a time lifting the pan from the heat occasionally to cool the mixture and adding each new bit of butter before the previous one has melted completely. 
 Add the scallion and the scallops with any juices that have accumulated on the plate and heat the mixture until the scallops are heated through. 
 Divide the mixture between 2 plates and garnish each plate with some of the grapefruit sections.
