 Description : 
 Small loaves of churek sweetened with honey are eaten filled with cheese or walnuts.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 package of  dry active yeast 
 1 tablespoon of  honey 
 2¼ cups of lukewarm water (110 to 115°F.) 
 6 cups of  all-purpose flour 
 ¼ pound of  unsalted butter , melted 
 1 tablespoon of  salt 
 2 tablespoons of white  sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar into ¼ cup of the lukewarm water in a small, shallow bowl. Let it stand 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the bowl aside in a warm, draft-free spot (such as unlighted oven) for about 5 to 1 minutes, or until the mixture almost doubles in volume. 
 Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. 
 Pour in the yeast mixture, remaining water, melted butter, honey and salt. With a large spoon, beat the flour into the liquid ingredients, continuing to beat for as long as 10 minutes, or until a soft, spongy dough is formed. 
 Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm draft-free spot until the mixture doubles in volume. 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and divide in into 10 equal parts. Roll out each part ad thinly as possible into circles, then place 2 or 3 circles on a cookie sheet. 
 Sprinkle lightly with cold water and a few sesame seeds and set the cookie sheet on the floor of the oven. 
 Bake about 20 minutes, or until the bread is pale golden brown. Transfer the breads with a wide spatula to a wire rack and bake the remaining rounds similarly. 
 The bread will keep several days at room temperature if wrapped securely in foil.
