Description : 
 Makes plenty for 4-6 hungry people. Recipe can be halved. I got this soup recipe off this group, but unfortunately lost the name of the author. It's really wonderful! the only comment is that i use less  water  when making  cream  sauces than is suggested here.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 med  eggplant 
 1½ lbs  mushrooms , cut into thick slices (⅓ – ½ in.) (I used  button  and  cremini  didn't care for the  shiitake  though) 
 ⅔ cup homemade soup mix plus 2 cups  water   or  2 cans low fat  cream of mushroom  soup 
 4 cloves crushed  garlic  (or to taste) 
 1 tbsp  paprika  (or to taste, I use more!) 
 1 tbsp  nutmeg  (or to taste) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 ¼ cup each  balsamic vinegar 
 white wine  for sauteing 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  eggplant  into thick slices (can leave skin on, if desired) salted the slices, and let them drain for about half an hour or so. Pat them dry with a paper towel, then cut into bite-sized chunks. (the salting/draining helps keep the  eggplant  from getting  bitter ). 
 In a cup, mix equal parts of  balsamic vinegar  and  white wine  for sauteing. 
 Add crushed  garlic  to this mixture, and use this to saute  eggplant  until it is nice and soft (15-20 minutes at medium heat). 
 Remove  eggplant , and saute  mushrooms  in remaining  vinegar /wine mixture until they release their juices. 
 Stir in  eggplant , then add soup mix and  water  (or canned soup, if using that). 
 Add  paprika ,  nutmeg ,  salt  and  pepper  to taste, and cook 5-6 minutes until sauce has thickened and veggies are heated through. 
 Add additional  water  if sauce is too thick, and do not overcook. 
 Serve over  rice  or  fettucine  noodles.
