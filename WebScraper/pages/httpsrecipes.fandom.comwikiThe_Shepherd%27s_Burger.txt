 Description : 
 A different take on a classic, the Shepherd's burger features a ground herb infused lamb patty tucked in between a Panini bread, garnished with sauteed leeks.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Panini bread  (sufficient to make 1 burger) 
 Sage 
 Thyme 
 Ground  lamb  (1/5 lb) 
 Salt 
 Pepper 
 Leek 
 Arugula 
 Sliced  tomato  (I prefer Campari ) 
 Directions : 
 Prepare the ground lamb by adding finely chopped Sage, Thyme and salt and pepper. Mould it into a patty. 
 Sauté the Leeks in a pan and keep aside 
 Cook the lamb patty on a grill (or saucepan if one is absent) 
 Place the lamb patty in between the heated up Panini bread and add the Sauteed Leeks on top, in between a bed of Arugula and sliced tomatoes. 
 Enjoy :)
