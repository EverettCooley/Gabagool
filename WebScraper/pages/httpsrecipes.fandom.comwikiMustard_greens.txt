 Wikipedia Article  About Mustard greens on Wikipedia 
 An American salad green with frilly leaves and medium to hot mustard flavor. Often picked when young, when the flavor is at its mildest. 
 This dark leaf vegetable has a peppery flavor similar to mustard. It can be found year round either fresh or frozen. When fresh, the leaves should be crisp and dark green with no yellow or pitting. The greens should be washed and deveined before use and may be cooked like other leafy dark greens such as spinach or collard greens. They will keep up to week in the refrigerator.
