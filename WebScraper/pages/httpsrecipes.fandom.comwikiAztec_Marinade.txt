Description : 
 In this recipe the tartness of the key- limes  plays very well off the warm flavor of the  cocoa powder  and  chili powder . Since I first made it I've tweeked it just a little but now I think it's more or less just right. The  brown sugar  and  thyme  are reminiscent of Caribbean cooking themes. Mild  chili powder  may be used if you don't want it to be too spicy; alternatively, if you want a spicier dish use more  chili powder ! You can store this marinade in the freezer prior to using, but once it has been used it should be discarded to prevent spoiling.
