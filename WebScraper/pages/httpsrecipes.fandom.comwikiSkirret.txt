 About Skirret : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Skirret on Wikipedia 
 The Skirret (Sium sisarum Apiaceae), is a root vegetable. It has a cluster of sweet, bright white roots which are similar to sweet potatoes, but longer (15-20 cm). Skirrets may be boiled, stewed, or roasted. The woody core is inedible, and should be removed before cooking because it is difficult to remove after.
 The skirret is of Chinese origin, and has been grown in Europe since around 1500. It is not commonly grown in North America today.
 The plant grows about 1 m high and is very resistant to cold, as well as pests and diseases. It is usually grown from seeds, but may also be started from root divisions. Lack of moisture makes the root more fibrous.
