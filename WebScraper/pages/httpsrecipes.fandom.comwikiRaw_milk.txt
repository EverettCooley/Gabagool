 Wikipedia Article  About Raw milk on Wikipedia 
 Raw milk is milk that has not been processed via pasteurization (heating) or homogenization before consumption by humans. The taste is different, and so is the digestability. There is no consensus as to whether it is more healthful or less, compared to regular milk.
