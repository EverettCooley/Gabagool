 Makes 4 servings (½ pepper per serving) 
 Ingredients : 
 10 ounces 93% extra-lean  ground beef 
 ½ cup finely chopped  onion 
 1 can (4 ounces) mild chopped  green chilies 
 ½ cup frozen  corn  kernels 
 ¼ cup  cornmeal 
 ½ of 8-ounce can  tomato sauce , divided use 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2 large  green bell peppers , split in half lengthwise, seeds and stem removed (about 8 ounces each) 
 2 ounces shredded, reduced-fat sharp  cheddar  cheese (⅔ cup) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375°F. 
 Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. 
 Cook beef until browned. 
 Remove skillet from heat and drain beef on paper towels. 
 Return beef to skillet. 
 Add onion, chilies, corn, cornmeal, ¼ cup tomato sauce, cumin and salt. Mix well. 
 Arrange peppers, cut side up, in a 12 x 8-inch baking pan. 
 Spoon equal amounts of the beef mixture into each pepper half. 
 Spoon remaining ¼ cup tomato sauce evenly over each pepper half. Pepper halves will be very full. 
 Bake, uncovered, 35 minutes or until peppers are tender. 
 Sprinkle each pepper half with equal amounts of the cheese (cheese does not have to melt). 
 Serve immediately or cool and freeze. 
 To freeze, place each pepper half in 1-quart freezer resealable plastic food storage bags. 
 Release any excess air from bags and seal. 
 Freeze bags flat for easier storage and faster thawing. 
 To reheat, open the food storage bag and place on a microwave-safe plate. 
 Cook on high for 3 to 3½ minutes or until hot. 
 Remove from bag and place on plate.
