Ingredients : 
 2 boxes (about 600Â grams) soft  tofu  (regular or silken) 
 12 ounces pure, unsweetened  baking chocolate 
 1/2 to 1 cup of pure  maple syrup 
 Directions : 
 Let  tofu  sit on the counter until it's at room temperature. 
 Melt the  chocolate  in a double boiler, or in a saucepan over medium-low heat. 
 Place the room-temperature  tofu  in your blender or food processor, and add the  maple syrup  (start with a 1/2 cup and adjust as you blend to your desired sweetness). 
 Turn the blender or processor on to low speed and begin slowly pouring in the melted  chocolate . 
 Once the  chocolate  is mixed in and there are no lumps in the mousse, taste test and adjust the sweetness to your tastes. If you add more  maple syrup , be sure to process well. 
 Chill in your fridge for about 15 minutes, or until completely cool. 
 Top each serving with  tofu   whipped cream , a whole, fresh  strawberry  and a sprinkling of 100% pure  chocolate shavings , and you're sure to win some hearts.
