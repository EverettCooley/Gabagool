 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Chicken base  can be found in the spice section. I used Schilling's  Chicken  flavor base. Spice islands also has a product called  chicken  flavor stock base that is probably the same thing. I would like to give credit to Scott Hammon, whose extra efforts succeeded in wrangling this recipe from Baby Doe's chef. Since it's been many years since I sampled this soup at the restaurant in Dallas, I can't judge how closely this approximates the original. But at least the results are tasty! hope all who try it will enjoy it.
