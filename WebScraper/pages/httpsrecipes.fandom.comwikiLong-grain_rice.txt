 About Long-grain rice : 
 Long grain rice kernels are three times longer than they are wide what means that are more than 6 mm. When cooked, this grain is light and separates easily. There are as well gelatinous long grain rice in Thailand where are native. It contains much less niacin, thiamin, magnesium, zinc, iron and fiber than the brown rice. White rice may be covered with magnesium silicate or with a mixture consisting of talc and glucose which is also known as talc-coated rice. It is indispensable in Hindu cooking, and has a light and dry texture and an aromatic taste. This type of rice is cultivated in India and Pakistan. Long-grain rice has the most amylose and the smallest amount of amylopectin, so it has a propensity to be the fluffiest and least sticky. Amylose also hardens more when is fresh, combination strongly together and forming crystals that melt when the rice is reheated. Rice that is high in amylose has a lower Glycerin index number. Amylopectin is a highly divided molecule that makes the rice humid when it's released from the grain during cooking.
