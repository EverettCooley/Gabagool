 Bake 30 minutes. 
 Baste with pan juices and then drizzle with  honey . 
 Bake 15 to 20 minutes more, or until cooked through. 
 Notes : 
 Use bone-in  chicken breasts  instead of  chicken  legs. 
 The spice mix is also nice to rub on roasting  chicken  or  pork  loin or leg roasts. 
 Drizzle such roasts with the  honey  near the end of cooking so it does not scorch.
