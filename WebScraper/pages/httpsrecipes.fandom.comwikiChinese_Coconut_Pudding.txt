Here is the recipe for the lusciously light, snow-white, squares of  coconut  pudding that is served at Chinese dim sum. Simple to make and delicious! Because of the risk of salmonella in raw  egg  whites, I would substitute the appropriate amount of pasteurized  egg whites , or  egg  whites reconstituted from a powder." Original recipe yield: 8 servings.
