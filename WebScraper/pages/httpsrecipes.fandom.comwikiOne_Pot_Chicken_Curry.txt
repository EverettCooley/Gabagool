One Pot Chicken Curry  sounds too good to be true, until you sink your taste buds in it! Just put the stuff in a pot and it's ready to go. Compatible with crockpots.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 Chicken (canned, or leftover) 
 Milk (dairy, almond, soy, whatever) 
 Vegetables of choice (carrots, corn, peas, peppers, etc) 
 Curry Powder, black pepper, salt, other seasonings 
 Leftover rice 
 Hot sauce (optional) 
 Thinkener, like cornstarch 
 Steps : 
 Place a pot on the burner and turn the heat on, no further than 5. 
 In the pot, add chicken, milk, vegetables, and curry powder. Stir and set aside. 
 When it starts to boil, keep stirring. You may add in the thickener at this time. 
 Turn off the stove and get out some leftover rice. You can even mix rice into the curry!
