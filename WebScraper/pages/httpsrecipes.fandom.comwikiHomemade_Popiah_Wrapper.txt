 1 large  egg , lightly beaten 
 525 ml  water

 Sift together the dry ingredients.

 Knead the dough. 
 It should have a bouncy texture, and should stick to your hand. 
 Heat up a wok, without  oil , and make sure to use a non stick pan, as it is easier. 
 When the wok is hot, spread the dough around the wok in a thin layer (use your hand as the dough is still sticking to it).
