 1 teaspoon ground  coriander

 Directions : 
 Pound beans or put them through a blender until they are very smooth. 
 Put all remaining ingredients in except the water, flour, sesame seeds and oil. 
 Mix well and leave to stand at least 15 minute but preferably an hour. 
 After the mix has rested take small amounts and make round cakes about 2 inches in diameter and ¾ inch thick. 
 Add a little flour and water if they are not sticking together well. 
 Let the cakes rest another 15 minutes then press a few sesame seeds on the top of each. 
 Heat oil in a pan and brown the ta'amia a few minutes of each side until golden brown. 
 Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot with pita bread, yogurt and slices of tomato and cucumber.
