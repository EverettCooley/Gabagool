Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Oyster_cracker

A small, hollow, hard-textured cracker most often served as an accompaniment to chowders, soups and stews. Puffy in appearance, the oyster cracker is very similar to a soda cracker or saltine. It is typically made with wheat flour, shortening, yeast, and seasonings and shaped into a round or six-sided form. In addition to serving this cracker plain, it works well as a cracker that can be seasoned with herbs and other ingredients to be served as a tasty appetizer and snack.
