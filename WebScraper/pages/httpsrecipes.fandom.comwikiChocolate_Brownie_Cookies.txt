 If a fudgy brownie and chewy chocolate chip cookie had a baby, it would be this decadent creation. Gluten-free! : 
 Ingredients : 
 SERVINGS: MAKES 2 DOZEN
 
         
 3 cups gluten-free powdered sugar 
 ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
 2 large egg whites 
 1 large egg 
 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped 
 3 tablespoons cacao nibs (or chocolate chips, gluten free) 
 Preparation : 
 Instructions : 
 Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350°. Whisk powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl, then whisk in egg whites and egg; fold in chocolate and cacao nibs. Spoon batter by the tablespoonful onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2” apart. 
 Bake, rotating sheets once, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and set just around the edges, 14–16 minutes. 
 Transfer baking sheets to wire racks and let cookies cool on pan (they’ll firm up). 
 DO AHEAD: : 
 Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
