Ingredients : 
 cottage cheese 
 vegemite   or   marmite 
 salt  to taste 
 pepper  to taste 
 basil  (optional) 
 tomato  (optional) 
 toasted  bread 
 Directions : 
 Just lightly scrape a slice of toast with Vegemite or Marmite and top with cottage cheese. 
 Add pepper to taste. The vegemite/marmite adds rich flavour and a bit of salt so the cottage cheese takes on a Cheddary flavour. 
 Also top with tomato and basil for extra vitamin C and Italiany flavour.
