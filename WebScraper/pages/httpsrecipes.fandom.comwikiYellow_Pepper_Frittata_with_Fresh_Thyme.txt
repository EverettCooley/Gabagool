 Reduce heat to medium and cook until pepper is soft. 
 Pour egg mixture over the vegetables. 
 Reduce heat to low and cook until eggs are firm around the edges.

 Slip the frittata cooked side up back into the pan.

 Cut into wedges and drizzle with the extra-virgin olive oil season with salt and pepper. 
 Serve immediately.
