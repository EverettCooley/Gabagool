Favorite Pot Roast (adapted For The Pressure Cooker)For The Pressure Cooker, You Need More Liquid. I've Doubled The BeefBouillon in The Recipe. When Converting Crockpot to Pressure Cooker, TheCooking Time is Cut Way Down. 8-10 Hours on Low in The Crockpot is About
 
 50-60 Minutes in The Pressure Cooker Under 15 Pounds of Pressure And aLittle Longer Under 10 Pounds of Pressure (perhaps an Hour And 15 Minutes).In a Bowl, Combine  salt , Seasoned  salt ,  pepper ,  paprika  And Minced  Onion .Rub All Sides of The Meat With This Mixture. in Pressure Cooker, CombineSeasoned  Beef  With  Onion  And Bouillon. Place Lid on Pressure Cooker, LockDown And Cook Under 15 Pounds Pressure For 50-60 Minutes. Bring DownPressure Either Naturally or Use The  water  Method. Meat Should be TenderWhen You Open The Cooker. (if Not, You Can Put The Lid Back on And PressureCook For Another 10-15 Minutes). Remove From Pot; Slice. 
 
Notes:
 If Gravy is Preferred You Can Thicken Juices With  flour  Dissolved in SmallAmount of Cold  water . Just Bring The Pressure Down, Open The Cooker, AndThen Add  flour  And Put on Low-Medium Heat Until Everything Thickens (you CanRemove The Meat First And Just Thicken The Juices if You Like). -If Desired,Vegetables Such as  potatoes ,  carrots , White  onions ,  celery ,  Mushrooms  orTurnips May be Added With The Bouillon And Cooked at The Same Time With TheMeat.
