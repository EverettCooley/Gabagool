 Reviews : 
 According to Tulsa World's Lunch Bunch the thickness of the chips made them "perfect for a dip". [1]  The chips are "perfectly sliced" and have a "pretty color". Yet, despite the "good salt and pepper seasoning" the taste of chips was considered to be "a bit bland". The Lunch Bunch gave the chips a B overall.
 These chips are the number one favorite of  taquitos.net's  Senior Review Editor, Melissa Shaw.
