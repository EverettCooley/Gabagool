Description : 
 The crockpot does wonders for lean cuts of  beef , which can be tough and chewy. A day in the crockpot makes it meltingly tender. The beauty of this all-in-one meal is that  beef  is just one part of this stew, so you really don't need to use more than ¾ of a pound to feed six people. Added protein and fiber comes from the black-eyed peas.
