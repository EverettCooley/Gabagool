This recipe makes a wonderfully tasty  Pork  sandwich, and is a favorite with the men in my family. You can adjust the "heat" to your liking. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 (0.75 lbs)  pork tenderloins , trimmed of visible fat 
 vegetable  cooking spray 
 1 cup  apple cider   or   apple juice 
 1 large  onion , sliced 
 1 tablespoon  barbecue sauce 
 1 teaspoon minced  garlic  (1 medium clove) 
 ⅛ teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 ⅛ teaspoon  crushed red pepper  flakes (use  cayenne pepper  for extra heat) 
 ⅛ teaspoon ground  cloves 
 ¼ teaspoon grated  fresh ginger 
 ¼ teaspoon ground  thyme 
 French  baguettes   or  sourdough French baguettes  or  rolls 
 Directions : 
 Coat a Dutch oven with  cooking spray ; place oven on medium-high heat until hot. 
 Add tenderloins and cook about 10 minutes or until browned. 
 Turn occasionally. 
 Combine the  apple cider  or juice with the remaining ingredients in a bowl. 
 Pour over the tenderloins. 
 Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the tenderloin. 
 Bring to a boil. 
 Reduce heat and simmer covered, for about 40 minutes or until thermometer reads 160°F. 
 Occasionally, baste with the pan juices. 
 When done, remove tenderloins to a cutting board and allow to stand for at least 10 minutes before slicing. 
 While the tenderloins are resting, heat the juices to boiling and cook until they are reduced to a thick syrupy sauce (about 10 minutes). 
 Slice the tenderloins diagonally across the grain into thin slices. 
 Serve on a baguette or roll sliced in half lengthwise. 
 Top the sliced  pork  with the "sauce".
