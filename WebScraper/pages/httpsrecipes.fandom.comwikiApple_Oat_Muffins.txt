 In a separate bowl, beat together the  prune purée ,  milk ,  maple syrup ,  egg  whites and  apples . 
 Stir the we ingredients into the dry ingredients until the dry ingredients are moistened. 
 Transfer  batter  to nonstick or paper lined muffin cups, or to muffin cups lightly sprayed with vegetable  cooking spray . 
 Bake 20 – 30 minutes until muffin tops are lightly browned and a wooden toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean. 
 Note : 
 You can substitute ⅓ cup commercially prepared puréed prune baby food for  prune butter  (found in jam and jelly of baking section of your supermarket for the  prune purée ) the baby food  prune  jars you will need 2 x ½ oz jars and the  prune butter  will add extra calories to the added sugars in the mixture. I used the baby food  prunes  and it worked quite well.
