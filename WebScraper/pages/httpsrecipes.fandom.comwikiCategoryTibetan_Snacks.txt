 An interesting Tibetan snack unusual for the European cuisine is made of yak’s blood. The yak’s blood is stored in the refrigerator to freeze in cube shapes. Next step is to add the hot butter and the white sugar. There is a Tibetan snack, similar to the beef jerk but this one is made of yak meat.The Tibetan “Pink Sausages” are another popular snack. The “Tsamba” is made from highland barley, dried, fried and grounded in rice powder. 
 The “Tsamba” is served in a bowl with milk, ghee, buttered tea and sugar. The “Tsamba” is put inside the bowl to mix with the ingredients. The “Momos” is another popular snack in Tibet which is made of purpose flour, water, ground beef, onion, spinach, garlic, fresh ginger, scallions, cilantro, salt and pepper. A mixture is obtained from flour and water, which will be shaped into small balls. The rest of the ingredients are mixed together for the filling. When the filling of the dough is done, the small balls need to be boiled in a pot with salted water. The “Momos” can be served with salsa made from tomatoes, cilantro, green onions and garlic. But it can be also served with a “Sriracha” sauce made of chilies and garlic.
