 About Armenian cucumber : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Armenian Cucumber on Wikipedia 
 The Armenian Cucumber is actually a type of long, slender melon (Cucumis melo var flexuosus), in which the fruits are harvested while still unripe, like the cucumber. It should not be confused with the  snake gourds  ( Trichosanthes spp. ). The skin is burpless, has no bitterness, is very thin and the fruit is almost always used without peeling.
