An Italian term that refers to a pasta dish of spaghetti with a sauce of eggs, Parmesan cheese, ground black pepper and bits of stir-fried "pancetta" (a kind of cured, smoked and seasoned bacon made with the belly part of the pig). Fresh green peas are sometimes used to add flavor and color.
 Outside of Italy, the distinctive creaminess it is widely believed to come from cream, but real carbonara has none.
Creaminess is instead achieved by whisking raw eggs with some of the hot, starchy water used to cook the spaghetti.
 It takes its name from the Carbonari; a secret revolutionary society founded in early 19th-century in Italy.
Tradition says that the families of those outlaws used to bury food for them in agreed spots, and eggs, bacon and pasta were the most common choice for the way they conserve over time at natural temperature
