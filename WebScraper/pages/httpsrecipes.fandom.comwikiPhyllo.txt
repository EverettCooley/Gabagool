 About Phyllo : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Phyllo on Wikipedia 
 Phyllo (also spelled 'filo') dough is used in thin layers to make pastries and originated in Mediterranean cuisine. Versions of phyllo can also be used as crusts for pies or casseroles. Shredded phyllo is called kataifi and is also used for pastries. The Greek word Phyllon literally means 'leaf'. The layers of phyllo dough can be as thin as paper or a few millimeters thick. In Turkish cuisine these pastries are called börek or böreği, in Albanian cuisine they are called byrek, in Austrian-German-Hungarian cuisine the dough is called blätterteig and pastries made from phyllo are called strudel. In Bosnia, phyllo by itself is called jufka, the word burek is only used for the pastries with meat and other kinds are called pita. In Serbian language phyllo is called kore (plural) za pitu, savory filings are gibanica, zeljanica and pita sa mesom, while pastries have various names, depending on mode of preparation. In Bulgaria it is called kori za banitsa (pl.) and the generic name for the pastries is banitsa, though there are sometimes special names for the specific kinds.
