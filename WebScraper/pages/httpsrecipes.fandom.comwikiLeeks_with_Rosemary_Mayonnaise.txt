 Ingredients : 
 8  leeks 
 250 ml (1 cup) salted  chicken stock  (or  vegetable stock ) 
 2  bay leaves 
 2 x 7,5 cm sprigs fresh  rosemary 
 paprika  to garnish 
 Rosemary mayonnaise : 
 1  egg 
 20 ml (4 tsp)  lemon juice 
 2 ml (1/2 tsp)  salt 
 200 ml (0.8 cup)  oil 
 5 ml (1 tsp)  sugar 
 10 ml (2 tsp)  Dijon mustard 
 50 ml (1/4 cup)  sour cream 
 Directions : 
 Cut off roots and most of the tops of the  leeks , leaving not more than 3 cm of the green leaves. 
 Remove outside layer. 
 Make a shallow cut down length of  leek  so that the layers may be opened out slightly. 
 Wash very well to remove grit. 
 Put stock,  bay leaves  and  rosemary  sprigs into large frying pan with a lid. 
 Add  leeks , bring to boil and simmer, covered, for about 7 â€“ 10 minutes or until just cooked. 
 Cool in liquid, then drain and chill, reserving  rosemary . 
 To make the  mayonnaise , place  egg ,  lemon juice ,  salt , 25 ml  oil ,  sugar  and  mustard  into a blender. 
 Strip needles from the reserved cooked  rosemary  sprigs and add. 
 Blend until well mixed, then with motor running, add remaining  oil  in a slow, steady stream. 
 Tip into small bowl, stir in  sour cream , cover and chill for at least 2 hours. 
 To serve, arrange chilled  leeks  on serving plates - 2 each should be enough, depending on size. 
 Spoon some  mayonnaise  down the centre of each serving, and dust with  paprika .
