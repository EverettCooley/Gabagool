Description : 
 Potjiekos - cooking food in a three-legged cast-iron pot suspended over the coals - has been a South African tradition since the days when travellers ventured into the unexplored interior of the country. Game was plentiful when the Voortrekkers and the transport riders travelled the country in their ox wagons, and venison was extensively used. Because of the current popularity of this cooking method, however, all kinds of food are now used to make potjiekos. Seafood makes a delectable potjie, but this combination of white fish and seafood is much more economical and just as tasty.
