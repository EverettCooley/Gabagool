 About Jalapeno pepper : 
 Wikipedia Article  About jalapeño pepper on Wikipedia 
 Named after Jalapa, the capital of Veracruz, Mexico, these smooth, dark green (scarlet red when ripe) chiles range from hot to very hot. They have a rounded tip and are about 2 inches long and ¼ to 1 inch in diameter. Besides their flavor, jalapenos are quite popular because they're so easily seeded (the seeds and veins are extremely hot). They're available fresh and canned and are used in a variety of sauces, sometimes stuffed with cheese, fish or meat, and in a multitude of dishes. 
 The jalapeño is a small to medium-sized chile pepper that is prized for the hot, burning sensation that it produces in the mouth when eaten. It is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum. The name jalapeño is pronounced IPA: /hɑləˈpeɪnjoʊ/ or IPA: /hæləˈpeɪnjoʊ/ in English, and IPA: /xalaˈpeɲo/ in the original Spanish. It is named after the city of Xalapa, Veracruz where it was traditionaly produced. Sixty square kilometres are dedicated for the cultivation of jalapeno in Mexico alone; primarily in the Paloapán river basin in the north of the state of Veracruz and in the Delicias, Chihuahua area. Jalapeno is also cultivated in smaller scale in Jalisco, Nayarit, Sonora, Sinaloa and Chiapas.
 Dried smoked jalapeños are called  chipotles
