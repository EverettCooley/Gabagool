 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ripe avocados 
 4  flour  tortillas, whole  Wheat  or regular 
 1 Cup chopped  tomatoes 
 ¼ Cup or less chopped  Onion  (to taste) 
 1 Cup grated  Cheddar   Cheese 
 DIP 
 ½ Cup  sour cream  or plain  yogurt 
 ¼ Cup or so bottled salsa (medium is best) 
 butter  for cooking 
 Directions : 
 Ingredients are placed on tortillas across the middle as in fajitas or Chinese mo she (make a diameter across the round with the ingredients). 
 Start by using up to half an  avocado  (depending on yield) per tortilla - simply scoop out the flesh and lay it across. 
 Next top with  tomatoes  and  Onion  and  Cheese  (saving a small bit of grated  Cheese  for "glue"). 
 Roll the tortillas up into a tube, stuffing a small amount of  Cheese  under the flap. 
 On a medium-hot no-stick pan, drop a little  butter  and wait until melted. 
 Roll the tortilla in the melted  butter , letting go "flap down" so the  Cheese  glue will melt it shut.
 Continue with all four tortillas, flipping each three times to grill all sides of the tube. 
 They should be crispy. 
 Serve hot and dip into salsa blend if desired.
 A fantastic brunch dish for two or appetizer (cut into thirds) for summer parties and the like. 
 Try red or spring  onions , various cheeses, add shredded  lettuce  - its a great recipe to build on. 
 Once you get the hang of it, preparation (including chopping and grating) and cooking takes just twenty minutes.
 Faster with team effort!
