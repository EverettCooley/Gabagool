 Description : 
 Ever wondered what to do with those  Mushrooms  in your fridge that have passed the “use by” date by a couple of days or so?  potatoes  in your cupboard sprouting a few shoots perhaps? A couple of handfulls of frozen  Peas  lurking in a bag in the depths of your freezer compartment? Wishing you could do something about those  onions  you haven’t used yet?Time for another Route79 cooking lesson:
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 1 bag of  Mushrooms  chopped into quarters 
 2 large  onions  chopped finely 
 1 tin of peeled plum- tomatoes 
 2 medium  potatoes , peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks 
 Frozen, pre-pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and green-chillie (Read this recipe for more info on this.) 
 Spices:  turmeric  (Haldi),  garam masala , Ground Coriander,  salt ,  jeera  ( cumin ) seeds 
 A large-ish pot in which to pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of  vegetable oil 
 Optional: some fresh (or frozen) chopped  coriander leaf  to garnish at the end 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  in the pot until hot. Add the  cumin  seeds and watch them pop and fizzle for around 20 seconds. Then add the finely chopped  onions  and fry until they are brownish.
 
       Heat oil and fry the jeera(cumin) seeds until popping     
         Fry onions until brownish     
 Then add the pre-pulped, frozen  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie chunks and stir-fry for a few minutes before adding the spices: 2 teaspoons  salt , 2 teaspoons haldi (tumeric), 3 teaspoons  garam masala , 2 teaspoons ground coriander. Stir it all up until the aroma starts to take over your kitchen.
 
 
         Add the garlic chillie and ginger and then fry     
         Add the spices and fry     
 After a few minutes - add the tinned peeled- plum tomato  - and chop them up coarsely with your wooden spoon in the pot:
 
         Add the peeled plum tomatoes     
         Chop the tomatoes with the wooden spoon     
 Fry on medium heat for a few minutes - stirring occasionally - until you can see the  oil  separating from the mixture when you stir it. Then add the chopped  Potato .
 
         Stir the mixture until the oil starts to     
         Add the chopped potatoes to the mixture     
 Stir it all up thoroughly - and then add around 500ml of boiling  water .
 
         Stir it all thoroughly     
         Add some boiling water     
 Then put the lid half-on and let it simmer semi-vigorously for around 10 mins before adding the chopped  Mushrooms .
 
         Simmer untll the poptatoes are mostly cooked     
         Add the chipped mushrooms     
 Simmer for around 10 more minutes - stirring occasionally - and then add the bowl-full of frozen  Peas  - and once again, stir thoroughly.
 
         Stir occasionally - let the water evaporate     
         Add the frozen peas     
 After the pot has reached the consistency that you prefer - switch off the flame and let it sit for around 10 minutes whilst you prepare the fresh  basmati rice  (or instead: pour into a deep bowl and prepare some warmed pitta bread or toast) with side-salad and/or chillie/ mango  pickle. Then serve up (and sprinkle with some fresh/frozen  coriander leaf /stalks) and enjoy whilst it’s hot!
 
 
         Simmer until te consistency is of your liking     
 Any leftovers can be kept in a cling-filmed bowl or plastic container for up to two days in the fridge. But be sure to not keep leftover  rice  like that though. Throw any leftover  rice  away - always make it fresh the next day. (According to my Mum - “old”  rice  is not good for your brain.)
