Description : 
 When yogurt is strained, the whey is removed, resulting in a thick, creamy yogurt cheese, perfect for slathering on toast or bagels. Use as a spread on crostini, topped with a sliver of smoked fish or prosciutto. Look for cheese cloth, a thin, loose woven cloth with many kitchen applications, in the housewares section of the store.

 Makes about 1 cup 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups whole milk  yogurt 
 1 tablespoon extra virgin  olive oil 
 1 teaspoon finely grated  lemon zest 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh  chives 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh  thyme

 Directions : 
 Line a strainer with a double layer of cheese cloth. 
 Spoon the yogurt into the strainer and let it drain, suspended over a bowl for at least 2 hours. 
 Discard the drained liquid. 
 The longer the yogurt is strained, the thicker the resulting cream. 
 If you desire a thicker spread, drain the yogurt overnight in the refrigerator. 
 In small bowl whisk the strained yogurt with the olive oil, lemon zest, salt, pepper, chives, thyme, tarragon and basil. 
 Let stand for 15 minutes for flavors to meld. 
 Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
