 Cookbook: How to Cook Everything 
 Typed by: Susan alexanderjamesmom@gmail.com 
 Time: about 20 minutes 
 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  peanut oil 
 1 cup minced  onion 
 2 tbsp minced  garlic 
 4 cups  chicken ,  beef , or  vegetable stock , or water, preferably warmed 
 1 tbsp  soy sauce 
 salt  to taste 
 about 3 cups roughly chopped  kale  leaves (stripped from the stalks and well rinsed) 
 minced  cilantro  leaves for garnish 
 1 fresh  jalapeno chile , stemmed and mined (optional) 
 1  lime , cut into eighths 
 Directions : 
 Place the oil in a large, deep saucepan and turn the heat to medium-high. 
 Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown, 5 to 8 minutes. 
 When the onion is tender and golden, add the garlic. 
 Cook 1 minute, and then add the stock or water. 
 Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, add the soy sauce, and taste for salt; add some if necessary. 
 Add the kale to the simmering broth and cook until it is nice and tender, about 10 minutes (you may prepare the soup in advance up to this point. Cover refrigerate for up to 2 days, and reheat before proceeding). 
 Correct the seasoning (you may prefer to add more soy sauce rather than more salt), garnish, and serve, passing the minced jalapeno and pieces of lime at the table.
