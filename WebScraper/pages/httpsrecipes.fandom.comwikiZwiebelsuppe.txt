Description : 
       Zwiebelsuppe     
 Clear German onion soup. This is very different from  French onion soup . The broth is very clear and smaller rounds of bread float on top of soup. Adapted from Schoener Essen magazine, translated from the German. Perfect choice for a dinner party. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 150 g  onions , peeled,thinly sliced into rings 
 150 g  red onions , peeled,thinly sliced into rings 
 2 cloves fresh  garlic , thinly sliced 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1 teaspoon fresh  marjoram , chopped 
 100 ml dry  white wine 
 1 liter  chicken broth 
 4 slices sandwich  bread 
 30 g shredded  Parmesan cheese 
 salt , to taste 
 pepper , to taste 
 fresh  marjoram , to garnish (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Heat  oil  in a large pot. 
 Saute  garlic  slices and chopped  marjoram  2 minutes. 
 Add the  onion  slices and cook about 5 minutes (or longer if you like them very soft). 
 Add wine and broth and cook, uncovered, 10 minutes at a gentle simmer (bubbling, but not boiling). 
 Meanwhile, heat up your broiler and line a baking sheet with foil. 
 Using a 6 cm round biscuit cutter, cut bread slices into rounds (discard excess)- you may also use a glass. 
 Set bread rounds on foil lined pan and sprinkle with  cheese  and broil only about 1 minute- just to melt  cheese . 
 Test soup- season well with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Soup is ready when  onions  are tender- broth will be very clear and pinkish in color. 
 Ladle into bowls and float a bread round on top of each bowlful, garnishing with some extra fresh  marjoram  if desired.
