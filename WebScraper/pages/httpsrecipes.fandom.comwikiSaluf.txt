Description : 
 Oven-baked flat bread. This is not an easy bread to make, as the flipping of the flattened loaf onto the sides of a hot oven is an art form that needs to be mastered.
 
 Serves 4 – 6 
 Ingredients : 
 3 tbsp  fenugreek seeds , crushed 
 1½ tsp  tomato puree 
 ½ kilo  flour 
 1 tbsp  active dry yeast 
 Directions : 
 Combine the  fenugreek seeds  with the  tomato  puree and 3 tbsp of  water  and mix together well. 
 Cook over a low flame and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. 
 Remove from the heat. 
 Sift together the  flour  and  yeast  and then knead the mixture together with just enough lukewarm  water  to make a moderately thick dough. 
 Cover lightly and let stand to rise for half an hour. 
 Repeat the kneading and rising process 6 times in all, kneading at half hour intervals. 
 Heat the oven to its highest possible temperature. 
 Turn off the heat and, taking care not to burn yourself, wipe the walls of the oven with a wet cloth. 
 Immediately after the last kneading flatten the dough and make two thin loaves. 
 Over each spread 3 tbsp of the  fenugreek  mixture and, with a rapid motion, stick the breads on the walls of the oven. 
 Let cook just until the bread peels off the walls and falls to the floor of the oven.
