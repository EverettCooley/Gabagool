      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Even in the Route79 household we occasionally cook from packet-mixes! Yep - when you just feel like throwing it all in a pot and letting it cook for itself - you can do so. I do this occasionally out of sheer curiosity - and last night was no exception.
 I have noticed over the last year or so - the Indian shops on my High Street have been carrying "packet-mix" sachets of some of the most classic of Indian/Asian cuisine. I have always been tempted to try some out - and so I picked a packet called "Parampara Chole Gravy Mix". The company name is "Parampara" in this case (it seems to have been imported from Pune in India) - and the recipe is "Chole Gravy Mix" - "Chole" is pronounced "Cholay" - and refers to a classic NorthWestern/Punjabi dish made from  Chickpeas  (sometimes known in restaurants as "channa  masala ". This is classic Indian "street-food" or "comfort food" and is best served with  rice , or better still, with a type of fried fluffy bread called "bhatura". Last night - we decided on having it with  rice .
 The whole idea of this packet-mix is that you just add the ready-boiled  Chickpeas  and  water  into a pot with the packet-mix and let it simmer on the stove until it's done! Fast food in an instant! (Well - in an hour anyway!) I am guessing that these packet-mixes will appeal to the younger, busier Indian generation who on occasions cannot be bothered to go to great lengths to stock or prepare all the necessary ingredients - as it's all in the packet" Including  oil ,  salt  and spices etc. (Yes - the packet is made of heavy, sealed foil and the contents feel slightly soft and squidgy.)
 So I decided to give it a go. This is what you need:
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 packet of Parampara Chole Gravy Mix 
 1 tin of boiled  chickpeas  (you can get this from any Indian shop or the "world foods" aisle of most major supermarkets 
 About 800 ml of  water 
       Tin of boiled chickpeas     
       packet-mix     
 Directions : 
 Start by opening the tin of  Chickpeas  and washing it using the "sieve under the cold tap" method. Open up the packet-mix also:
 
         Wash and drain the tin of boiled chickpeas     
           
 Then put the drained, boiled  Chickpeas  into a pot and add the packet-mix and  water  - and bring to boil. Reduce the heat so that it simmers - and keep it simmering with the lid off for around one hour. Yep - one hour. Stirring occasionally.
 
         Add the water and let it simmer for an hour with lid-off until reduced     
           
 Then, when the "gravy" has reduced so that the  Chickpeas  are visible in a semi-thick consistency - have a taste and see what you think. In my case I think it needed a bit more  salt  - and I also added a few pieces of chopped fresh  tomato  - as well as half a finely-chopped  Onion . (Toss in the  Onion  and the  tomato  raw - and let it simmer gently for a few more minutes.)
 Put the lid back on and let it sit for around 15 mins whilst you prepare some fresh  basmati rice  - or heat up some pitta-bread or make some toast.
 Serve with a chunky salad of  cucumber ,  tomato  and  carrot  - and/or some  mint  chutney on the side.
 I was mildly surprised at how good it tasted. Ok - so it was slightly bland - and could have done with a bit of extra  garam masala  or ground red-chillie - but it wasn't bad for such a low-effort dish. Not bad at all ...
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 Route 79 
From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
