 Ingredients : 
 4  hard boiled eggs 
 ½ sprig of  parsley 
 ½ sprig of  dill 
 ½ sprig of  chive 
 2 oz of  butter 
 salt 
 1 tbsp of  sweet pepper 
 2 tbsp of  breadcrumbs 
 1 oz of grated  emmental  cheese 
 Directions : 
 This dish requires considerable skill, since the hard-boiled eggs have to be cut lengthwise with their shell. 
 To keep the shell from cracking, cut them with a large and very sharp knife. 
 Cut the hard-boiled eggs in half in a single motion and extract the egg whites and yolk carefully with a spoon. 
 Mince the egg whites. 
 Mash the yolk with a fork and mix both ingredients. 
 Wash the parsley, dill and chive and dry them off softly. 
 Mince the parsley and chop the dill and chives with a knife. 
 Mix the mince with 2 oz of butter and the egg dough, season everything with salt and pepper and stuff the egg shells with it. 
 Sprinkle the stuffing with breadcrumbs and grated cheese and arrange the rest of the butter in small pieces on top. 
 Place the stuffed shells on a baking tray or frying pan and place it in the oven on the center rack.
