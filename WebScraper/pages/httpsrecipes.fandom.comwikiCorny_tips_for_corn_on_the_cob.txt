 Tips : 
 Really sweet varieties of corn on the cob make a very tasty treat the next day. Ears can be individually wrapped in plastic and placed in the refrigerator. Eaten chilled, as is, will surprise you and your children. 
 To add a touch of sweetness to corn on the cob, just boil it in water with a little bit of sugar.
