Originated in a tiny French village called 'Chavignol', this cheese is made from goat's milk, its flavour is subtle and slightly nutty in taste. When fresh it is solid and compact, with white rind. As it ripens, the becomes crumbly and as it matures the mould causes bluish colour. 
 It goes well with green salads, wines especially, the Sancerre wine produced in this region.
