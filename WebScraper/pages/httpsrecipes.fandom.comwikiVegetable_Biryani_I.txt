 Ingredients : 
 3 large  onions , sliced 
 4 tbsp  butter   or   clarified butter 
 6  chili peppers , crushed into a paste  or  2 tsp  cayenne pepper 
 1 x 2-inch piece of  fresh ginger 
 10 cloves  garlic 
 ½ cup dry  lentils , pre-soaked 
 ½ lb fresh  green peas , shelled 
 ½ lb  carrots , chopped 
 ½ lb  green beans , chopped 
 3 large  tomatoes , chopped 
 6 whole  cloves 
 1 x 4-inch stick of  cinnamon 
 6  cardamom  pods, crushed 
 1 tsp  turmeric 
 3 sprigs of fresh  mint   or  ½ tsp dried  mint  leaves, pounded 
 2 cups long-grain  white rice  ( Basmati  is a good choice), uncooked 
 6 large  potatoes , chopped into large chunks 
 1 - 2 tsp  salt 
 yogurt 
 Directions : 
 In a large, heavy skillet or stew pot, fry the  onions  in  butter  until they are golden brown. With a slotted spoon, remove about 1/3 of the slices and set aside. Add to the pot the  ginger ,  garlic  and  chile paste , and fry for 5 or 6 minutes, stirring constantly. Then add the  Lentils ,  green peas ,  carrots  and  green beans . Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes, adding more  butter , or a bit of  oil , if necessary. 
 Add  tomatoes , spices and  mint , and stir for 5 minutes. Then pour in about a cup of hot  water , cover, and simmer until vegetables are about half cooked. Add  rice ,  potatoes ,  salt , and another 4 - 5 cups of hot  water  (use the lesser amount if your vegetables have created quite a bit of liquid). Cover again, and cook for another 20 – 30 minutes until  rice  is done and  water  is absorbed. 
 To serve, garnish with the reserved  Onion  slices, and pass around a bowl of  yogurt  as a sauce.
