Description : 
 These keep fairly well in a covered container, and freeze well according to the cookbook. Try  ginger  (used in some Australian anzac cookies) instead of  cinnamon . 
 
 Makes about 36 cookies. 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  butter  ( margarine ) 
 ⅓ cup lightly packed  brown sugar 
 ¼ cup warm  water 
 1 cup  flour , divided ¼ cup aside 
 1 cup  quick rolled oats 
 1 tsp  cinnamon 
 ½ tsp  baking soda 
 Directions : 
 Cream  butter  and  sugar  together thoroughly, then beat in  water . 
 Set aside ¼ cup  flour  for rolling. 
 Mix together the remaining dry ingredients, then stir them into the creamed mixture. 
 Add the remaining  flour  gradually to the dough until it is stiff enough to roll. 
 Divide the dough into 3 lumps about the same size. 
 Roll each lump of dough out about ⅛ inch thick and cut into 12 pieces about the same size. 
 This is much easier than trying to use a cookie cutter if you need to know cookies per serving. 
 Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet. 
 Bake at 350°F about 10 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. 
 Remove from pan, cool. 
 Store in a covered container.
