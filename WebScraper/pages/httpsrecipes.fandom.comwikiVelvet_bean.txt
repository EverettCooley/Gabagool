 Wikipedia Article  About Velvet Bean on Wikipedia 
 The tropical legume Mucuna pruriens (syn. Dolichos pruriens) is known by a multitude of common names, including velvet bean, cowitch, cowhage, kapikachu, nescafe, sea bean, kratzbohnen, konch, and atmagupta. The plant is an annual, climbing shrub with long vines that can reach over 15 m. It bears white, lavender, or purple flowers and pods that are covered in loose orange hairs which cause a severe itch if they come in contact with skin. The beans are shiny black or brown. It is found in tropical Africa, India, and the Caribbean.
