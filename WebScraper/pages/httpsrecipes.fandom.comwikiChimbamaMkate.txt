Ingredients : 
 15 very ripe  bananas , peeled 
 1 to 2 cups ufa ( cornmeal  or  cassava flour , preferably ngaiwa) 
 banana leaves 
 Directions : 
 Take  banana  leaves and pass them over a fire. 
 This makes them pliable. 
 Run a knife down the spine of the leaf, trimming off the thick part. 
 Cut them into thirds and rinse in  water . 
 Pound  bananas  with a mortar and pestle. 
 Pound in enough ufa to make a dough. 
 Place about a hamburger patty-sized amount of dough on each third of the  banana  leaf. 
 Completely wrap dough up with the leaf. 
 Place bundles in a pot vertically (do not pile too high) with enough  water  to cover the bottom. 
 Cover and place on a fire. 
 Place more coals on the lid. 
 Check after 20 to 30 minutes. 
 The dough should be bread-like inside.
