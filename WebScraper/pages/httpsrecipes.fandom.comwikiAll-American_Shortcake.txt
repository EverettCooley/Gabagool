 2¼ cups  whole wheat flour 
 2 teaspoons  baking powder

 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 6 tablespoons cold  unsalted butter , cut into cubes 
 1 cup  skim milk

 1 teaspoon  vanilla 
 1 pint  strawberries , sliced

 Roll out the dough (if desired, roll it out a second time) and cut into circles. 
 Place on a baking sheet, brush the tops with remaining  milk , and sprinkle with  sugar . 
 Bake for 10–15 minutes, until golden brown.

 Spoon some of the berry mixture on the bottom half and top with a dollop of fat-free  whipped cream .
