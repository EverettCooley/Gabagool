Ingredients : 
 vegan bread 
 sesame  tahini 
 sprouts 
 hot  sesame oil 
 stone ground vegan  mustard 
 black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Get a couple slices of vegan bread, I prefer a whole grain bread myself. 
 Spread sesame  butter  on one of the slices, throw on a big handful of sprouts (both sunflower and  alfalfa sprouts  work really well), and then sprinkle with hot  sesame oil . 
 On the other slice, spread a generous amount of  mustard  and top it with some freshly ground  black pepper . 
 Put the slices together for a great tasting sandwich.
