 2 tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard 
 ⅛ teaspoon  cayenne 
 1 cup dried  breadcrumbs 
 ½ cup freshly grated  Parmesan 
 1 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 20  chicken wings , wing tips cut off and discarded and the wings halved at the joint 
 Directions : 
 In a shallow dish whisk together the  butter , the  mustard , and the  cayenne . 
 In another shallow dish combine well the  breadcrumbs , the Parmesan, the  cumin , and  salt  and  black pepper  to taste. 
 Dip the  chicken  wings, a few at a time, in the  butter  mixture, letting the excess drip off, coat them with the crumb mixture, and arrange them without touching in a greased shallow baking pan. 
 Bake the  chicken  wings in the lower third of a preheated 425°F oven for 30 minutes. (if extra-crisp  chicken  wings are desired, turn the wings after 20 minutes.)
