Description : 
 Various Egusi (also called  agusi , agushi, egushi) soups are favorites in Western Africa. The soup is thickened with  flour  ground from seeds of a species of Cucurbitaceae (which includes gourds, melons,  pumpkins , and squashes, many of which are native to Africa). In Western Africa, these plants and seeds, as well as soups and stews made with them, are all called Egusi, and this is the name most commonly used outside of Africa.
