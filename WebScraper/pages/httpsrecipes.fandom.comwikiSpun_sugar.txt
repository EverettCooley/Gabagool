      Pears with spun sugar     Fine strands of hardened boiled sugar that are used to decorate various desserts. Spun sugar begins by cooking sugar, water and cream of tartar to the crack stage. A fork or whisk is then used to dip into the sugar syrup and draw out fine threads. These hair-like strands can be placed directly on a dessert or on a waxed paper-lined surface, then transferred later to the dish. Once the spun sugar hardens, it may also be gathered and sprinkled or arranged on top of a dessert. Cotton candy is a popular form of spun sugar.
