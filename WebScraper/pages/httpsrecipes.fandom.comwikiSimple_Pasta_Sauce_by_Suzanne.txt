It is really simple and leaves a lot of flavor for the  Pasta . I also like to add fresh ground  pepper  and  basil , you should experiment with the spices you like. I don"t think they take away too much from the flavor of the  Pasta . I hope you try it!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 clove  garlic , crushed 
 ½ cup  white wine 
 ¼ cup fresh  lemon juice 
 1 chopped  tomato 
 fresh ground  pepper 
 basil 
 Directions : 
 In a sauce pan that has heated for a minute, add 1 tsp  olive oil  and 1 clove  garlic , crushed. Cook until the  garlic  just turns brown. 
 [optional] add (or start out with): ½ cup  white wine  and cook until it is reduced by half. (most of the alcohol is gone by this point, but there is still good flavor). 
 Add ¼ cup fresh  lemon juice  and one chopped  tomato  and cook for two minutes more.
