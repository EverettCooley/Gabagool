Description : 
 This recipe doesn't get as pudding-like as instant, but even if it totally fails, it makes a great thick hot  chocolate . Also, according to my calculations, it has not much more than 100 calories for an entire cup. It has never failed to cure my  chocolate  cravings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  non-fat milk 
 1 tbsp  cornstarch 
 1 tbsp  cocoa 
 3 tbsp  sugar   [1] 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Whisk first four ingredients together in a saucepan (you want to make sure that the  cornstarch  is dissolved!). 
 Turn heat to medium. 
 Cook until mixture is hot, stirring the entire time (don't let it boil). 
 Turn heat to low and cook until pudding thickens. 
 Remove from heat. 
 Stir in  vanilla . 
 Eat. 
 Notes : 
 
 â†‘   I start with 2 tablespoons  sugar  and add more to taste. I forget how much was in the recipe to start with, but it was too much.
