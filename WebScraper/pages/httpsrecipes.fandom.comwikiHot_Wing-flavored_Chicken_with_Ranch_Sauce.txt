 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  hot pepper sauce   [1] , or to taste 
 1 tbsp fresh  lemon juice 
 2 tsp  olive oil 
 4 boneless, skinless  chicken breast  (about 4 oz each), all visible fat discarded 
 vegetable oil spray 
 1 cup  cornflake crumbs  (about 2 cups flakes) 
 ¼ cup fat-free or light  sour cream 
 ¼ cup low-fat  buttermilk 
 ½ tsp  garlic powder 
 ¼ tsp dried  dill  weed, crumbled 
 Directions : 
 In a large shallow bowl, stir together the hot-pepper sauce, lemon juice, and olive oil. 
 Add the chicken and turn to coat. 
 Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 8 hours, turning occasionally if longer than 30 minutes. 
 Discard the marinade. 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees f. 
 Lightly spray an 8-inch square baking pan with vegetable oil spray. 
 Put the cornflake crumbs on a plate. 
 Turn the chicken to coat both sides. 
 Transfer to the baking pan. 
 Lightly spray the top of the chicken with vegetable oil spray. 
 Bake for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the coating is crisp. 
 Transfer to a serving plate. 
 Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients. 
 Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 
 Spoon the sauce over the chicken or use as a dipping sauce. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Tip: Hot pepper sauce made from cayenne peppers (a bit milder) or  Tabasco  peppers works well. Let your heat tolerance be your guide.
