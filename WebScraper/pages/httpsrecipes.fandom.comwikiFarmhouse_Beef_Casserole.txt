 Peel and grate the potato into a bowl.

 Spread evenly over the bottom of the prepared casserole. 
 Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until potato is browned and crispy.

 Discard any excess fat. 
 Stir in tomatoes with their juice, chili powder, and the cabbage. 
 Season with pepper to taste. 
 Sauté, stirring, for a minute or two. 
 If mixture seems too dry, add 1 tablespoon of the bottled taco sauce, adding up to 2 tablespoons more, if needed, if mixture seems too dry.
