 Wikipedia Article  About Palm oil on Wikipedia 
 The reddish-orange oil extracted from the pulp of the fruit of the African palm. It's extremely high in saturated fat (78 percent) and has a distinctive flavor that is popular in West African and Brazilian cooking. Palm-kernel oil, though also high in saturated fat, is a different oil extracted from the nut or kernel of palms. It's a yellowish-white color and has a pleasantly mild flavor. Palm-kernel oil is used in the manufacture of margarine and cosmetics. It's usually listed on labels simply as palm oil. 
 Palm oil used in Africa and Bahia, the northeastern part of Brazil. Yellow colored and strong flavored.
