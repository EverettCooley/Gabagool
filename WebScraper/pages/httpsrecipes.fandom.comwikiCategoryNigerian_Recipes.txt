Recipes in the Nigerian cuisine are much based on special ingredients such as cassava, okra, palm oils, and starchy foods. Black-eyed peas are used in many recipes, fried or stewed, or even used for pancakes in the Akara recipe, made of black-eyed peas, palm oil, fresh garlic, coriander, thyme and onions. If used for the moi-moi recipe, the black-eyed peas will be mixed with corned beef, onion, fresh tomatoes, vegetable oil and condiments.
 Combined meats and interesting ingredient combination will be found in some Nigerian recipes, such as Nigerian dried fish flakes in the beef spinach stew, consisting also of chopped peanuts and chopped olives. The Nigerian groundnut stew contains pieces of fried chicken together with beef stew meat in the same dish with other ingredients like chopped onions, tomatoes, red peppers and peanut butter, and served with mashed sweet potatoes or hot cooked rice. Also, to prepare a Nigerian dish implies you to know how to prepare a Nigerian dessert, such as chin-chin (Nigerian cookies), where you have to mix the eggs with sugar, nutmeg, butter, milk and flour.
