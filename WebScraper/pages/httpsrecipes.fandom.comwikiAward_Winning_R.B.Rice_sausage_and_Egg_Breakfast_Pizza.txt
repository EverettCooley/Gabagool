 Ingredients : 
 1 lb. R.B.Rice mild sausage 
 1 Can crescent rolls (uncooked) 
 1 Cup grated mild cheddar cheese

 ½ Tsp. salt 
 ¼ Tsp. pepper 
 ¼ Cup small cubed ham 
 ¼ Cup chopped red pepper 
 Procedure : 
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Separate the crescent roll dough and lay onto an ungreased pizza pan, patting the dough out to make a crust (set aside). Crumble and brown the sausage in a skillet and drain. Sprinkle sausage onto the crust evenly. In a small bowl combine all the remaining ingredients and beat with a fork, making sure the eggs are well beaten. Pour the egg mixture over the sausage. Bake for 30 minutes or until eggs are cooked.
