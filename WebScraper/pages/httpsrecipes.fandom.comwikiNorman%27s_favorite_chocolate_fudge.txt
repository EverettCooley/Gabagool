 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 1/3 cup granulated sugar 
 1 4.6 oz pkg jello brand 
 vanilla cook & serve pudding 
 mix 
 3 tbsp all natural butter flavored 
 sprinkles 
 2 tbsp dutch processed european 
 style cocoa 
 4 tbsp instant non-fat dry milk 
 powder 
 1 cup (+2t) water 
 1 tbsp pecan pieces (would be 
 optional) 
 Directions : 
 If using an electric stove, preheat the largest burner to highest setting line a 6" x 8" x 2" pan or dish with aluminum foil. No need to veggie spray the foil since the fudge will not stick. Combine all ingredients (except the pecan pieces) in a 10" dutch oven (he uses cast iron). Place on preheated burner and bring to a full rolling boil while stirring continuously - cook 4.5 minutes, stirring continuously with a stainless steel whisk. Remove from heat and continue stirring until mixture stops boiling. Set a sheet pan (approx. 10" x 15") on top of a cold wet towel (cold tap water is fine). Pour mixture onto the sheet pan. Using a spatula, move mixture around so as to combine and blend those fudge crystals beginning to form on the bottom of the pan. After 2-3 minutes move sheet pan to a fresh cold towel and continue blending after a few minutes move sheet to another cold towel and as mixture starts to thicken begin moving and accumulating the mixture to the corner of the pan. As mixture becomes very thick, pour out into the foil lined pan. Spread fudge evenly and sprinkle the pecan pieces on top
