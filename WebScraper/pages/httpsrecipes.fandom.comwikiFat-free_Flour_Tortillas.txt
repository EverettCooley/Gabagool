 Tucsonan R.D. Skinner has recently put out a new cookbook,  "R.D. Skinner"s Best in Fat-free Cooking."  the book is not yet available in major book stores, but can be ordered by calling (602) 797-783. Here's a sample from the book. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups  all-purpose flour 
 2 tbsp  baking powder 
 1½ tbsp  salt 
 4 tbsp fat-free  mayonnaise 
 1¼ cup hot  water 
 Directions : 
 In large bowl, combine  flour ,  baking powder , and  salt . 
 Stir well. 
 Add fat-free  Mayonnaise  and use pastry blender (or fork) and blend until  flour  mixture appears to be coarse throughout. 
 Add hot  water  and stir well. 
 Knead in extra  flour . 
 Cover and allow to stand for 10 minutes. 
 Set iron griddle over medium to medium-high heat. 
 Tear off a piece of dough, roll into a ball (approximately 2½"). 
 On well-floured board, roll dough out into a circular flat form as thin as possible (less than ⅛" thickness) approximately 6" in diameter. 
 Add more  flour  if dough is sticky. 
 Place tortilla on heated griddle and allow it to bubble slightly. 
 Heat for approximately 1 – 2 minutes. 
 Flip tortilla and brown other side approximately 1 minute longer. 
 If tortilla has browned in variable spots and does not have a dough-like texture, then it is done.
