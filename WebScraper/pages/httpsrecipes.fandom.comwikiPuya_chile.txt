 About Puya chile : 
 Chiles are green immature vegetables, which become red at maturity. Basically, all the green peppers are unripe red ones and that is why their taste is not as hot as the one of the red chiles. The puya chile is a type of chile which resembles the  guajillo chile , but it is found in a smaller size and it has a more intense and hotter taste, with a fruity flavor. 
 The puya chile is sometimes used only for its flavor and not for its flesh. In this case, the puya chile is soaked for some minutes in water or roasted at high heat and then pureed or diced. Still, there are numerous recipes that include this aliment, due to both its hot taste and fruity flavor. The puya chile is used for pizza toppings, pasta fillings, with various meat dishes, especially pork and veal, but also with fish and chicken in the Asian cuisine. The puya chile is also mashed and used as a spice with a high heat level.
