Description : 
 Fried pork chops retain their tenderness and moisture when they aren't cooked to death. Cook ½-inch chops 5 minutes each side; ¾-inch chops only 8 minutes; 1-inch chops 10 minutes a side. Anything thicker should be lightly browned and then braised in liquid. All are especially nice served with a snowdrift of mashed potatoes.
