 Serves four. 
 Ingredients : 
 800 g  firm tofu 
 vegetable oil , for frying 
 cornflour , for dusting the tofu 
 150 g  butter 
 12  shallots  (350g), thinly sliced 
 8 mild  red chillies , thinly sliced 
 12  garlic  cloves, crushed 
 3 tbsp chopped fresh  ginger 
 3 tbsp  sweet soy sauce  ( kecap manis ) 
 3 tbsp  light soy sauce  ( shoyu ) 
 4 tsp  dark soy sauce  ( tamari ) 
 2 tbsp  caster sugar 
 5 tbsp  black peppercorns , coarsely crushed (use a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder) 
 16 small, thin  spring onions , cut into 3cm segments 
 Directions : 
 Start with the tofu. 
 Pour enough oil into a large frying pan or wok to come 5mm up the sides; heat up. 
 Meanwhile, cut the tofu into large cubes, about 3cm x 2cm, toss them in cornflour and shake off any excess. 
 Add the tofu to the hot oil in batches (so it doesn't stew) and fry, turning it around as you go, until golden all over and with a thin crust. 
 As each batch is cooked, transfer the tofu pieces to kitchen paper. 
 Remove the oil and any sediment from the pan, then add the butter. 
 Once it has melted, add the shallots, chillies, garlic and ginger, and saut√© on a low to medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients have turned shiny and are totally soft. 
 Next, add the soy sauces and sugar, stir, then add the crushed black pepper. 
 Add the tofu to warm it up in the sauce for about a minute, stir in the spring onions and serve hot, with steamed rice.
