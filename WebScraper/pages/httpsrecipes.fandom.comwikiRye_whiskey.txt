 About Rye whiskey : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Rye whiskey on Wikipedia 
 Rye whisky describes two types of whiskies, theoretically distilled from rye.
Canadian whisky is often called "rye whisky" in Canada and the United States, as historically much of the content was from rye. Today, however, most Canadian whisky is blended with only a small portion, if any, coming from rye. Popular brands are Canadian Club and Crown Royal.
 In the United States, "rye whiskey" (with an "e") is, by law, made from a mash of at least 51 percent rye. (The other ingredients of the mash are usually corn and malted barley.) Rye whiskey was the prevalent whiskey of the northeastern states, especially Pennsylvania, but had largely disappeared after Prohibition, with only a few remaining producers.
 In 1996, Fritz Maytag of the Anchor Brewery in San Francisco, California, began distilling Old Potrero Single Malt Whiskey under the label Anchor Distilling. The whiskey is made from 100 percent malted rye, and is one of the few single malt whiskey produced in the United States. Another single malt comes from Clear Creek Distillery in Oregon.
 Other prominent rye whiskey distillers in the United States include Jim Beam and Austin, Nichols, which markets its product under the Wild Turkey brand at 80° and 101° proof. Other labels include Old Overholt, Van Winkle Family Reserve, Rittenhouse, and Pikesville Supreme.
