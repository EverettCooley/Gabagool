This dip can be prepared up to 3 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Remove from refrigerator 45 minutes before serving. Serve the dip at room temperature.
 This dip is so simple, so delicious, and so much better than any  blue cheese  dip that uses bottled dressing. Buy a tangy and rich  blue cheese . Two good ones are Point Reyes Blue, from California, and  Maytag Blue , from Iowa. Though good with crudités and all sorts of chips, for a to die for combo, try this dip with homemade vegetable chips.
