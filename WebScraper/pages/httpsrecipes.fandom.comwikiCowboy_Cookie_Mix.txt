 1⅓ cups  quick cooking oats 
 1⅓ cups  all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  baking soda 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ cup chopped  pecans  or  walnuts 
 1 cup (6 ounce) semisweet  chocolate chips 
 ½ cup packed  brown sugar 
 ½ cup  sugar

 ½ cup  butter  or  margarine , melted 
 1  egg , lightly beaten 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla  extract

 Pour  oats  into a wide-mouth 1-quart jar or glass container with a tight fitting lid. 
 Combine the  flour , baking powder, baking soda  and  salt ; place on top of  oats . 
 Layer with the pecans,  chocolate chips ,  brown sugar  and  sugar , packing each layer tightly (to pack i use a skinny plastic glass with cellophane on it) but do not mix. 
 Cover and store in a cool dry place for up to 6 months. (if there is space left at the top — there should not be much — you can use cellophane to crunch up and put on top. I used the colored cellophane for the holidays) 
 To prepare cookies : 
 Pour cookie mix into a large mixing bowl;stir to combine ingredients. 
 Beat in the  butter ,  egg , and  vanilla . 
 Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
 Roll into 1-inch balls. 
 Place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. 
 Bake at 350°F for 11 to 13 minutes or until set. 
 Remove to wire racks to cool. 
 Note : 
 Decorate jars with raffia, I punch hole in directions and put raffia through it and tie to jar or container. Decorative jars and bottles that many products are sold in can be reused for this and also come in handy in the kitchen after it's empty.
