      Bundt Cake     
 A  bundt cake  is a dessert cake that is baked in a  bundt pan , shaping it into a distinctive ridged ring. The  d  in "bundt" is silent.
 The German word  bund  in  bundkuchen  originated either from bundling or wrapping the cake's dough around the pan's center hole or because a  bund  is a gathering of people. (In both German words, the final  d  is pronounced like a  t .)
 Dalquist trademarked the word bundt, and Pillsbury licensed the name in 1970 for a line of cake mixes.
