 Ingredients : 
 1 head  broccoli  or  broccoflower 
 1 tablespoon  water 
 1 tablespoon  apple cider vinegar  or  rice vinegar  or fresh  lemon juice 
 sugar 
 salt 
 Snow : 
 ⅔ cup  mayonnaise 
 ½ cup  sour cream 
 Directions : 
 Cut  broccoli  into florets, preferably large-ish ones with plenty of stem. 
 Cut the sides off the bottom part of the stem, discard the very bottom and sides, and slice, if so desired (they're not trees, but they can be "stumps"). 
 Place in a microwave-safe bowl. 
 Pour in  water  and  vinegar  or  lemon juice . 
 Sprinkle with  sugar  and  salt  to taste (don't overdo it; you can always adjust later). 
 Cover with plastic wrap. 
 Microwave about 1 minute 15 seconds, or until  broccoli  is very bright green and just a little soft, but still with all its yummy crunch. 
 Remove covering and let cool a bit; trees are good either at room temperature or a little above, but you don't want them to "melt" the snow!. 
 Mix  mayonnaise  and  sour cream  well to make snow. 
 Serve trees with snow for dipping, or lay out trees on plate and use a spoon to dab snow on their tops.
