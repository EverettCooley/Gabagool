 About Chaat masala : 
 Chaat masala (Hindi चाट मसाला; also spelled chat masala) is a masala, or spice mix, used in Indian cuisine. It typically consists of:
 
 amchoor  (dried mango powder) 
 cumin 
 kala namak 
 coriander 
 dried  ginger 
 salt 
 black pepper 
 asafoetida 
 chili powder 
 The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl, at chaat carts (especially in Gujarat, Maharastra, and across Northern and even Southern India).
 Chaat masala has a pungent almost eggy smell and tastes both sweet and sour. It is used to flavour all the popular fast foods of India like bhelpuri, golgappa, aaloo chaat and Dahi puri. It is something of an acquired taste, and can be added to all sorts of everyday foods and drinks or even eaten on its own.
