 Wikipedia Article  About Kashkaval (aged) on Wikipedia 
 Kashkaval (кашкавал) is a specific type of yellow sheep's milk cheese; however, in Bulgaria and Macedonia, the term is often used to refer to all yellow cheeses (or even any cheese besides Sirene.) In English-language menus in Bulgaria, "кашкавал" is always translated as "yellow cheese."
 Similarly, in Romania, Caşcaval is used to refer to a number of types of yellow cheese.
 The word Kashkaval is derived from Caciocavallo, an Italian cottage cheese.
