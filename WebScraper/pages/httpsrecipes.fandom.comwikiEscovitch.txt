      Escovitch     
 Ingredients : 
 4 medium  onions , peeled, sliced paper-thin 
 2 large  carrots , scraped, sliced paper-thin 
 2 medium  green peppers , cut into strips ¼" 
 2 medium  bay leaf , crumbled 
 ½ tsp  red pepper , crushed 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 black pepper , freshly ground 
 ½ cup  white wine vinegar 
 6 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 cups cold  water 
 2 lb  red snapper , skinned, filleted 
 Directions : 
 Combine  onions ,  carrots ,  green peppers ,  bay leaves , red pepper,  salt , and a few grindings of  black pepper  in a 3- to 4-quart enameled or stainless- steel saucepan. Pour in the  vinegar , 2 tablespoons of the  oil  and the  water , and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not falling apart. 
 Meanwhile, pour the remaining 4 tablespoons of  oil  into a heavy 10- to 12- inch skillet and heat over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. 
 Add a few fillets at a time, and cook them for 2 or 3 minutes on each side, or until delicately brown. As they brown, transfer the fillets to a large, shallow heatproof serving dish. 
 Pour the hot  vinegar  mixture over the fish, arranging the vegetables evenly and attractively on top. Serve immediately or cool to room temperature, cover tightly, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
