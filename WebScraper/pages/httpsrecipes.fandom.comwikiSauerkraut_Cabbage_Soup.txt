I made a pulled pork in the new CEPC on Wednesday night and today 
found the perfect use for some of the great broth from that dish. 
Hubby and I both love saurkraut so I made a simple cabbage saurkraut 
soup, it came out great and was something I will definitely make 
again.
 
   Saurkraut/Cabbage Soup
1 medium head of green cabbage shredded fine
2 15ounce cans saurkraut or 1 large bag
1/2 pound pork cubes, I used some leftover pulled pork
4 medium red potatoes, diced
1 medium onion diced
1/2 teaspoon pepper
6 cups stock, I used the broth from the pulled pork
 
 Set the pressure cooker to brown and add the meat and onions, sautee 
until the meat browns, if you are using leftover meat then just 
sautee the onions and add the meat after they are sauteed. Next layer 
the fresh cabbage, the potatoes,pepper and top with the saurkraut (we 
like it tangy so I didn't rinse it, but if you like it milder then 
rinse the saurkraut)
pour the 6 cups of stock over all and cover the cooker, you can 
substitute canned chicken or beef broth for the stock. Bring the 
cooker up to pressure and cook for 15 minutes, drop pressure 
whichever way you prefer. Taste and adjust seasoning and enjoy. I can 
see enjoying this on a chilly damp winter night.............brings 
back great memories.
