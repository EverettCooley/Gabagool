Description : 
 I put it on a whole wheat roll with fat-free  mayo ,  ketchup ,  lettuce ,  tomato , and  onion . It was quite filling. Oh, and I made a much bigger patty than this serving size, it was a little bigger than a typical hamburger  bun . With this size patty, I would say this recipe makes about 3 patties.
