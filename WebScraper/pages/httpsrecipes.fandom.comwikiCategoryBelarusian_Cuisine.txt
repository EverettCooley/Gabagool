Very few Western European influences were seen in the traditional Belarusian cuisine, but dishes containing potatoes (prepared in similar ways to the German cuisine) or those containing pasta and noodles are present today. The Belarusian cuisine is often considered to be quite “faded” when compared to the cuisines of its neighbors, this is why modern chefs are trying to eliminate this perception and offer delicious Belarusian dishes that can be enjoyed on an international scale. There are many chefs who creatively use the basic ingredients and cooking method for traditional Belarusian dishes and create original and delicious food variations. Belarusian chefs are passionate about their traditional dishes and they enjoy presenting them to foreigners who have never tasted them before. Whether they are cooking Zatirka or red beet soup, served with stuffed dumplings or more sophisticated Belarusian dishes, such as the delicious duck filled with apples, Belarusian chefs take pride in what they do, and this is readily noticeable in the unforgettable taste of their cooking.
