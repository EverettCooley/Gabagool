 About Holy basil : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Holy Basil on Wikipedia 
 The tulsi (also known as tulasi) plant or Holy Basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) is an important symbol in the Hindu religious tradition. The name "tulsi" means "the incomparable one". Tulsi is a venerated plant and Hindus worship it in the morning and evening. Tulsi grows wild in the tropics and warm regions. Dark or Shyama (Krishna) tulsi and light or Rama tulsi are the two main varieties of basil. The former possesses greater medicinal value and is commonly used for worship.
 Its aroma is distinctively different to its close cousin, the Thai Basil which is sometimes wrongly called Holy basil, in shops and on the internet, but they can be distinguished by appearance, aroma and flavor. Holy basil has green stems, whereas Thai Basil has purple stems; holy basil is slightly hairy, whereas Thai Basil is smooth and hairless; holy basil does not have the strong aniseed or licorice smell of Thai Basil; and Holy Basil has a hot, spicy flavor sometimes compared to cloves.
 Considered sacred and purifying to Hindus
