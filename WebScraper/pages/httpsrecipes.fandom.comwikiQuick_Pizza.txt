 Description : 
 
I cannot take credit for this recipe but neither can I provide the source as it has existed on a scrappy piece of paper for the last 25 or so years. 

No lengthy yeast dough to make for this recipe, a savory scone mixture provides the base for the pizza topping. Serve warm from the oven. Quick, easy and cheap to make but it doesn't skimp on flavor and of course you can be as creative as you like with your choice of toppings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 
For the base:

8oz/225g  self-raising flour 

1 level teaspoon  baking powder 

half a teaspoon salt

1\4 pint milk

1oz butter

2oz hard cheese finely grated


For the topping:

2 tablespoons of  olive oil 

1 medium sized onion finely chopped

2 tablespoons  tomato pur√©e  

generous pinch of  oregano 

salt and pepper to taste



 
 Directions : 
 
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together. Rub in the butter and add the grated cheese. Stir in the milk and using a fork mix to a rough dough in the basin. Turn out on to a floured surface and knead lightly until smooth. Cover and rest in a cool place for l0 minutes while preparing the topping.

Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently for a few moments until softened but not brown. Stir in the tomato puree, the herbs and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Cook for a moment and then draw off the heat.

Roll out the prepared scone dough to a circle of about 9 inches (23 cm.) in diameter. Slide on to a greased baking tray. Spread the tomato mixture over the surface right to the edges. Sprinkle gently with the grated
cheese and anything else you wish to add. Place in the center of hot oven (425'F/220"C/ Gas Mark 7) and bake for
20-25 minutes or until well risen. Cut into wedges and serve warm.
