 Description : 
 SERVES: 6
This hearty soup, made from the kinds of basic  grains  and legumes every Tunisian housewife has in her larder, is remarkably easy to put together. The seasonings, added at the end of the cooking time, give the soup depth.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup dried  Chickpeas  (6 ounces), soaked overnight and drained 
 3/4 cup coarse  bulgur  (5 ounces), rinsed 
 1 cup small dried split fava beans (6 ounces) 
 2 quarts  water 
 1 cup extra-virgin  olive oil , plus more for serving 
 2 tablespoons  tomato  paste 
 1 tablespoon harissa 
 1 tablespoon tabil 
 2 teaspoons sweet  paprika 
 3  garlic  cloves, minced 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the  Chickpeas ,  bulgur , favas,  water  and 1 cup of  olive oil  and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the  Chickpeas  and fava beans are completely broken down, about 4 hours. 
 Stir in the  tomato  paste, harissa, tabil,  paprika  and  garlic  and simmer for 5 minutes longer. 
 Season with  salt  and serve, passing extra  olive oil  at the table.
