Description : 
 This soup is really wonderful, I did triple the  garlic  and add more  red pepper flakes , but this does not taste like diet food (but it in fact it is)! Enjoy! Use  vegetable broth  to make this vegetarian/vegan.
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â½ lbs  Swiss chard  or  escarole  or  beet leaves , trimmed (i used  kale ) 
 6 cups  chicken broth  or  vegetable broth  (i used half of each) 
 1-5 cloves  garlic  (I'm sure I used at least 5!) 
 1 cup cooked  white beans  or canned  white beans  (i used  great northern beans ;  cannellini  or other  white beans  would work too) 
 kosher salt , to taste 
 white pepper , to taste 
 freshly grated  Parmesan cheese  (to finish) 
 red pepper flakes  (for garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Bring large pot of  water  to a boil. 
 Boil greens for about 5 minutes, just till tender, and then plunge into  water  to stop cooking. 
 Squeeze out as much  water  as possible and set aside (you can do this step before you make the rest of the soup.). 
 Bring broth to simmer in large pot over med-high heat. 
 Add  garlic  and greens, and  beans  (if using canned, rinse and drain to rid the excess sodium!) Simmer gently for about ten minutes, partially covered. 
 Sprinkle with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Ladle soup into bowls. 
 Pass  cheese  and  pepper  flakes at table.
