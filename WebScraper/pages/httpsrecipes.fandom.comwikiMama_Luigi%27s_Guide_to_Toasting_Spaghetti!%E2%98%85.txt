 Toasting Spaghetti in a Frying Pan : 
 Toasting a batch of freshly cooked spaghetti is my go-to preferred method for this delicacy. All you need are the following finest Italian ingredients in your cabinet:
 
 A drizzle of oil to toast/fry the spaghetti 
 A batch of cooked spaghetti - any kind (regular, gluten free, bean) will work 
 A pinch of salt and pepper on hand 
 Tomato sauce when the spaghetti is ready! 
 Grated Parmesan cheese for that "Mama Luigi's Toaster" flavor 
 Lightly oil the pan and turn the heat on MEDIUM. 
 Toss in that spaghetti! Hope you made  lots  of it! 
 Fry the spaghetti to your desired toasty-ness. Just don't burn it, or it'll smell like a toaster on fire. 
 Season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper. Nobody wants tasteless pasta... 
 When the spaghetti is ready, pour it into a big bowl and dump on that tomato sauce! 
 Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve. 
 Toasting Spaghetti in a... um, Toaster! (RATHER DANGEROUS) : 
 The perilously classic method of toasting a moist, dense clump of spaghetti. Don't forget all the fixings once it pops out the toaster!
 ~WARNING~ The clump could burn and start a fire... inside the toaster! I urge you not to try this at home. 
 All you're gonna need are the following ingredients:
 
 A moist, dense clump of cooked spaghetti 
 A toaster (really obvious, heh?) 
 A pinch of salt, pepper and oregano for that light 'salad' flavor, you know that! 
 Alright, Here's the... Um, Recipe in a Toaster! : 
 To keep it simple n' easy, put the clump into the toaster and pull the toaster's button down to toast. On TV, toast (and spaghetti!) pops right out the toaster and onto the wall. But thanks, gravity. It doesn't work that way in real life. Might as well need a pair of tongs and pull them out yourself. 
 Now that you've toasted your spaghetti, top it with whatever you want, whether it be salt and pepper, avocado and olive oil, or classic tomato sauce or Alfredo sauce.
