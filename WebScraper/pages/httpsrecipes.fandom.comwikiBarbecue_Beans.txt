Description : 
 These saucy beans are ready in less than 40 minutes--a fraction of the time it takes to make traditional baked beans. If you'd like more of a smoky taste, use a mesquite-flavored barbecue sauce; if you prefer a milder flavor, use a regular tomato-based barbecue sauce. Check the beans for doneness after they've cooked for 6 minutes; if they're still a bit firm, simmer them (not under pressure) until tender.
