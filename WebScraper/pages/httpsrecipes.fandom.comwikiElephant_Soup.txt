Description : 
 In African villages, a successful hunt means a share of fresh meat for everyone. After traveling in equatorial Africa one observer wrote,  "...the gorge they all go in for after a successful elephant hunt is a thing to seeâ€”once" . (Mary Kingsley, Travels in West Africa, 1897.) There can still be more meat than can be immediately consumed, especially when there are no refrigerators or freezers, so a tradition of preserving meat by drying or smoking has developed throughout Africa. Dried meat, called biltong (similar to jerky) is often eaten as is. If possible, obtain real African biltong (from an international or African import grocery store). There are many websites with recipes telling how to make your own biltong. South Africans in particular are sensitive about comparing African biltong to American  Beef  jerky.
