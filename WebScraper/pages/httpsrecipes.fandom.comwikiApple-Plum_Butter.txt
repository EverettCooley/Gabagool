Apple-Plum Butter
 2 lb Slightly underripe red plums
- quartered
2 lb Tart apples, quartered
2 c Unsweetened, unfiltered
- apple juice
2 ts Ground cinnamon
 Combine plums, apples and juice in a heavy non-aluminum saucepan. Bring to
a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer 25
minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and cook until fruit is very
tender, stirring stirring occasionally (20-30 minutes).
 Cool slightly. Force fruit through food mill fitted with medium blade,
discarding peel and seeds. (or you can do as I do, seed and pit the fruit
BEFORE cooking. Then, when you reach this stage, all you have to do is run
it through a food processor) Return puree to pan, add sugar and cinnamon.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. (careful, mixture
can scorch easily!) Reduce heat and simmer briskly until butter is thick
and glossy, stirring frequently (about 40 minutes). Remove from heat, spoon
into hot sterilized jars and seal. Makes 3 pints jars or 6 - 8oz jars.
