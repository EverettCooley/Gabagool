 About Tarragon : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Tarragon on Wikipedia 
 Tarragon or dragon (Artemisia dracunculus) is a perennial herb, a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and a close relative of wormwood.
 Tarragon is a perennial plant that has narrow leaves, approximately two inches in length, which grow on a woody stem. There are two types of tarragon, French and Russian.
 
 Russian tarragon : 
 Russian tarragon has hairy leaves that are narrower and lighter green in color. Its taste is drier, bitterer and stimulates the appetite. For best results, tarragon should be used freshly picked since it wilts almost immediately and dried tarragon loses some of its aroma and taste.
