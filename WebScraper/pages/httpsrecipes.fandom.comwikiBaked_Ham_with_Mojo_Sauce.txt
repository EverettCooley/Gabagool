 Brush the  ham  with the  mustard  and sprinkle it with the  brown sugar . 
 Pour 1 cup of the  Mojo Sauce  over the top. 
 Bake in the center of the heated oven for 2 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest portion (not touching bone) registers 140°F (about 15 – 18 minutes per pound), basting every 20 – 30 minutes, alternating with ¼ cup each  white wine  and remaining  Mojo Sauce .
