 Instructions : 
 Heat water to 115°F. Dissolve yeast and sugar in water, allow to proof for 5-10 minutes.  
 In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine flour and salt. With mixer running on low, add in yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a ball forms. Knead by hand if necessary. Dough may also be mixed by hand in a large bowl. Transfer to a greased medium bowl, cover and allow to rise until doubled in size, roughly 1 hour.  
 Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with baking spray or olive oil.  
 In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook shaved steak until nearly done. Drain and set aside.  
 In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes. Microwave for 15-30 seconds or until fragrant.  
 Stretch dough to desired shape and size on prepared baking sheet. Brush garlic oil over dough. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Top off with cooked shaved steak and raw vegetables. Sprinkle with mozzarella and provolone cheese. Finish off with a dusting of ground black pepper.  
 Bake for 15-20 minutes or until desired crispness. Slice and serve warm.
