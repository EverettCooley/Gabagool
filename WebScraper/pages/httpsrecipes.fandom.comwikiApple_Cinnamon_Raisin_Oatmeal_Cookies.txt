      Apple Cinnamon Raisin Oatmeal Cookies     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  spelt  or  whole wheat flour 
 1 cup  rolled oats  ( oatmeal ), ground 
 1½ cups  raisins , seedless 
 2  apples 
 1 tbsp  cinnamon 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 350 °F (175 °C). 
 Place the  spelt , or whole  wheat flour , and the ground  rolled oats  ( oatmeal ) in a bowl and mix together. (The  rolled oats  can be ground in a blender on high speed. Be sure that the container is dry before grinding.) 
 Add the  cinnamon  and mix. 
 Add 1 cup of the  raisins  and mix well to ensure that the  raisins  are separated and each one is coated with the  flour  mixture. 
 Wash the  apples  and cut into quarter sections. 
 Remove and discard the cores. 
 Place  apple  sections in the blender container. 
 Add the remaining ½ cup of  raisins  and blend at high speed until all the  raisins  are thoroughly ground and blended with the  apples . 
 Add the pureed  apples  and  raisins  to the  flour  mixture and mix thoroughly with a stiff spatula or spoon. 
 If the cookie dough is too stiff, you may add another pureed  apple  or a little  apple juice . A thinner dough will make a flatter cookie. A stiff dough will make irregular thick cookies like the ones shown in the photo. 
 On a non-stick or lightly oiled baking sheet, place the cookie dough in twelve equal sized "mounds." 
 Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake at 350 °F for 20 to 25 minutes. 
 Various ovens bake differently, so we suggest that you begin checking the cookies after 15 and 20 minutes of baking. 
 When the apple cinnamon raisin oatmeal cookies are baked, remove from the oven, cool, and enjoy.
