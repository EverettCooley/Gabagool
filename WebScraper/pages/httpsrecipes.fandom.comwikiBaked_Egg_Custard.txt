BAKED EGG CUSTARD
 
  4 eggs
 2 1/2 c. milk
 1-2 c. sugar
 Vanilla
 Nutmeg
 
 Place all ingredients in a saucepan. Beat together. (The
secret of this custard is to beat gently until everything
is just thoroughly mixed). Heat the mixture until hot, but
not boiling. Place in baking dish, sprinkle more nutmeg
over the top if desired and bake in a 325 degree oven for
40 minutes.
 Enjoy.
