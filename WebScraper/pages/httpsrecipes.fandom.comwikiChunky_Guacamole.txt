 Description : 
 Not all guacamole is created equal! The best part about this guac is the texture combined with the taste.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ripe  California avocados 
 4 cloves of  garlic  (to taste) 
 Â½ a  lemon  or one whole  lime 
 1 small  Onion  (2 - 3") 
 1  tomato  (about 3") 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 The key to this recipe is TEXTURE. Other than the  avocado  and  garlic  (which should be mashed smooth), all the ingredients should be chopped chunky, and allowed to stay that way.
 Take two California avocadoes (they should be dark green, and just slightly mushy), cut them in half, pop out the pit and scoop out the flesh with a spoon.
 Crush cloves of  garlic , and put on the  avocado .
 Squeeze the half  lemon  (or all of a  lime ), and then go by taste (it's easy to overdo the  lemon  part). Then mash all this together until it's smooth. You may wish to scrape the inside of  lemon  or  lime  so that there's pulp included as well.
 Chop up a small  Onion  and put it in, along with about half a normal size  tomato 
 Give it a little more mashing and stirring, then cover the bowl and put it in the fridge. If you give it about an hour, the  garlic  will seep through and blend the flavors together.
 Eat with nacho chips.
