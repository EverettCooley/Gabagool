Description : 
Made with real spices and sugar for moderate-quality zest, this bacon dish is great for lunch or dinner and delivers a bold aroma that it relishes. Keep the bacon baking to get a red-hot flavor from the barbecue. Barbecue sauce rarely works for this, too.         
 Ingredients : 
 5 tablespoons light brown sugar 
 1 tablespoon chili powder 
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
 ¼ teaspoon ground red pepper 
 12 thick bacon slices 
 vegetable cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350° C. Stir together brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, and ground red pepper. Dredge bacon slices in sugar mixture, pressing to adhere. 
 Arrange bacon in a single layer on a wire rack coated with cooking spray; place in an aluminum foil-lined jelly-roll pan. 
 Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crisp. Serve hot and plain or with other side dishes.
