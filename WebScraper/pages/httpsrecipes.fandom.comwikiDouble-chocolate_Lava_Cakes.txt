 ¾ cup  butter 
 6 oz  semisweet chocolate  pieces (1 cup) 
 1 recipe  praline sauce  (see below) 
 3  eggs 
 3  egg yolks 
 ⅓ cup  sugar 
 1½ tsp  vanilla 
 ⅓ cup  all-purpose flour 
 3 tbsp unsweetened  cocoa  powder 
 ⅓ cup  pecan  halves, toasted 
 Praline Sauce : 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 ⅓ cup packed  brown sugar 
 2 tbsp  dark colored corn syrup 
 ½ cup  whipping cream 
 Directions : 
 Heat oven to 400°F. 
 Lightly grease and flour six 1- to 1¼-cup soufflé dishes or six 10-oz custard cups. 
 Place souffle dishes or custard cups in a shallow baking pan and set pan aside. 
 In a heavy small saucepan melt butter and semisweet chocolate over low heat, stirring constantly. 
 Remove from heat and cool. 
 Meanwhile, prepare praline sauce, cover and keep warm until needed. 
 In a large mixing bowl beat eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer on high speed about 5 minutes or until thick and lemon colored. 
 Beat in cooled chocolate mixture on medium speed. 
 Sift flour and cocoa over chocolate mixture; beat on low speed just until combined. 
 Divide batter evenly into prepared dishes or cups. 
 Bake 10 minutes. 
 Pull cakes out of oven. 
 Using a small spatula or table knife, puncture top of each partially-baked cake and gently enlarge to make a dime-sized hole. 
 Slowly spoon about 1 tbsp praline sauce into center of each cake. 
 Return cakes to oven. 
 Bake 5 minutes more or until cakes feel firm at the edges. 
 Cool in dishes on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 
 Using a small spatula or knife, loosen cake edges from sides of dish or cup and slip cake out upright onto individual dessert plates. 
 Stir ⅓ cup toasted pecan halves into the remaining praline sauce. 
 If necessary, stir 1 to 2 tbsp hot water into remaining sauce to thin. 
 Spoon warm praline sauce on top of cakes. 
 Top with pecan halves and sweetened whipped cream. 
 Serve immediately. 
 Praline Sauce : 
 In a heavy medium saucepan combine sugar, brown sugar and corn syrup. 
 Stir in whipping cream. 
 Cook over medium-high heat until boiling, stirring constantly to dissolve sugar. 
 Reduce heat. 
 Cook, uncovered, 10 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally.
