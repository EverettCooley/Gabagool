Indiana Breakfast. These are great served with syrup, also  sausage  or  bacon .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  cornmeal 
 2 quarts boiling water 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Moisten the cornmeal with a little water and stir into the boiling water. 
 Cook over a low heat, for 45 minutes, stirring often. Most of the cornmeal sold today has been processed to cook much faster, so follow the directions. 
 Pour the hot cornmeal into a greased (I use a "Pam" type product) loaf pan or glass baking dish and let stand, uncovered, until cold and firm. (Can be refrigerated over night) 
 Cut into slices, dip in flour and fry in hot fat until browned.
