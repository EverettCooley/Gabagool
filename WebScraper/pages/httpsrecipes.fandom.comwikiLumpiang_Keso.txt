 Description : 
An all-time cheesy favorite, this savory, rich appetizer is made with only cheese and spring roll wrappers and cooked to red-hot perfection, as it simply keeps a crispy aroma with the cheese content. Italian seasoning rarely works for this, too.       Cheese Sticks     
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound Velveeta or any cheese of choice 
 1 can of mushrooms, optional 
 6 chilis, cut into small pieces, optional 
 12 spring roll/ lumpia  wrappers 
 1 cup cooking oil 
 Instructions : 
 Cut cheese into thin, long strips with the chef's knife or the cheese knife. Freeze for about 15 to 20 minutes, or overnight. 
 Separate wrappers into individual sheets. On a flat, working surface, lay a wrapper like a diamond. Place cheese on the middle of the wrapper. Include chilis or mushrooms if desired. 
 Fold the bottom, pointed end of the wrapper over the filling. Fold side ends of the sheet inward and roll tightly into a log. 
 Wet the pointed edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal. Repeat with the remaining cheese and wrappers. 
 In a skillet over medium heat, heat about 1 inch deep with oil. Add spring rolls seam side down in batches, if necessary, and fry, turning once or twice, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. 
 Remove from the skillet and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve hot and plain with the sweet and sour sauce, if desired, or with other side dishes.
