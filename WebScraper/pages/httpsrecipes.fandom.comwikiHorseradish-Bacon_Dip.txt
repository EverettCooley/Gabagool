 Description : 
This spiced dip is made with real horseradish and mixed with bacon for great zest. For a tangy, bold aroma kept with the horseradish, chili powder rarely works for this, too.       Horseradish-Bacon Dip     
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups shredded cheese (Cheddar, Parmesan, Reggianito, Bergenost, Mozzarella, or Colby) 
 1 cup sour cream 
 1 ¾ cup crumbled or chopped, cooked bacon 
 2 tbsp. horseradish sauce  or  (½ cup grated real horseradish) 
 2 tbsp. chopped, fresh chives 
 Directions : 
 Place cheese, sour cream, bacon, and horseradish sauce in a blender or food processor's container; cover. 
 Blend until smooth. Mix up with the chives and cover. 
 Refrigerate at least 1 hour to allow flavors to blend. Serve as a spread with crackers or a dip with corn, potato, or tortilla chips or other appetizers, side dishes, or main dishes.
