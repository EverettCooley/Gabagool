 Wikipedia Article  About Sucanat on Wikipedia 
 Sucanat (which is a contraction of  Su gar  Ca ne  Nat ural) is non-refined cane sugar that has not had the molasses removed from it like refined white sugar. It is essentially pure dried sugar cane juice. It is generally accepted as a substitute for brown sugar. Unlike regular brown sugar, sucanat is grainy instead of crystalline.
