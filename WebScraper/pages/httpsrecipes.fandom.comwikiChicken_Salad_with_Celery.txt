The Americans have invented many attractive salads combining meat or poultry with chopped vegetables and appropriate fruits. There are epicurean puritans who reject such cooking practices as highly objectionable; nevertheless, Americans are not alone in their liking for these unusual salad combinations. Connoisseurs in many other countries seem to enjoy them also. Americans use  chicken  in a wide variety of salad combinations. Here, for example, is a refreshing salad using leftover cooked  chicken  with fruits and vegetables.
