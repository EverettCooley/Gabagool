Description : 
 "Bride's fingers". These lovely slender crisps of  filo  filled with sweetened  nuts  are as heavenly as baklava, much easier to prepare and to eat, and lower in calories and fat.  nuts  provide protein and healthy quantities of fiber, as well as containing traces of many important elements necessary to good health.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ package (16 oz) frozen  filo dough , completely defrosted 
 ¼ cup  unsalted butter , melted (optional) 
 Sweet syrup : 
 2 cups granulated  sugar 
 2 cups  water 
 2 teaspoons  lemon juice 
 Filling : 
 ½ cup  almonds  or  pistachios , pulverized in food processor with 
 ⅓ cup  sugar 
 Glaze : 
 1  egg , beaten 
 sugar 
 Directions : 
 Prepare the syrup in advance and chill in the refrigerator. 
 Combine the filling ingredients. 
 Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease 1 or 2 baking sheets. 
 Cut the  filo  in half crosswise and again in half, stacking the covering with a slightly dampened towel to prevent drying. Lay 2 rectangles on your work surface with the shorter sides facing you, and brush lightly with melted  butter . 
 Place a rounded tablespoon of the filling in a line across the shorter side of  filo  that faces you. Fold the longer edges of the pastry inward, sealing in the sides of the filling, and roll the pastry up from the short side, forming a fat cigar shape. Place on the baking sheet with the cut edge down. Repeat with remaining dough. 
 Brush the tops of the pastries lightly with a bit of beaten  egg  and sprinkle with  sugar . 
 Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. 
 Dip the warm fingers into cool sweet syrup and arrange on a serving tray. Serve at room temperature.
