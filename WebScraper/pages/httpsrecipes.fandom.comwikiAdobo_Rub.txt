Description : 
 Eddie Diaz likes to use this Caribbean-flavored rub on pork shoulder, whole chicken and turkey. The optional sazon seasoning adds a peppery-salty flavor (its main ingredient is MSG). If you don't have fresh oregano, substitute 1 teaspoon dried oregano.
 To use this rub, make shallow cuts in the meat or poultry, and spread the rub over all and into the crevices to coat evenly. Cover the meat and refrigerate for at least 1 or hour or preferably overnight before cooking.

 Adapted from Eddie Diaz, who was taught how to make this by his mother. 
 Makes 1½ cups (enough for whole chicken or pork shoulder) 
 Ingredients : 
 6 to 7 cloves  garlic , coarsely chopped 
 ¼ cup coarsely chopped  flat-leaf parsley 
 ¼ cup coarsely chopped  cilantro 
 1 tablespoon  oregano 
 3 tablespoons  salt 
 3 tablespoons crushed  black pepper 
 ½ cup  white vinegar 
 ½ cup  vegetable oil 
 2 packets (a scant 1 tablespoon total) Sazón seasoning blend with coriander and  achiote  (annatto), such as Goya brand (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a blender or food processor, add the garlic, parsley, cilantro, oregano, salt and pepper and pulse to combine. 
 Add the vinegar, oil and Sazón packets, if desired, and pulse to combine. 
 The texture should be paste-like but slightly runny. 
 At this point, the rub is ready to use on meat or poultry, or store in a tightly covered container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
