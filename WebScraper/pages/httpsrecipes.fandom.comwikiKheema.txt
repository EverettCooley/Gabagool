 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Just get the following stuf together:
 
 2 packets (say 800 grams of lean minced  Lamb ) 
 4 medium  potatoes  - chopped into bite-sized chunks 
 2 medium  onions  chopped finely 
 1 tin of chopped  tomatoes 
 Half a bowl of frozen  Peas 
 The usual chunks  ginger , chillie,  garlic  from your freezer (thawed of course) 
 2 (heaped) teaspoons ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 3(heaped) teaspoons  garam masala 
 1 and a half teaspoon of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cumin 
 Directions : 
 So: get a largish pot - and heat up a couple of tablespoons of your usual  vegetable oil  in it - we use cholesterol-free  sunflower oil . Get the chopped  Onion  frying until they are golden brown. Then add the pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie to the pot and continue frying on medium heat.
 
       Fry onion in oil until golden-ish     
         Add garlic/ginger/chillie pulp     
 After a few minutes of frying - add the minced  Lamb  - and fry it until browned.
 
         Add the minced lamb and fry     
         Browned minced lamb     
 Then add all the dry spices - and stir-fry it all - until the browned meat is all coated well. Then add the tin of chopped  tomatoes  and stir it all about.
 
         Add the dry spices and fry     
         Add the chopped tomatoes     
 After a few mins - add the chopped  potatoes  - and also pour in a glass of  water . Stir it all - and bring to a fierce boil so that the  potatoes  will cook. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for around half hour.
 
         Add the chopped patatoes     
         Stir the mixture well     
 After about half hour of simmering - add the frozen  Peas .
 
         Put on low flame and simmer for about half an hour     
         Add the frozen peas
