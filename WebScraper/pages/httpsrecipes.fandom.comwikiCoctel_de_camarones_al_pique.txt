 Description : 
 Hot  Shrimp  Cocktail
 
 Ingredients : 
 50-60 medium size  Shrimp , peeled and deveined. Always at their best when fresh. If frozen, thaw quickly under running tap  water . If canned, drain. In all cases, rinse in tap  water  and set on paper towel to drain excess moisture. 
 1/2 cup  white wine 
 1/2 teaspoonful ground  garlic 
 1 teaspoonful of  parsley  flakes 
 1/3 teaspoonful ground  oregano 
 1/3 teaspoonful ground Italian red pepper 
 Directions : 
 Blend all the ingredients together. If possible, use the same dish for cooking and serving, to preserve the light gravy. 
 If you have time to spare, allow the  Shrimp  to marinate in the mixture for about four hours, covered, in your refrigerator. Marination works wonders for this dish. 
 Microwave for about 4 minutes on HIGH or cook in the range over medium to medium high heat for about eight minutes. Stir at least once throughout the cooking process.  Shrimp  are ready to eat when their color is paper white and you can no longer see through their skins.
