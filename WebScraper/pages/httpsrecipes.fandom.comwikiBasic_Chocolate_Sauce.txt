Basic Chocolate Sauce
 
 
   2      ounces        Semisweet baking chocolate
  2      tablespoons   Butter
    1/2  cup           Boiling water
  1 1/2  cups          Sugar
  1      teaspoon      vanilla
         dash          salt

 
 Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Stir in butter, then boiling
water, then sugar and salt. Cook stirring occasionally, for 15
minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
 The sauce is best when served warm. Either serve immediately or
reheat in double boiler for 10 minutes or microwave for 1 minute.
To store pour into strilized glass jars. Allow sauce to cool
before refrigerating. It will keep for 6 months in the
refrigerator.
