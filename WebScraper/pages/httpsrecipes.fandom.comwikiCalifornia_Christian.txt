Description : 
 The California Christian is a hamburger created by Christian Williams, the co-inventor of the  Bacone . Less of a creation or an invention, the California Christian simply requires the presence of a few key items.
 
 Ingredients : 
 a plain  burger 
 Bacon 
 Avocado 
 Pepper jack cheese 
 Non-Ingredients : 
 Just as important as what's in a California Christian is what's  NOT  in a California Christian. There may be no  tomatoes  or  mushrooms , or the burger will cease to be a California Christian.
