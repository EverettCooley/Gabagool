 oil 
 1 lb  new potatoes 
 1 good-sized  sweet potato  or  yam  (6-8 inches long) 
 1 mild tasting  Apple  (Golden Delicious is good), sliced or chopped 
 4  eggs , hard cooked, sliced 
 1/2 cup  green peas , cooked until still slightly firm 
 1/2  red onion , finely chopped 
 1 can  asparagus  tips 
 3/4 cup  Mayonnaise 
 2 tbl  dill weed

 Directions : 
 Cut  tofu  into 1" squares, 1/2" thick. Coat with  nutritional yeast . 
 Fry in  oil  over medium heat until golden brown and slightly chewy. 
 Drain on paper towels. 
 Cut  potatoes  and  sweet potatoes  into 1" cubes. Boil until tender. 
 Drain. 
 Mix together  tofu ,  potatoes ,  Apple , 3 of the  eggs ,  Peas , and  Onion . 
 Add enough  Mayonnaise  to make it creamy or to taste. Add  dill weed , fresh if possible. Add enough  vinegar , prepared  mustard , or Durkee's Sauce (basically a mustard- vinegar  sauce) to give it a tang. 
 Garnish with additional  egg  and  asparagus  spears. Sprinkle with  paprika  for beauty. 
 Variations and substitutions: 
      Broil the  tofu  to reduce fat. It won't have a nicy chewy texture, though. Substitute  Chicken  for the  tofu  (as in the original recipe).
 
 Substitute plain, non-fat  yogurt  for some of the  Mayonnaise  to reduce fat content.
