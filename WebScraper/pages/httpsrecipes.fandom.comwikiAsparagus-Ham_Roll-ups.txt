Asparagus-Ham Roll-Ups
 2 Pkg. frozen asparagus -- (10 oz.)
2 Tbsp. flour
1/2 Tsp. dry mustard
6 Thin Slices cooked ham
1 C. processed Cheddar cheese -- (4 oz.) grated
2 Tbsp. butter or margarine
1/4 Tsp. salt
1 C. milk
 Cook asparagus until just tender. Melt fat in heavy
saucepan. Stir in flour, salt and mustard. Gradually stir in
milk. Cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Add cheese
and continue stirring until cheese is melted. Divide asparagus
into 6 portions. Place asparagus portions on and parallel to
narrow end of each ham slice. Roll as for jelly roll with
asparagus in the center of each roll-up. Arrange roll-ups in a
baking dish with seam side down. Pour sauce over roll-ups.
Bake at 350 degrees until sauce is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
Note: I always use fresh asparagus in season. And, I
use the microwave to cook the asparagus and heat the roll-ups.
Cook the prepared roll-ups on medium for 7 to 10 minutes.
 Enjoy.
