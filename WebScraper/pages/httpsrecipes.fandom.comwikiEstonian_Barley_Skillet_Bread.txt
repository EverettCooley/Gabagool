Description : 
 This flatbread, is a traditional Estonian staple. Normally it is eaten straight from the oven, slathered with  butter , honey, or---more traditionally—lingo berry preserves. It tastes even better the next day.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 tablespoons  unsalted butter  (melted) 
 1 and 1/2 cups  barley flour 
 1/2 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/3 cup whole- wheat flour 
 2 tablespoons packed  brown sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1/2 teaspoon  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  caraway seeds  (optional) 
 1 large  egg , beaten 
 1 cup  buttermilk 
 2 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 1.	Strain the dry ingredients and  caraway seeds  (if using) together in a large dish.
 2.	Whisk together the  egg ,  buttermilk , and  vegetable oil .
 3.	Add the dry ingredients and mix until blended. Do not over mix. You will get something between batter and dough.
 4.	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush an 8 inch cast-iron skillet with the  butter .
 5.	Spoon the mixture into the skillet and smooth top with a rubber spatula.
 6.	 Sprinkle the remaining  butter  over the top.
 7.	Bake until golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean for about 50 minutes.
 Serving:
 Serve it slightly warm. Serving will be enough for 6.
