 36 pancakes 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups Original Bisquick™ mix 
 1 cup  milk 
 2  eggs 
 Directions : 
 Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375°F; grease with cooking spray, vegetable oil or shortening. 
 Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear. 
 Stir all ingredients until blended. 
 Pour by tablespoonfuls onto hot griddle to form dollar-size pancakes. 
 Cook until edges are dry. 
 Turn; cook until golden. 
 Total cook time may vary per batch. 
 Tip : 
 To make pancakes extra-special, stir ½ cup miniature chocolate chips or ¾ cup fresh or frozen, thawed and drained, blueberries into batter. These mini-cakes are just as good a 2nd time around. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers and reheat by wrapping in foil and warming about 10 min in 300°F oven.
