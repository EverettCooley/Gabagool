Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  vegetable shortening 
 1¼ cups  sugar 
 2  eggs , (large) 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 1 tsp  lemon extract 
 3 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1 tsp  nutmeg , (optional) 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  baking soda 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1 cup  sour cream 
 Directions : 
 Cream  shortening  and  sugar  together at medium speed until well blended. 
 Add  eggs  and flavorings, and beat at medium speed until creamy, scraping down the bowl before and after adding  eggs  and flavorings. 
 Stir  flour ,  nutmeg  if desired,  baking powder ,  baking soda  and  salt  together to blend well; add, along with  sour cream  to creamy. 
 Cover and refrigerate from 3 hours to overnight. 
 Return dough to room temperature. 
 Roll out on a lightly floured board to ¼" thick. 
 Cut with a 2½ round cutter or an equivalent (see note below). 
 Place dough on cookie sheets that have been sprayed with pan spray or lined aluminum foil. 
 Bake at 350°F for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cookies are lightly browned. 
 Remove them to a wire rack and cool to room temperature. 
 Notes : 
 Nutritive values for these cookies are based on the use of the 2½ round cutter and weight of a little over 1 ounce per cookie. You may use other cutters as long as the finished cookie weighs about 1 ounce per cookie, and you might even make a 2-ounce cookie and figure the nutritive value and exchanges as twice those for the smaller cookie. You may add flavorings other than  vanilla  and  lemon ; if add  nuts ,  raisins  and the like, however, you are altering the nutritive values and exchanges for each cookie.
