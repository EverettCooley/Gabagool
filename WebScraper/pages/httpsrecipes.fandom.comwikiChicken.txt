 About chicken : 
 Chicken  is the meat derived from chickens. It is the most common type of poultry on earth, and is prepared as food in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture throughout the world.
 Chicken is a type of domestic fowl raised for its flesh, eggs, and feathers. Chickens are slaughtered at different ages to be processed for different purposes and classified according to their use such as broilers, fryers, roasters, and stewers. Broilers and fryers are chickens that weigh 3 to 4 pounds, are 7 to 12 weeks old and are best used for broiling or fry cooking. As the chicken becomes 10 to 12 weeks old, weighs 2 to 5 pounds and gains more fat, they are referred to as roasters since they are most suitable for roasting or cooking on rotisserie grills. Stewing chickens, which weigh up to 7 pounds and are over 10 months old, are typically best for stewing or processing into canned chicken products.
 Typically, the muscle tissue (breast, legs, thigh, etc.),  liver ,  heart , and  gizzard  are processed for food. Chicken feet are commonly eaten, especially in  French  and  Chinese Cuisine . Chicken wings refers to a serving of the wing sections of a chicken.
 Exotic parts like pygostyle (chicken's buttocks) and testicles are commonly eaten in East Asia and some parts of South East Asia.
 Chicken  eggs  are commonly eaten.
