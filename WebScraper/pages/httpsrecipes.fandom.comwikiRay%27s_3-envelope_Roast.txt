Description : 
 Last night I again made this wonderful roast. This is the BEST EVER roast that you will ever have in my opinion. You can use this for a Pressure Cooker or a Slow Cooker. It is also versatile that you can use a  beef  or  pork  roast with it. Works either way and with either meats.
 This is a YUMMY YUMMY Roast! You will love it. And you can use the liquid for gravy or broth! Let me know if you try it! Ray

 Ingredients : 
 3 pound or so roast ( beef  or  pork ) last night I used a chuck roast. 
 1 envelope of dry  Italian salad dressing  mix 
 1 envelope of dry  ranch salad dressing  mix 
 1 envelope of dry brown  gravy  mix 
 water  - for a pressure cooker 1 cup  water  for slow cooker Â½ cup  water  in a slow cooker. 
 Directions : 
 Please note in a slow cooker you can cut in half the dry ingredients if you find it overpowering. In the pressure cooker use the whole envelopes. I prefer the whole envelopes in either method of cooking. Ok here is what you do. 
 Put the  water  in a measuring cup that is larger then the amount of  water  you are using. 
 Now add and mix all three envelopes of dry salad dressings. 
 Mix until blended completely or as best you can. 
 Brown the roast (if desired) I love mine browned in the CE 8-qt pressure cooker) add the meat to your cooker pour the  water   salad dressing  mixture over the roast now cook as usual. 
 In the CE pressure cooker I cooked it for 70 minutes and used quick release method can and probably should use natural but i am always in a hurry when making this as it smells so good! in the slow cooker cook it on high for about 4 hours on low about 8 hours.
