 Wikipedia Article  About Psyllium seed husks on Wikipedia 
 Psyllium seed husks, also known as ispaghula, are derived from the seeds of Plantago psyllium or Plantago ovata, expand and become mucilaginous when wet, and are used in common over-the-counter bulk laxative and fiber supplement products such as Metamucil.
 Psyllium seed husk is useful for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, dietary fiber supplementation, and diverticular disease. Recent research is also showing it to be promising in lowering cholesterol and controlling diabetes.
