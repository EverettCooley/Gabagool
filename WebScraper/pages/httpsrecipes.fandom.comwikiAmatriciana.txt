 Description : 
 Amatriciana is a simple, delicious sauce you can make while the water for your pasta is boiling! For centuries it was prepared with guanciale (dried cured pigs cheek) and grated local pecornio (sheep’s milk cheese) and was known as Gricia (from the village of Grisciano in central Italy). While tomato-less Gricia is still prepared in some parts, it is the tomato-enriched Amatriciana that has become a “classic” sauce all over Italy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 oz  cured pig's cheek  (guanciale di maiale)  or  fresh  pancetta , chopped 
 1 medium  onion , sliced 
 1 clove of  garlic 
 glug of  olive oil 
 12 oz  puréed tomatoes  (freshest, highest quality as possible) 
 grated  pecorino   or   Parmesan cheese 
 salt 
 chili flakes 
 bucatini   or   spaghetti 
 Directions :
