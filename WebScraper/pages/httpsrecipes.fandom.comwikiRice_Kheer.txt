Description : 
 Rice Kheer is a sweet dish prepared in many households across Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Basically, it is a sweet dessert and is taken along with the main meal or just after the meal. However, you may also have it for breakfast. For breakfast, prepare it in the previous night and keep it in the refrigerator. It can be taken hot soon after preparation or after being cooled in a refrigerator. However, once cooled, pleased don’t try to warm it as that will spoil it. It has good nutritional value as it combines the nutritional value of rice and milk. Please do not add sugar while cooking, and take it with honey after it is cooked.
