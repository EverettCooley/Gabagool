 Ingredients : 
 1½ lb  plain flour 
 1 packet  yeast 
 1 tsp  salt 
 2 tsps  Sugar 
 2 tbsps  olive oil 
 Filling:
 
 8 oz  Cheddar   Cheese 
 4 oz  Halloumi  or  mozzarella 
 1 tbsp  plain flour 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tbsp crushed dried  mint 
 4  eggs , lightly beaten 
 To Finish:
 
 1  egg , beaten 
 sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 Make the dough by sifting the  flour  into a large bowl. Stir in the  yeast ,  salt  and  Sugar . Add the  oil  and enough  water  to make a firm dough. 
 Knead for at least 5 mins. Put into a polythene bag and leave to rise in a warm place for an hour. 
 Make filling. Coarsely grate the cheeses, add  flour , and  baking powder  then gradually stir in the  mint  and beaten  eggs  until you have a stiffish paste. 
 Preheat the oven to 230 °C. Divide the dough into  egg  size pieces and roll into 4 " discs. Put a generous tbsp of filling in the centre of each disc and spread slightly. 
 Pull the dough up at 4 points to make a square. Press the corners together to seal and leave to rise. 
 Just before baking, brush with the beaten  egg  and sprinkle some  sesame seeds  over. Bake for 12-15 mins until the  Cheese  filling has puffed up and the pastry is golden. Serve warm or cold.
