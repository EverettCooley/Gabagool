 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh  oregano 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  pepper

 Divide mixture into 12 equal portions. 
 Lightly shape into patties. 
 Place 1 mozzarella ball in center of each patty. 
 Shape beef around cheese until completely enclosed inside forming meatballs. 
 Place meatballs on aluminum-foil-lined 15 x 10-inch baking pan. 
 Bake in 400°F oven 15 to 20 minutes to medium (160°F) doneness, until not pink in center and juices show no pink color. 
 Meanwhile heat pasta sauce in large saucepan until hot, stirring occasionally. 
 Add meatballs and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. 
 Spoon meatballs and sauce onto pasta. 
 Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon chopped oregano. 
 Garnish with oregano sprigs, if desired. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Dried oregano leaves may be substituted for fresh. Use 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves in meatball mixture. Add 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves to pasta sauce before heating.
