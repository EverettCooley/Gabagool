 About Gai choy : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Gai Choy on Wikipedia 
 Mustard greens (also known as green mustard cabbage), the leaves of the Indian mustard plant (Brassica juncea), are one of the greens considered to be an essential element in soul food. They are more pungent than the closely-related Brassica oleracea greens (kale, cabbage, collard greens, et cetera) and are very frequently mixed with these milder greens in a dish of "mixed greens", which can also often include wild greens such as dandelion. As with other greens in soul food cooking, they are generally flavored by being cooked for a long period with ham hocks or other smoked pork products. Mustard greens are also extremely high in Vitamin A and Vitamin K.
 Chinese and Japanese cuisines make much more use of mustard greens. A large variety of B. juncea cultivars are grown and enjoyed, such as zha cai (tatsoi), mizuna, juk gai choy, and hseuh li hung. Asian mustard greens are generally stir-fried or pickled. A South-East Asian dish called asam gai choy or kiam chai boey is often made with leftovers from a large meal. It involves stewing mustard greens with tamarind, dried chillies and leftover meat on the bone.
