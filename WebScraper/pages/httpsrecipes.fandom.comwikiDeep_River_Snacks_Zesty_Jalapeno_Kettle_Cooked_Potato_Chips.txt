Description : 
 According to the website for  Deep River Snacks  these chips are made using thicky sliced grade A  potatoes  which are cooked in natural oil. The chips contain no  cholesterol ,  MSG , artificial flavors, artificial preservatives or trans fats.
 A review at  taquitos.net  felt that the texture of the chips was inconsistent, varying from chip to chip. As for flavor, there was an initial "good spicy taste" (not specifically jalapeno) followed by a "good delayed jalapeno aftertaste".
