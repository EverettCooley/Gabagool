Serves : 2
 
 Ingredients 
 1 medium  sweet potato , about 8 ounces 
 3 tablespoons light  sour cream 
 2 tablespoons  marshmallow creme 
 1 tablespoon sweetened flaked  coconut 
 1 tablespoon chopped  pecans 
 4 teaspoons drained crushed  pineapple 
 4  dried apricot  halves, chopped 
 Directions 
 Preheat oven to 400 °F. Wash the sweet potato, pat dry and pierce in several places with a fork. 
 Bake for 45–50 minutes or microwave for 5–7 minutes, or until tender when pricked with a fork. Let cool slightly. 
 Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl; blend well. 
 Working lengthwise, slice sweet potato in half. Use a spoon to scoop out all but ¼ inch of the flesh from each half. 
 Place the scooped-out potato in a bowl, mash lightly with a fork; add about one-half of the ambrosia mixture to the mashed sweet potato; blend well. Spoon this mixture back into the potato skins and top each with the remaining ambrosia.
