There are over 15,000 known varieties of tea and you have to be a real connoisseur in order to be able to tell subtle differences between specific tea flavors apart. There are six main categories of tea â€“ four of the oldest categorized by color (black, white, red and green teas) as well as herbal tea and oolong tea. The subtle variations among the same tea category increased their numbers through time, but most of the famous tea types are a few thousand years old. Modern tea making also resorts to biological engineering of tea plants, in order to obtain better flavors, while traditional tea making resorted to selecting only the best tea bushes and improving them in time, through natural methods.
