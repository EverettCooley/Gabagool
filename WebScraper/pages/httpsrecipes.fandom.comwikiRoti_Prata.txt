 Description : 
 A mamak(Indian Muslim) specialty, this delicious bread is a popular round the clock snack served in many 24hr coffeeshops. There are several variations, either served plain or with  eggs /minced mutton and  Onion (called murtabak) wrapped in. While some like it with just a sprinkle of  Sugar . I like it served with a  curry  and a cup of Teh Tarik(strong Indian  milk  tea). Well made prata is light, crispy and not greasy.

 oil  the work top and work each ball into a very thin sheet - first flatten with your oiled palms, then thin further by pulling the edges(professionals do it by flipping the dough in the air in a circular motion), adding enough  oil  to prevent sticking.  oil  the surface and fold into a square ( egg  can be added before folding).
 Alternatively, you can thin out the sheet,  oil  and roll it up, coil in up like a sea shell, flatten and  oil  again and reapeat the flattening one or two more times.
