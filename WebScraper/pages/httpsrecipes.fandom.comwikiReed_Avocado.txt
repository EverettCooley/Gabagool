The reed avocado is smaller in size and it has a very intense green color and orange-like surface. Reed avocados grow abundantly in warm climates and when they are ripe, they get a gold flesh and a delicate, sweet and nutty flavor. The reed avocado is high in A and C vitamins and as well in important anti-oxidants that protect the human cells.
