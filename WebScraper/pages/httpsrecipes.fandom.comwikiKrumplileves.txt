 Potato soup
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 small whole stalk of  celery , cut in small pieces, about 2 cups 
 2  onions , peeled and chopped 
 2 tbsp chopped  parsley  leaves 
 3 tbsp  oil , (I use  corn  or  peanut oil ) 
 5 medium  potatoes , peeled and cut in small cubes 
 1 mild  pepperoni  sausage cut into 2 inch chunks 
 ¼ tsp  black peppercorns 
 4  bay leaves 
 2 quarts of  water 
 3 tbsp of good  white vinegar 
 6 raw  eggs 
 ½ pint of  sour cream 
 1 tsp  salt  ( celery  and the  vinegar  are naturally salty) 
 Directions : 
 In soup pot, sauté  celery  and  onions  in  oil  until limp. 
 Add to soup pot  parsley , potatoes, pepperoni chunks,  pepper   corns ,  bay leaves  and 2 quarts of  water . 
 Simmer slowly for at least one hour, until potatoes are soft. 
 Add the 3 tbsp of  vinegar . 
 Taste and if soup does not have enough  salt , add to taste. 
 While soup is simmering, break 6 raw  eggs , one  egg  at a time, into the pot. 
 Space them so they will cook to a firm stage, without touching one another. 
 Do not stir soup!. 
 Serve soup,  eggs  and chunks of  sausage  in each soup plate. 
 Put a heaping tablespoon of  sour cream  in each plate.
