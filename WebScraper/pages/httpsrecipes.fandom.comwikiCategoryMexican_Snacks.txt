 Quesadillas, tacos, burritos, enchiladas and tortillas are the most common Mexican snacks. Tacos are prepared with avocado, onions, potatoes, nachos or they are even prepared as taco pie with a special spiciness, taco sandwich with cheese cream and sour cream, hot peppers, veggies and salsa or taco treat as mini pinwheels. Burritos are prepared with black beans or refried beans, artichoke hearts, garlic, onions and tomatoes or as barbeque seitan black beans burrito. Beans are also used in quesadillas: their filling is cooked separately onto a cheese tortilla and then another tortilla covers the filling, which is afterwards heated in oil. Calabacitas (lunch, side dish or snack with cheese and tortillas), the sweet and buttery camotes al horno, baked yams, spinach and mushroom quesadillas, Mexican rice pilaf, cornucopia chili (with honey, kidney beans, cumin, cayenne and tomatoes), renellos or pasta poblano (with a puree made of onions, garlic and heavy cream) are other loved snacks.
