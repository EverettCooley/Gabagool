 Ingredients : 
 3  eggs 
 ½ pint  water  or  milk 
 4 ounces sweet- chestnut  purée 
 4 ounces  rice flour 
 4 ounces  cornmeal 
 pinch  salt  to taste 
 ½ teaspoon  bicarbonate of soda 
 ¼ teaspoon tartaric acid 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 ½ ounce  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  eggs , sweet- chestnut  purée,  oil  and  milk  together. 
 Mix all the dry ingredients. 
 Then quickly mix the wet and dry ingredients together. 
 You can usefully leave the mixture to stand for a couple of hours before cooking. 
 Cook on an iron griddle in the traditional way or heat a strong frying pan with enough  oil  to coat the bottom but no more. 
 The  oil  should not be hot enough to smoke. 
 Drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan. 
 After a few moments turn and flatten the pancakes slightly - they will rise again. 
 Cook until both sides are light brown. 
 Serve hot with  butter  and jam.
