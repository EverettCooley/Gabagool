 Smoothie making tips : 
 Drink too thick? Add more juice. 
 Drink too thin? Add more fruit or a couple ice cubes. 
 Drink too tart? Add a packet of artificial sweetener. 
 Drink too sweet? Add lemonade or a small spoonful of lemon juice. 
 Freeze the fruit first for a frostier drink. 
 Sweetened frozen fruit may make the drink too syrup like.
