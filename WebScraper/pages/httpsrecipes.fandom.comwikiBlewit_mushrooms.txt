 About Blewit mushrooms : 
 The blewit mushrooms are a specie characterized by a blue or purple care, in a middle size. The blewit word actually means blue hat, which describes the fungus’ appearance.

The blue or purple color maintains when these fungi are cooked, which is an unusual ability, but which helps in creating very aesthetic dishes: entrees, soufflés, salads or simple snacks. Another important characteristic of these mushrooms is the fact that they have a very particular and fresh smell, which previews the rich flavor of their flesh. This type of mushrooms grows both in open areas and under the trees, like oaks, acacias or eucalyptuses.
