Ingredients : 
 1.8 kilo  carrots 
 500 ml white  grape  concentrate 
 900 gram granulated  white sugar 
 1 teaspoon  citric acid 
 1 teaspoon  yeast  nutrient 
 1 teaspoon pectic enzyme 
 0,5 teaspoon  grape  tannin 
 13 mg vitamin B tablet 
 1 sachet of white  wine yeast 
 Directions : 
 Activate the  yeast  in a starter bottle. Wash, scrub and slice the  carrots  and bring them to boil in sufficient  water  to cover them completely. Let it simmer for 20 minutes (but not any longer than that the  carrots  are tender). 
 Strain the liquid into a fermenting bucket, discarding the  carrot  pulp. Add the  Sugar  to the hot liquid in the bucket and stir well to dissolve it. 
 Leave the liquid to cool to about 20°C, then stir in the  grape  concentrate and the other ingredients except for the  yeast . Cover and leave warm for 24 hours. 
 Add the activated  yeast  and ferment for 2 days before pouring it into a demijohn. After 2 days, pour into the demijohn and top it up to the shoulder with cooled, boiled water. Fit a bung and airlock and leave to ferment to dryness. 
 Move the demijohn to a cooler place and allow to clear and settle. Rack the wine as soon as a sediment appears. Rack again when necessary, topping it up with  apple juice . 
 This wine should be drinkable in about six to nine months.
