 Description : 
 An intense chocolate treat complemented with the flavorful nutrition of dried black currants. "Tessellation" refers to the natural surface texture caused by refrigerating the chocolate mixture and to the mosaic-like pieces created when the chilled chocolate is sliced into servings.
 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp  extra virgin coconut oil, warmed 
 1/2 cup  natural unsweetened cocoa 
 3 tbsp  black cherry juice concentrate (syrup) 
 2/3 cup  dried black currants 
 Directions : 
 In a small container, warm coconut oil* and stir in powdered cocoa. Add juice concentrate and stir well to blend flavors and create a smooth internal texture  (surface tessellation occurs naturally during refrigeration).  * Coconut oil should be very warm - not hot. 
 Line a flat bowl with wax paper (press a sheet of wax paper between two bowls). Evenly spread the dried currants on the wax paper, then gently pour on the warm chocolate mixture. Turn the second bowl upside down to use as a cover and refrigerate for several hours. 
 When the chocolate is firm in the center, slice into pieces and store in a covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.
