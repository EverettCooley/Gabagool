 Description : 
 I had an unusual hot and sour soup at a taiwanese restaurant in detroit, and made a copy which follows.
 
 Ingredients : 
 chicken broth 
 lemon grass 
 two tablespoons of Louisiana Hot Soss 
 julienne strips of white meat of  Chicken , sliced  Mushrooms , pea pods, scallions and a little bit of  bean sprouts 
 Directions : 
 I start off with  chicken broth , and when it is hot, I put in  lemon grass  and steep it like tea. While this is steeping, I add one or two tablespoons of Louisiana Hot Soss for the heat. When the broth is reasonably cool, I strain it, and put it back in the pot. Oh yes, while I am letting the grass steep, I prepare julienne strips of white meat of  Chicken , sliced  Mushrooms , pea pods, scallions and a little bit of  bean sprouts . Then I reheat the broth to a boil, and immediately take it off of the heat and put in the rest of the ingredients. In less than a minute, the soup is ready for serving.  salt  to taste.
