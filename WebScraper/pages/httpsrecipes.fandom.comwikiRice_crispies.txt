 About puffed rice : 
 Distinct from popcorn, which naturally pops and puffs itself with heating, puffed grain is created by placing whole grains under high pressure with steam. When the containment vessel's seal is suddenly broken, the entrained steam then flashes and bloats the endosperm of the kernel, increasing its volume through many times its original size. The puffed rice is usually made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam. Puffed rice is used in various breakfast cereals, and is also a popular street food in various parts of the world. It is an ingredient of bhel puri, a popular Indian chaat item. Puffed rice is referred to as mur mure in some parts of India. Puffed rice or other grains are occasionally found as street food in China, where peddlers implement the puffing process using an integrated pushcart/puffer featuring a rotating steel pressure chamber heated over an open flame. Used in side dishes, snacks and home meal solutions, the range of puffed rice offer time saving options in the preparation of various meals and snacks. Accessible in the medium and long-grain option, puffed rice grains are produced by controlled heat treatment.
