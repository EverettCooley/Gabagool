      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 There is nothing better to relax and de-stress than to do some cooking. At least that's what I do anyway. And this month has been so stressfully eventful - that I decided to waste away this Sunday afternoon preparing tonight's dinner. Indian-style fishcakes. Here's what you'll need
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2  eggs 
 3 or 4  spring onions 
 some freshly mashed  potato  - 3 medium sized ones will do 
 some firm  white fish  - no bones, no skin - I used  cod  fillets (around 350 grams) 
 some spices: 2 heaped teaspoons of  garam masala , one heaped of  ground coriander , 1 teaspoon of  salt 
 some pulped  ginger  - a couple of chunks from your freezer (thawed of course) 
 a couple of  red "bullet" chillies 
 some fresh  coriander leaf 
 and some  breadcrumbs 
 you will also need some  vegetable oil  to shallow fry the fishcakes in. 
 Directions : 
 First peel and chop the  potatoes  - and boil them until they are soft. Then drain and place into a bowl that you will subsequently mash them in after they have cooled down.
 
         
           
 Mash them up - and then set aside to cool. Whilst the  Potato  is cooling - prepare the fish. You can use whatever fish you like - I have used tinned  Tuna  before - but today I used frozen cod steaks - which you can easily find in the freezer section of your local supermarket. See the picture below for the sort that I used. It must be skinless and boneless - as this is so much easier to deal with.
 
           
           
 Just stick the frozen fish steaks in some foil in the oven - following the instructions on the packet - and open it all up when it is cooked so that it can cool down.
 
           
           
 By the time the fish is done and cooling - add the ground spices (and the pulped  ginger ) to the mashed  Potato  mix - and stir in thoroughly. Chop up the spring  Onion  and fresh red chillie - as finely as you can.
 
           
           
 Stir in the chillie and  Onion  into the spiced mash  Potato  mix - and also toss in a few sprigs of  coriander leaf . I used some previously frozen chopped coriander which we always keep in our freezer. Very convenient.
 
           
           
 Then - when the fish has cooled down - toss it into the mashed  Potato  bowl - and stir it all around so that the fish is flaked thoroughly. And then prepare two small bowls: crack the two  eggs  into one bowl - and beat them up - and then fill up another small bowl with breadcrumbs. Again - you can easily get hold of ready-to-go breadcrumbs from the supermarket - see the picture below for the stuff that used.
 
           
           
 What you need to do is to pour one  eggs  worth of the beaten  egg  mixture into the mashed  Potato  and fish bowl - and stir it all up with your hands. Then use your hands to scoop up the potato-fish mixture and roll into little patties - which you should then dip into the remaining beaten  egg  - and then dip into the breadcrumb bowl - turning over a few times to ensure that the fishcakes are covered in breadcrumbs evenly. When you have prepared all the fishcakes - heat up a frying pan with about 1Â cm deep of  sunflower oil  - and when it's hot - put the fishcakes carefully into the pan.
 
           
           
 Keep the fishcakes moving gently - and turn over a few times to ensure that they are evenly browned on all sides. When they are done - leave them to rest on a plate with absorbent kitchen paper - and then prepare your salad!
 
           
           
 I made a salad of cooked, thin, French beans,  red onion ,  tomato  and  cucumber  - all tossed in  balsamic vinegar  and French dressing. I reheated (baked) the fishcakes in the oven for about 15 minutes prior to serving - and then served them with the salad to a table surrounded by very hungry people.
 
           
           
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
