 Yield: 2 loaves 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups  whole wheat flour , divided 
 ½ cup  instant non-fat dry milk  powder 
 1 tablespoon  salt 
 2 (¼-ounce) envelopes  active dry yeast 
 3 cups water, divided 
 ½ cup  honey 
 2 tablespoons  butter   or   margarine 
 2 to 3 cups  all-purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 Beat 3 cups whole wheat flour, dry milk powder, salt, and yeast at low speed with a heavy-duty electric mixer until combined. 
 Bring 2 cups water to a boil over medium heat; add honey and butter, stirring until butter melts. 
 Remove from heat, and stir in 1 cup cold water (mixture will register about 120 °F) 
 Add honey mixture to flour mixture, beating at low speed 1 minute. 
 Increase speed to medium, and beat 2 more minutes. 
 Gradually add remaining wheat flour and enough all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. 
 Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes). 
 Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. 
 Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 °F), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. 
 Punch dough down, and divide into 2 equal portions. 
 Roll each portion into a 15- x 10-inch rectangle. 
 Roll each up jellyroll fashion, beginning with short end. 
 Fold ends under, and place each, seam side down, in a 9- x 5-inch loaf pan. 
 Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 °F), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. 
 Bake at 375 °F for 40 to 45 minutes, shielding with aluminum foil after 25 minutes to prevent excessive browning. 
 Note: equal amounts of whole wheat and all-purpose flour may be used.
