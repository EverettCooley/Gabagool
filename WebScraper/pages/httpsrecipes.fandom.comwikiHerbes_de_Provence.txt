 About Herbes de Provence : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Herbes de Provence on Wikipedia 
 Herbes de Provence (Proven√ßal herbs) is a mix of aromatic plants, typically but not always dried. These herbs are native to and have their origins in the Provence region of southern France. It is often sold in considerably larger bags, of two or three litres size, than the typical herb sale of a few millilitres. The price in Provence is also considerably lower than for typical herb sales in the Western world.
 The mixture traditionally contains rosemary, marjoram, basil, savory and thyme. Sometimes lavendar flowers are included in the mix. The proportion of each herb varies depending on the manufacturer, and additional aromatic plants are occasionally added. Typically thyme dominates the taste produced by the herb mixture.
 It is mostly used to flavour grilled foods such as fish and meat, as well as vegetable stews. The mixture can be added to foods before or during cooking or mixed with cooking oil prior to cooking so as to infuse the flavour into the cooked food. It is rarely added after cooking is complete.
