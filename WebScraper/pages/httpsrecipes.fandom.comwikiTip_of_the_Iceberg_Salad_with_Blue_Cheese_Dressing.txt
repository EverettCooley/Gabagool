 ⅓ cup  sour cream 
 1½ oz  blue cheese , at room temperature 
 1 tbsp fresh  lemon juice 
 freshly ground  black pepper  (lots) 
 ½ head  iceberg lettuce 
 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh  chives 
 2 slices cooked  bacon , chopped  or  ¼ cup toasted  walnuts  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a bowl, whisk the  mayo ,  sour cream ,  blue cheese ,  lemon juice  and  pepper  until well combined. 
 Cover and refrigerate. 
 Slice the  lettuce  into four equal wedges, without letting each wedge fall apart. 
 When you're ready to serve, place one wedge vertically on a salad plate with the outside larger leaves down and the center of the  lettuce  pointing up. 
 Add a hefty dollop of dressing, sprinkle with  chives  and  bacon  or nuts and repeat with three more plates.
