Description : 
 It is quite a long process but well worth the effort. The amount of sugar in the final stage can be varied according to taste.
 
 Ingredients : 
 
 For The Starter : 
 ½ oz  yeast 
 2 tsp  sugar 
 enough water to swell to between three and four tablespoons full (45-60 ml) 
 To Feed the "Plant" : 
 7 tsp ground  ginger 
 7 tsp  sugar 
 2 pints of water 
 To Flavour : 
 1½ lbs  sugar 
 juice of 2  lemons 
 Directions : 
 Stir the starter ingredients, cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours. This is your starter "plant". 
 Feed the "plant" with 1 teaspoon each of ground ginger and sugar each day. After 7 days, strain through a fine sieve. 
 Dissolve the sugar in 2 pints of water. 
 Add the lemon juice and the liquid from the "plant". 
 Dilute with 5 pints of water, mix well and store in corked bottles for at least 7 days. 
 Use strong bottles as pressure may build up which will cause thin bottles to explode. 
 For the same reason use corked bottles rather than those with a more secure closure that will not "give" under pressure.
