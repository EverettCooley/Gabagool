Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 medium  zucchini  ( ½ lb. each) 
 2 tbsp extra-virgin  olive oil 
 1 small  onion , finely chopped (about ½ cup) 
 ⅓ cup  TVP  flakes 
 ¾ tsp chopped fresh  thyme  or ¼ tsp dried 
 ¼ tsp ground  cinnamon 
 1 large  plum tomato , halved, seeded and chopped ( ⅓ cup) 
 1 tbsp  tomato paste 
 6  saffron  threads, soaked in 1 tsp. warm  water  (optional) 
 3 tbsp  currants 
 2 tbsp chopped fresh  Italian parsley 
 1½ tbsp grated  soy parmesan  or  Parmesan cheese 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 tbsp dry  bread crumbs 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375°F. 
 Halve each  zucchini  lengthwise. 
 To make  squash  halves sit securely, cut a thin, narrow 4-inch-long strip from bottom of each (strips should be as thin as if you were peeling  squash ) 
 Using teaspoon, scoop out flesh to make long, narrow channel down center of each  squash  half, removing only soft, seeded part. 
 Reserve enough scooped-out flesh to make 1 cup, then chop. 
 Discard remaining flesh or save for another use. 
 In medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of  oil  over medium-high heat. 
 Add  onion  and cook until transparent, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. 
 Add reserved  squash  and cook until slightly softened, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. 
 Add  TVP  flakes and cook, stirring, until coated with  oil . 
 Stir in  thyme  and  cinnamon . 
 Add  tomato  and cook until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. 
 Stir in  tomato  paste,  saffron  mixture if desired, ¼ cup  water ,  currants ,  parsley , and 1 tablespoon  soy cheese . 
 The filling will be moist. 
 Season to taste with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Place  squash  halves in square baking dish or ovenproof serving dish just large enough to hold them. 
 Pour ½ cup  water  into dish. 
 Spoon filling into each  squash  half, mounding slightly. 
 In cup, mix bread crumbs with remaining  soy cheese . 
 Sprinkle evenly over each stuffed  squash  half, then drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon  oil . 
 Bake until neck of  squash  is easily pierced with knife, about 45 minutes. 
 Let stand for 20 minutes before serving. 
 Alternatively, cool completely, cover with foil and set aside at room temperature; serve within 12 hours ( squash  will be less succulent if refrigerated).
