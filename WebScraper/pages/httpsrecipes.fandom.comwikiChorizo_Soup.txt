 Description : 
This meaty, rich soup is made with real chorizo, herbs, cheese, and vegetables, and delivers a red-hot, bold flavor. White beans rarely work for this, too.       Chorizo Soup     
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound firm-texture chorizo 
 1 large  onion , chopped, red, white, or yellow only  or  (5 tablespoons onion powder) 
 3 cloves garlic, minced  or  (5 tablespoons garlic powder) 
 ½ cup dehydrated  masa   flour  or yellow  cornmeal 
 3 diced roasted green chiles, skins and seeds removed,  or  (1 can chopped green chiles) 
 7 cups  chicken broth , store-bought or homemade 
 4 teaspoons paprika 
 ¾ cup shredded  jack cheese 
 ½ cup minced  cilantro 
 Directions : 
 Remove chorizo casings and crumble this into a 5- to 6-quart pan; just add the  onion  and garlic or the onion powder and garlic powder. Stir often over medium high heat until the meat and  onion  are browned, about 15 minutes. 
 Mix  masa  with the chorizo base, then stir in chiles, paprika, and the chicken broth. 
 Stirring often, bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer gently 20 minutes to blend flavors; stir frequently. 
 Skim fat from the surface as it accumulates and discard. 
 Ladle soup into bowls; just add the  cheese  and  cilantro  to taste. Serve warm and plain with any main dish, side dish, or appetizer.
