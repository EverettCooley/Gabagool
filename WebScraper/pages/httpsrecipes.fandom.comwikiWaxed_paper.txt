      Wax paper     
 Wax paper  (waxed paper) is a kind of paper that is made moisture proof through the application of wax. Wax paper should not be used for most baking as it will smoke, however it can be used in some baking as long as the batter completely covers the wax paper. Wax paper can be used to prevent splatters in microwave cooking. Because the paper is mostly unaffected by microwaves, it will not heat to the point of combustion under normal usage. This makes wax paper more functional than plastic wrap which will melt at lower temperatures, or aluminium foil (or tin foil) which is not safe for use in most microwave ovens.
