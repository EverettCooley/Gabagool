      Deep Fried Cajun Turkey     
 Made this for Father's day. You need a deep fryer, an injector and a thermometer for this. This must be made out doors away from building on a bright sunny day.
 I'm really sorry that I didn't get a picture of the turkey before I carved it. So the carved picture is what you get for now. I'm making this for the Fourth of July so I hope to get the picture of the whole  turkey  then.
