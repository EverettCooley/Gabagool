        To Make Crispy  rice 
 
  Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours
 
 Yield: 8 - 10 squares
 Rinse 1 cup of long or medium  grain   rice . In a pot, add 1 1/2 cups  water  (1 1/4 cups for medium  grain   rice ) to the  rice  and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Remove from burner and allow to cool.
 While  rice  is cooling, preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the  rice  on a baking sheet, making sure that it is about, but no more than, 1/4-inch thick.
 Bake the  rice  for 50 â€“ 55 minutes, until it is dry. Cool and cut into 2-inch squares. Store in a canister until needed. Do not freeze.
