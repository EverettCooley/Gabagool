 Combine hot  applesauce  and  baking soda  ( don"t try to be modern and use cold  applesauce  and mix with  baking soda  with the  flour ; it doesn't work as well that way), and add, along with  oil ,  walnuts  and  raisins , to  flour  mixture. 
 Mix at medium speed until  flour  is moistened and batter in creamy. 
 Spread batter evenly in a 9" by 13" cake pan that has been sprayed with pan spray or greased well with  margarine . 
 Bake at 375 °F for 20 to 25 minutes, or till bars pull away from the sides of the pan and a cake tester comes out clean from the center. 
 Cool on a wire rack. 
 Cut three by six.
