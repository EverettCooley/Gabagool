 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 couscous 
 
 3 cups of  couscous  (quick cooking) 
 3 cups of warm salted  water  (1/2 to 1 teaspoon of  salt ) 
 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 Oven 400F 
 Salad
 
 2-3 large  tomatoes , chopped 
 1-2 medium  zucchini , halved and sliced thinly 
 ½-1 cup fresh  basil , cut into strips (I use kitchen shears) 
 ½ cup  green onions , sliced 
 1 cup  feta   Cheese , crumbled 
 2 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Prepare the  couscous : 
 In a large oven dish, with a great surface area, such as a 9" x 13" baking dish (or larger), place the  couscous  so that the  grains  are not squashed on top of each other. Gradually add the same volume of  water , stirring constantly so that the  water  is absorbed evenly. 
 Keep fluffing up the  grain  with a fork and breaking up any lumps. After about 15 minutes of this, when the  grain  is plump and tender, mix in 3 Tb of  vegetable oil  and rub the  grains  between your hands above the bowl to air it and break up any lumps. 
 Put the dish uncovered, into a pre-heated 400F over and heat thru for about 10 minutes, then fluff again, and then heat again until heated through, about 10 more minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. 
 Combine cooled  couscous ,  lemon juice  and  olive oil . Add  tomatoes ,  zucchini ,  basil  and  green onions . 
 Chill 4 hours or overnight. Add  feta   Cheese  right before serving
