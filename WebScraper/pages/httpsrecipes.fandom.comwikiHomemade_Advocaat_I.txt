Boy, is  advocaat  delicious! (I usually get a bottle of it from the Dutch-America store and skip the above...:) this delicious Dutch drink is actually eaten with a spoon! one more from from Holland with love ... the Dutch national drink!!
 
 Ingredients : 
 10  eggs 
 ½ level teaspoon  salt 
 275 grams  sugar 
 4 dl  cognac 
 1½ level teaspoons  vanilla essence  (extract, i think) 
 Directions : 
 Separate the  eggs  and beat the  yolks  with the  salt  and the  sugar , until the mixture is thick and creamy. 
 Beat in the  cognac , very slowly and put the mixture into a double saucepan. 
 Heat gently, whisking all the time until the  advocaat  is warm (not hot) and thick. 
 Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the  vanilla essence . 
 Pour into a jug. 
 advocaat  is served in a glass and eaten with a teaspoon. 
 It can also be topped with  whipped cream . 
 Also, might i add, that  advocaat  is nothing like the eggnog here in America. 
 It is thick and creamy — not foamy at all.
