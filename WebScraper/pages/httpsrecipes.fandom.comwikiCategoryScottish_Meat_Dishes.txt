 Meat was and still is one of the main elements of any Scottish meal. Meat was always a more consistent source of food than vegetables. Fish represent a large percentage of the meat found in Scottish dishes. Both saltwater fish like the herring and inland water fish like trout or salmon are prepared in hundreds of ways and recipes. However, veal and lamb are often used, together with pork meat. When compared to other European countries, Scottish dishes seem to favor less pork meat and rely more on mutton and lamb. Lamb is roasted or used in stews, curries, casseroles or mutton pies. Mince and tatties is a Scottish dish of ground beef with gravy, onions and potatoes. In the north and west, some people eat game, such as grouse, pheasant, venison, woodcock or hare.
