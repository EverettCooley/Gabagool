 Serves 4 to 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds  chicken wings  (about 10) 
 2  garlic  cloves, minced and mashed to a paste with 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 1 teaspoon dried hot  red pepper flakes 
 ⅓ cup light  corn syrup 
 ½ cup distilled  white vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Cut off the wings tips, reserving them for another use such as stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joint. 
 In a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag toss the wings with the  garlic  paste and the  oil  to coat them well and let them marinate, chilled, for at least 6 Hours or overnight. 
 Drain the wings and pat them dry. 
 Arrange the wings, skin side up, on the oiled rack of a broiler pan, sprinkle them with  salt  and  pepper  to taste, and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown. 
 Turn the wings, sprinkle them with  salt  and  pepper  to taste, and broil them for 5 to 8 minutes more, or until they are golden. 
 While the wings are broiling, in a saucepan stir together the  red pepper flakes , the  corn syrup , and the  vinegar 
 Bring the liquid to a boil, stirring, and transfer it to a bowl. 
 Serve the wings with the sauce.
