Ingredients
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 1 pound) 
1 2-1/2-ounce jar sliced mushrooms, drained 
1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs 
1/2 teaspoon dried sage, crushed 
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram, crushed 
 
  Dash garlic salt 
 Dash black pepper 
 
 2 tablespoons chicken broth 
1/2 cup chicken broth 
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
1 tablespoon dry white wine 
 Directions
1. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place each chicken breast half between 2
sheets of plastic wrap. Working from center to the edges, pound
lightly with the flat side of a meat mallet to 1/8-inch thickness. Set
aside. 
 2. In a small mixing bowl stir together mushrooms, bread crumbs, sage,
marjoram, garlic salt, black pepper, and 2 tablespoons chicken broth.
Spoon one-fourth of the mixture onto the short end of each chicken
breast. Fold in long sides of chicken and roll up into a spiral,
starting from the short edge. Secure with wooden toothpicks. Place in
a 4- or 6-quart pressure cooker and add 1/2 cup chicken broth or stock. 
 3. Lock lid in place. Place pressure regulator on vent pipe (if you
have a first-generation cooker). Over high heat, bring cooker up to
pressure. Reduce heat just enough to maintain pressure and pressure
regulator rocks gently; cook for 5 minutes. 
 4. Quick-release the pressure. Carefully remove lid. Remove chicken to
a serving platter; keep warm. 
 5. For sauce, strain liquid in cooker through a sieve; return liquid
to cooker. In a small bowl stir together cornstarch and wine. Add to
liquid in cooker. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and
stir for 2 minutes more. Serve sauce over chicken. Makes 4 main-dish
serving. 
 Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare chicken rolls. Cover and chill up to 24 hours.
Cook and serve as above.
