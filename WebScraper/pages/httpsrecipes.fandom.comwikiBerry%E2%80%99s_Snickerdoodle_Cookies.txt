 Ingredients : 
 Potassium bitartrate 
 Sugar 
 Butter 
 Ground cinnamon 
 Cinnamon 
 Flour 
 Baking powder 
 Eggs 
 Brown sugar 
 Unsalted butter 
 Instructions : 
 Start by creaming butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes. This is an important step as the butter coats the sugar crystals and creates a smooth texture. It also whips air into the cookie dough. 
 Use Cream of Tartar as a leavening agent. It gives it the signature tangy flavor and chewy texture.  A touch of baking soda helps the cookies to rise as well. 
 Double roll the cookie balls into a cinnamon-sugar mixture.  This helps to make sure the cookies are completely coated in cinnamon-sugar before baking. 
 Bake just until the edges begin to become a light golden color.  These snickerdoodle cookies need to be soft and chewy so watch carefully. If you want them to be flat, press the balls down in the center before placing in the oven. Voila. Let’s eat.
