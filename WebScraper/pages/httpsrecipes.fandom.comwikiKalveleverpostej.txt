Description : 
       Kalveleverpostej     
 Calves' liver paste
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds  pork fat 
 10 tablespoons  butter 
 10 tablespoons  flour 
 milk 
 1 calves'  liver 
 2  egg yolks 
 salt  and  pepper 
 ground  cloves 
 2  egg whites 
 1 teaspoon  onion  (optional) — grated 
 Directions : 
 Put the fat through a food grinder or into an electric blender. 
 Turn into a large, heavy skillet. 
 Add the  butter  and the  flour  with enough  milk  to make a mixture of thick porridge-like consistency. 
 Let cook until the fat has absorbed. 
 Cook very slowly. 
 Skim off any fat which does not absorb. 
 Wash and clean the liver thoroughly. 
 Cut it in manageable pieces and feed through the finest blade of your meat grinder. 
 Mix with the fat mixtures and put through a coarse sieve to make a smooth paste. 
 Add the  egg yolks , slat,  pepper  and a good pinch of the ground cloves. 
 Beat the  egg  whites until stiff and add. 
 If you wish, add a little grated  onion  to the blend. 
 Fill bread tins about ¾ full of mixture. 
 Bake in a pan of hot  water  1¼ hours, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean (preheat oven to 325°F) 
 Do not remove any fat that may come to the surface; it will be absorbed. 
 Let cool in the pans and dip in boiling  water  to loosen after it has chilled overnight. 
 Slice thin, serve on dark bread, imaginatively garnished.
