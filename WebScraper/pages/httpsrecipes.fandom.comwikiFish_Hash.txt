Fish Hash
 You may use a vegetable oil in place of salt pork, but the flavor will not
be quite the same. Serve with thick slices of fresh tomatoes.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/4 lb salt pork or bacon, diced small 
 1 onion, chopped 
 1-1/2 C diced boiled potatoes 
 1-1/2 C flaked or chopped cooked fish 
 Salt 
 Freshly ground pepper 
 Directions : 
 In a hot skillet, cook the salt pork until the fat is rendered and the bits 
 of pork are brown and crisp. Remove, drain on paper towels, and set aside.
 
 Toss together the onion, potatoes, fish, and salt and pepper to taste---take 
 care not to over salt: the salt pork may supply enough. Stir into the fat in
the skillet and cook over medium heat. Press down with a spatula and cook
over 5 minutes, until the bottom is brown. Turn the hash over and cook until
the underside is nicely browned. Tip out onto a warm platter and sprinkle
with the crisp bits of salt pork.
