 Description : 
       Indonesian Liver     
 If you read this recipe and think that it is hot you might like to know that the original recipe uses 14 small  red peppers ! Add more if you like. I only taste the sauce of this, because I don't like liver, and think it is hot enough. If you cannot get the  lime  leaves the only substitute I know of is  lime  zest. The flavors do improve if you make it in advance and then reheat.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¼ – 1½ lbs  liver ,  beef , pork   or   chicken's 
 1½ – 2 cups  coconut milk 
 2  kaffir lime leaf 
 1 stalk  lemongrass , the fleshy part bruised 
 For the spice paste : 
 8  shallots , peeled, chopped 
 3 cloves  garlic , peeled chopped 
 4  red chile peppers , chopped (I remove the seeds) 
 1 slice peeled chopped fresh  galangal  (¾ inch approx)  or  1 teaspoon ground  galangal 
 1 slice peeled chopped  fresh turmeric  (¾ inch approx)  or  ½ teaspoon  powdered turmeric 
 1 slice peeled chopped  fresh ginger 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2 tablespoons  peanut oil , for frying 
 Directions : 
 Clean the liver and chop into chunks of approx 1 inch. 
 Make the paste; put all the ingredients except for the  oil  in a blender or food processor and pulse to a paste. 
 Heat the  oil  in a large frying pan, add the paste and fry the paste together with the  lime  leaves and the  lemon grass  for 2 to 3 minutes add the liver and fry for another 2 minutes. 
 Then add the  coconut milk , start with 1 ½ cup you can always add more to taste, simmer without covering for about 15 minutes, the sauce should be thick and the liver cooked, watch that you don’t over cook the liver taste for  salt  and serve this with  rice  as a main dish or part of an Indonesian  Rijsttafel .
