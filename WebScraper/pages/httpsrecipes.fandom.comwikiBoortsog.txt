 Ingredients : 
 Premium  wheat flour  – 1 kg 
 A pinch of  salt 
 Sugar  – 150 g 
 butter  – 100 g 
 Warm boiled  water 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve  salt ,  Sugar  and  butter  in warm boiled  water  and blend until the  Sugar  and  butter  are completely dissolved and a smooth homogenous mixture is formed. Then, mix in  flour  and knead into smooth soft dough. The kneading process is very important for boortsog and may require sufficient strength and energy. The dough must be kneaded until such a state when no air remains in it. When the dough is cut, the profile must be absolutely smooth and homogenous with no hole or air bubble whatsoever. Reaching such a state will require a series of kneading and leaving the dough to rest. When the dough is ready, roll out until it is about 1-1.5 sm thick. Now, you can use your imagination to cut the dough into different shapes. However, the classic shaping is to cut the dough into stripes of 3-4 sm wide and cut out squares, triangles or any other shapes using a sharp knife. Using the knife, make two little cut-like lines on each piece. This is done in order to let the air out, if any left, as well as to give some decoration to boortsog. Some people cut the dough into rectangles that are 3 sm wide and about 10 sm long, make a long cut in the middle, pull simultaneously the two edges through the cut and twist to the opposite sides.
 Preheat  oil , put boortsog in bunches and fry until golden brown. Pull out with the strainer and put on the rack to cool down.
