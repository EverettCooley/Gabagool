Ingredients : 
 4  plantains  [should be firm] 
 4 tsp  lemon juice 
 4 tsp  ground ginger 
 4 tsp  cayenne pepper 
 oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 Slice the  plantains  into rounds ½-inch thick, and sprinkle  lemon juice  over the pieces, stirring to moisten. 
 In a separate bowl, combine the  ginger  and  pepper . 
 Heat about ¼ inch of  oil  in a heavy skillet until a test piece of  plantain  sputters. 
 Roll  plantain  pieces a few at a time in the spice mixture to coat surfaces, then transfer to the skillet. 
 Fry until outsides are crisp and golden. 
 With a slotted spoon, remove plaintains to an absorbent cloth [or paper toweling] for cooling [slightly]. 
 Serve hot.
