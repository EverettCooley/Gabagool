Description : 
 My Mom would often make Jiffy  corn muffins  on weekend mornings. While I was musing about this, I realized that there was a box of Jiffy cornbread in the cupboard and found this pancake recipe on the box. It was originally intended to be cooked on a griddle using melted  Crisco , but I substituted melted butter and a frying pan since it's what I had on hand.
 
 Cook Time : 20 minutes 
 Serves : 2-3 
 Ingredients : 
 1 box Jiffy (or similar) corn muffin mix 
 1  egg 
 2 tablespoons melted  butter  or shortening 
 Â¾ cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Mix ingredients together in a bowl. 
 Don't worry if batter is slightly lumpy: it's supposed to be that way. 
 Cook on hot skillet which is greased with oil or butter. 
 Flip pancakes when butter/oil bubbles appear around pancakes and edges begin to dry.
