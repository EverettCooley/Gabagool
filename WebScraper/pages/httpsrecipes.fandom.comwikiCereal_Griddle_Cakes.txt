 Description : 
 From my Grandmother’s Estate. Notation on card says this was one of several griddlecake recipes served at church breakfast fundraisers for years. Dated 1928.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1-1/2 cups  flour 
 ½ cup cooked cereal 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 3-1/2 teaspoons  baking powder 
 1-1/2 cups  milk 
 1 beaten  egg 
 2 tablespoons melted  shortening 
 2  egg  whites, stiffly beaten 
 1-teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix and then sift all of the dry ingredients. 
 Add the well-beaten  egg  to the liquid. 
 Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients very gradually and stir quickly. 
 Add the melted  shortening ,  egg  whites and  vanilla extract . 
 Place on griddle and cook about 2 minutes on each side. 
 Don’t turn more than once, it makes them tough.
