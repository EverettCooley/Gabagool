 Here"s a method for de-gassing dried beans that seems to work. It"s from the new book fat free, flavor full by dr. Gabe mirkin and diana rich. "put the beans in a large pot and cover them with  water . Bring them to a boil and take them off the heat. This breaks the capsules surrounding the beans and allows stachyose, verbascose and raffinose, the gas-causing sugars, to escape into the  water . Stir a couple of tablespoons of  baking soda  into the  water  and let the beans soak overnight. Drain the soaking  water  off the beans and rinse them several times. (if you eat the soaking liquid, you will cause unbelievable discomfort for yourself and those around you)." then you cook "em and eat "em. End of story, so to speak. I"ve used this method with  pinto beans , but rarely soak them for more than 4 hours (because when i"m hungry for beans i want them today, not tomorrow). I"ve found it better than beano, but of course your mileage may vary.
