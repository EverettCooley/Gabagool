 Wikipedia Article  About Baker's yeast on Wikipedia 
 Bakers' yeast is a type of yeast used in baking and is known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This species is also used in fermentation of beer and wine. Yeasts for leavening bread may be produced industrially or commercially or caught from the environment. Commercial yeast is prepared by taking one yeast cell, placing it in a test tube, and providing it with food and the moist, warm conditions it needs to thrive. Yeast undergo asexual reproduction, so it can reproduce itself rapidly, creating large numbers of cells.
 This yeast is used as a leaven in breads, coffeecakes, and pastries like croissants and brioche. It works by converting sugar into carbon dioxide, which causes the dough to rise so the bread will be light and airy. Yeast comes either as dry granules or moist cakes. It becomes less potent after the expiration date stamped on the package, so dough made with it may take longer to rise, or not rise at all. If the potency of the yeast is in doubt, test or "proof" it by putting some of it in warm water (105° - 115 °F) mixed with a bit of sugar. If it doesn't get foamy within ten minutes, you'll need to get fresher yeast. 
 Equivalents : 1 tablespoon = 1 package = 1 cake
