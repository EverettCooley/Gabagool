 Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for 2 hrs in fridge. 
 Cook on stove top at I believe Med-Med/High? (Can't remember 100%, but if you can cook, you should be able to figure this out quickly on how the  Chicken  is doing) 
 Season with  pepper  to taste.

 I actually followed this recipe with only 3  Chicken  breast pieces and like the extra seasonings on it.
