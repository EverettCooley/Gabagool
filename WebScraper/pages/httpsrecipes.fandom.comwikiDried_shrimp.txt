      Shrimp - Dried     About dried shrimp : 
 Small, orangish-pink, dried shellfish used in Asia and Latin America as a flavoring in many dishes. Dried shrimp, which have a strong fishy taste, are used whole, chopped, or ground as an addition to soups, stuffings, stir-fries, noodle dishes and salads. For most dishes, the shrimp need to be reconstituted in warm water before being used. This water in which they're soaked is sometimes added to the dish for flavor. Dried shrimp can be found in small cellophane bags in Asian markets.
