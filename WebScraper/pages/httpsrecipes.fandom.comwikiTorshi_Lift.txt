      Torshi Lift     
 Description : 
 A delight to serve with grilled and roasted meats. Be patient and resist the temptation to open the jar before they are ready! Once opened they will keep for 4 – 6 weeks in a cool place, if they last that long!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¼ lbs small  turnips 
 9 ounces raw  beetroots , preferably not much larger than the  turnips 
 4 ounces fresh  dates , stoned and halved (optional) 
 4 cloves  garlic , cloves skinned and very finely chopped 
 4½ tablespoons  salt 
 3¾ cups  water 
 1½ cups  white vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  turnips  and cut in half. 
 Peel the beetroot and slice thinly. 
 Pack the  turnips  into sterilised jars alternating with layers of the beetroot,  garlic  and  dates . 
 Bring the  water  and the  salt  to boil and then add the  vinegar . 
 Pour over the vegetables making sure they are completely covered by the liquid. If there is not quite enough liquid add a little more  vinegar  and brine. 
 Seal the jars and leave in the kitchen. 
 Ready to eat in 10 – 12 days.
