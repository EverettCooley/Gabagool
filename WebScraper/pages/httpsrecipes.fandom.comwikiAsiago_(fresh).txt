 Wikipedia Article  About Asiago (fresh) on Wikipedia 
 Fresh asiago is a semifirm cheese with a rich, nutty flavor.
 It was originally made only in the Dolomite Mountains region of northern Italy, near the town of Asiago. It can be used for grating and as a table cheese. This cheese is granular, like Parmesan, but a bit more pungent in flavor. An American-made asiago is also available.
