 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds frozen or dried Melokiyah 
 1  Onion , cut in half 
 1  bay leaf 
 4-5  cardamom   grains 
 5 pound  Chicken  ( or 2 smaller chickens) 
 15-20  garlic  cloves, crushed 
 1 Tb coriander powder 
 1 Tb  lemon juice 
 cooking  oil 
 salt 
 cooked  rice 
 Directions : 
 Boil  water  with  Onion ,  salt ,  bay leaf  and  cardamom  tied in a muslin bag, then add the  Chicken  and cook until tender. Remove  Chicken , cut into neat joints and fry. 
 Discard the muslin bag and mash the  Onion . Boil the soup stock, add the melokiyah, adjust the seasoning and simmer for 3–5 minutes. Do not overcook, as the melokiyah will lose its ability to be suspended in the broth and fall to the bottom of the pot. 
 Mix crushed  garlic  with  salt  and coriander (ta’liya) and fry until golden. Toss into the boiling melokiyah and simmer for 2 minutes. Add  lemon juice . 
 Place the cooked  rice  at the bottom of the serving bowl, add a piece of  Chicken  and cover with the soup.
