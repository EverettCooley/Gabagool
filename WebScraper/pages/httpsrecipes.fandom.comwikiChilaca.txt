 About chilaca peppers : 
 Chilaca peppers are quite similar to  poblano peppers  for which they are often mistaken. The fresh narrow chilaca can measure up to 9 inches (22 cm) long and often has a twisted shape, which is seldom apparent after drying. It turns from dark green to dark brown or black when fully mature.
 In its dried form, it is known as a  pasilla pepper .
