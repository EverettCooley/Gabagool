 Stumped for Ideas? : 
 Think of what your family usually eats during the holidays. Creativity and uniqueness are encouraged here, so don't worry about whether or not you'd find the recipe in a traditional cookbook. 
 Still stumped? Here are some ideas for holiday recipes that could be added to Foodie.
