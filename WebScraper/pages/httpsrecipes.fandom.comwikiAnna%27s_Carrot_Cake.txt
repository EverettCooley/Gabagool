 4 cups. cake flour
4 cups. superfine sugar
4 tsp. baking soda
2 tsp. salt
3 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. nutmeg
1/4 tsp. cloves
8 eggs
2 cups. vegetable oil

1 1/2 cups. chopped English walnuts

 In a large bowl beat eggs until foamy and very light. Slowly pour in oil, beating on lowest speed of mixer.
 Gradually add flour mixture to egg/oil mixture beating on lowest mixer speed until smooth. Fold in carrots and nuts. Pour into greased and floured 11x15
inch cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, then test for doneness. Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from pan.
 WHITE CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE BUTTERCREAM:
 9 oz. white chocolate
12 oz. cream cheese
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
1 1/2 tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice
 Have all ingredients at room temperature.
 Melt the white chocolate very carefully, either over hot water in a double boiler stirring continuously as the chocolate melts, or in the microwave stirring
every 15 seconds. Set the chocolate aside to cool.
 In a mixing bowl beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually beat in the cooled chocolate until completely incorporated in the cream cheese.
Beat in the butter and the lemon juice until light and fluffy.
 NOTE: If using a double boiler to melt the chocolate, do not cover it. If the condensate falls back into the chocolate, it will ruin it.
