A sandwich is two slices of bread (or more), with many other foods added. Such as tomatoes, pickles, and cheese. They became popular after the British Earl Sandwich started eating meat sandwiches during poker games so as not to get his cards greasy. Though it is more than likely they were consumed before the Earl popularized them amongst other British nobles and in turn the nobles workers. The original sandwich gave way to well known foods such as Burgers and Victoria Sponges.
