       Baked Artichoke Dip     
 Ingredients : 
 1 can  artichoke hearts , drained 
 1 small  onion 
 2 cloves  garlic 
 ¼ cup  mayonnaise 
 ¼ cup sour  cream 
 ¼ cup  Parmesan cheese 
 1 (8 ounces) package  mozzarella  cheese, divided 
 ½ teaspoon  oregano 
 ¼ teaspoon dried  basil   or  6 leaves fresh  basil , approximately 
 salt  and  pepper 
 chopped  parsley  (to garnish) (optional) 
 1 loaf crusty  French bread 
 Directions : 
 Process artichokes,  onion  and  garlic  in the food processor until smooth (or if you like, until blended, but still have texture). 
 In medium sized bowl (or if you're a little lazy like me, right in the medium sized ceramic baking dish), combine remaining ingredients except  parsley  and  bread , reserving 1 cup of  mozzarella . 
 Sprinkle remaining  cheese  over  artichoke  dip, and sprinkle with chopped  parsley . 
 Bake at 400ºF for 20 minutes, or until bubbly and beginning to brown. 
 Serve with crusty  French bread  slices.
