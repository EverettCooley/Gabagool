       New Zealand Lamb     
 Ingredients : 
 1 x Boneless leg of  Lamb 
 1/2 cup  lemon juice 
 1/2 cup  oil 
 1/2 cup  white wine 
 1 tsp Crushed  garlic 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 tsp Dried  rosemary 
 1 tsp  pepper 
 1 tbl  red pepper flakes 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Marinate in the fridge for a good long while. A week isn't too long. Grill in a Webber kettle with the lid on and the vents almost closed, 15â€“20 minutes on each side.
A leg of  Lamb  is great for a crowd. Because the thickness is quite uneven, some parts will be well done while others are medium rare. Who says you can't please all the people all the time!
