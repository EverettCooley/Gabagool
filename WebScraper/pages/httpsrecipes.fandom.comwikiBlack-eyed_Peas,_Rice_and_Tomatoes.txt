 Ingredients : 
 1  onion 
 water /broth for saute 
 1 15 oz can peeled  tomatoes  drained or equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes (~1.5 cups) 
 1 15 oz can  Black-Eyed Peas  drained 
 2 cup cooked  white rice 
 salt ,  pepper ,  garlic powder  for seasoning 
 Directions : 
 Chop the  onion  and saute it in a good size frying pan with the broth. If you are using fresh  tomatoes , add them and cook until they are soft. Stir in the remaining ingredients and heat through. Makes about 3-4 servings, as a main course casserole notes: don"t drain the  tomatoes  and black-eyes completely. You need a little "juice" to make it a nice mushy (comforting) casserole. I really liked it with a generous amount of  pepper . This recipe was from a TV program here in raleigh nc called "southern sportsman". I just took out the  oil  and  Bacon . I thought it was pretty funny to find a healthy recipe (with modifications) off a TV show that talks about hunting and shooting and fishing (and eating..frying...the "catch"...yuk). Guess this recipe is for the days when the rabbits,  Deer , ducks, and  Trout  are smarter!!
