Description : 
 Pickled fish. Slaves from Dutch territories in the East Indies brought their culinary traditions with them to southern Africa. Although pickled fish no longer play as important a nutritional role as they did in the days before refrigeration, they are still popular.  Snoek  and  Hake  are commonly used, but any firm, fleshy fish will pickle well. Because they are eaten cold, they make excellent hot weather fare. This recipe serves 4 as a first course or when accompanied by filling side dishes such as  potato salad . You must make it 2 days before you plan to eat it.
