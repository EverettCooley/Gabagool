 About Lobster : 
 This king of the crustacean family has a jointed body and limbs covered with a hard shell.
 Lobster recipes include Lobster Newberg and  Lobster Thermidor . Lobster is used variously, for example in soup, bisque, lobster rolls, and cappon magro. Lobster meat may be dipped in clarified butter, resulting in a sweetened flavour.
 Cooks boil live lobsters in water or steam. The lobster simmers for seven minutes for the first pound and three minutes for each additional pound.
 Lobsters are also fried, grilled, or baked.
 A popular shellfish valued for its rich juicy meat. The European and American lobster are the most popular of the lobster family. The American lobster, the larger of the two, is found in the western North Atlantic and is reddish brown in color with some brown spots. The European lobster is found in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, and is black in color with some pale yellow blotches. Lobster is best purchased live but can also be bought already cooked, cleaned and shelled. It is the lobster tail and the lobster claws that contain the majority of the meat in a lobster. The tail provides one large piece of meat while the claws have small narrow strips of meat.
