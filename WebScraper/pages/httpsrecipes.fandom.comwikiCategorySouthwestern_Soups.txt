 The soups of the Southwestern cuisine are by definition very hot and spicy. Southwestern soups are definitely made to warm up the coldest winter night. Nothing can compare to a hot bowl of Southwestern soup. The ingredients used in cooking such spicy soups vary a lot, but you can be sure that chili is always on the list.
