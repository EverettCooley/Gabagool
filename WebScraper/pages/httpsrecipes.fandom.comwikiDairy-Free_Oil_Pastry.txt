 Ingredients : 
 1 1/4 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup whole- Wheat   pastry flour 
 2 Tbs.  Sugar 
 1/2 (scant) tsp.  salt 
 5 Tbs. mild-flavored  olive oil  or  canola oil 
 5 Tbs. ice-cold  water 
 Directions : 
 In food processor, combine both flours,  Sugar  and  salt  and pulse to mix. With machine running, add  oil  in thin, steady stream, about 5 seconds. Remove lid and fluff mixture with fork. Replace lid and pulse again 1 to 2 seconds.
 
 Put  ice   water  in measuring cup. With machine running, add 3 tablespoons  water  in 3-second stream. Stop machine at once, remove lid and fluff again with fork. Replace lid and add remaining 2 tablespoons  water  with 2-second pulse; pastry will form large crumbs.
 
 Turn pastry out onto work surface, scraping bowl thoroughly with rubber spatula. Gently knead 2 or 3 times into ball. Place dough on large sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 3/4-inch-thick disk; smooth cracked edges. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 to 60
 
 minutes before rolling. Unlike like a  butter  pastry, dough wonâ€™t become very firm; this is primarily a rest to ensure easy rolling.
