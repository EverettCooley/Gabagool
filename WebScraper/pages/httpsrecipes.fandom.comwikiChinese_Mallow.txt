 About Chinese Mallow : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Malva on Wikipedia 
 Malva is a genus of about 25 species of herbaceous plants in the family Malvaceae (named after it), one of several closely related genera in the family to bear the common English name mallow. The genus is widespread throughout the temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Europe.
 The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed; the flowers are from 0.5-5 cm diameter, with five pink or white petals.
 Several species are widely grown as garden flowers, while some are invasive weeds, particularly in the Americas where they are not native.
 Many species are edible as leaf vegetables. M. verticillata (Chinese: 冬寒菜; Hanyu Pinyin: dōngháncài) is grown on a limited commercial scale in China.
