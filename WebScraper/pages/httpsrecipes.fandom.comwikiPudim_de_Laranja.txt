 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can  sweetened condensed milk 
 Equal volume of freshly-squeezed  orange juice 
 3  eggs 
 1 tsp  orange  zest 
 1 cup  Sugar  (for the caramel) 
 1 8-inch ring mold 
 Directions : 
 Place 1 to 2 inches of  water  in a roasting pan. 
 Place the pan in the oven and preheat to 325Â°. 
 Put the  Sugar  in the ring mold. 
 Place the mold directly over medium heat. 
 Keep turning the mold until the  Sugar  melts into a golden brown caramel and spoon it up the sides of the mold. 
 Be careful not to burn the  Sugar  and yourself. 
 Let the mold cool. 
 Combine the  condensed milk ,  orange juice ,  orange  zest and  eggs  in a blender. 
 Whip (I like to use the frappe button in my blender) until smooth. 
 Pour this mixture into the mold and place it in the center of the roasting pan with  water . 
 Bake the pudim for about one hour (it will depend on your oven). 
 It will turn golden brown on top and start separating from the sides of the mold. 
 Let it cool to room temperature and place in refrigerator, preferably overnight (at least 6 hours).
