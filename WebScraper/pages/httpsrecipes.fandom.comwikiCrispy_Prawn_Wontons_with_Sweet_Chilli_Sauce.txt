Description : 
 For 4 people
 
 Ingredients : 
 Chilli sauce : 
 2 cups  rice wine vinegar 
 1½ cups white  sugar 
 5 tablespoons  fish sauce 
 2 large  red chillies , finely sliced on the diagonal 
 Wontons : 
 9 uncooked medium-sized  prawns  (shrimp) – about 300 g (10 oz) 
 1 tablespoon roughly chopped coriander ( cilantro ) leaves 
 1 tablespoon finely sliced spring onions ( scallions ) 
 1½ teaspoons finely diced  ginger 
 1 teaspoon  shao hsing wine  or dry  sherry 
 1 teaspoon  light soy sauce 
 1 teaspoon  oyster sauce 
 ¼ teaspoon white  sugar 
 ¼ teaspoon  sesame oil 
 16 fresh  wonton wrappers , about 7 cm (3 in) square 
 Directions : 
 Place vinegar and sugar in a medium-sized heavy-based saucepan and bring to the oil. 
 Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes or until liquid is reduced by almost half and slightly syrupy. 
 Remove from stove, stir in fish sauce and chillies and set aside. 
 For the wontons, peel and de-vein prawns, then dice prawn meat– you should have about 150 g (5 oz) diced prawn meat. 
 Combine prawn meat and remaining ingredients, except wonton wrappers, in a bowl, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
 Next fill and shape the wontons. 
 Heat oil in a hot wok until surface seems to shimmer slightly. 
 Add wontons in batches and deep-fry for about 2 minutes or until just cooked through and lightly browned. 
 To test the wontons you will need to remove one using a slotted spoon and cut it through with a sharp knife to see if the prawns are just cooked through. 
 Remove wontons with a slotted spoon and drain well on kitchen paper. 
 Repeat process with remaining wontons. 
 Arrange wontons on a platter and serve immediately with a bowl of sweet chilli dipping sauce.
