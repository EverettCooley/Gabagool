 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup each  sugar  and  shortening 
 2 tsp  salt 
 1 pkg.  yeast  (mom always used Red Star® - regular, not quick) 
 6 cups  flour , plus (mom always used Robin Hood®) 
 2  eggs 
 2 tsp  vanilla 
 2 cups  milk   or  1 cup warm  water  with 3 tsp dry  milk  powder, and 1 cup  milk 
 1 cup  golden raisins  ( sultanas ) 
 Directions : 
 Place dry ingredients in bowl. 
 Warm  milk  (or  milk  and  water ), add  eggs  and  vanilla . 
 Add  milk  mixture to dry ingredients and work together about 4 minutes. 
 Cover and rest dough 10 minutes. 
 Add  raisins  and knead for 8–10 minutes or until hands remain clean from dough. 
 Add  flour  as necessary, but do not make the dough very stiff, the softer, the better. 
 Raise until double, punch down, shape and raise again. Bake at 400 °F for 40–50 minutes. 
 To shape in traditional manner, divide dough in half. 
 Place each in a 3 lbs (or as close as possible to that size) clean  coffee  can, reserving a little dough from each to make a cross-shaped braid on top. 
 Raise until double. 
 Before baking, brush with beaten  egg  over top generously.
