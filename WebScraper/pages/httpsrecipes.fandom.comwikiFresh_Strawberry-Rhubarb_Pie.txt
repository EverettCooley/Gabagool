 1 pt  strawberries 
 1¼ cups  sugar 
 3 tbsp  tapioca ; quick-cooking 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 3 tbsp  margarine 
 1 pie dough, enough for 9" pie 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wash  rhubarb , cut away any tough parts and chop into small pieces. 
 Slice the  strawberries  and add to  rhubarb . 
 Mix the remaining ingredients and add to fruit. 
 Blend well and allow to stand for up to 30 minutes to allow  sugar  to penetrate  strawberries . 
 Pour mixture into 9-inch pie crust, dot with  margarine  and cover with second crust. 
 Cut slits in top crust. 
 Bake in preheated 375 °F oven for 50–55 minutes. 
 Cover pie with aluminum foil tented over it during first 30 minutes, removing to allow crust to brown during the last part of baking. 
 About 10 minutes before done, brush on warm  milk  and sprinkle top crust lightly with  sugar  if desired.
