 About Danbo : 
 A Swiss-style cheese from Denmark with a red or yellow wax rind and pale yellow interior dotted with holes. Danbo has a firm texture and mildly sweet, nutlike flavor. Regular Danbo has about 45 percent milk fat; the lowfat variety contains only 20 percent fat.
 Danbo is a semi-soft, aged cow's milk cheese  originating in Denmark, where it is a common household cheese.
 The cheese is typically aged between 12 and 52 weeks in rectangular blocks of 6 or 9 kg, coated with a bacteria culture. The culture is washed off at the end of the aging cycle, and the cheese is packaged for retail sales.
 Danbo is sold under various trade and brand names, including Lillebror, Gamle-Ole, and Riberhus by Arla Foods.
 In the first decades of the 20th century, Danish immigrants, established in the south part of Minas Gerais State in Brazil, discovered a new kind of cheese, after making the traditional Danbo Cheese with Brazilian milk. This cheese is called Queijo prato.
