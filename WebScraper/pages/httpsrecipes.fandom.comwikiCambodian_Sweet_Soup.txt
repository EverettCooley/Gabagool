 pepper ,  salt 
 1-1.5 cups  Sugar

 Add  Sugar  until sweet (the soup, not you!) 
 Add enough sauce to taste (usu about 1.4 cup) 
 Add about 5-7 tbit/s of soy sauce 
 At this point you should be smelling a very beautiful smell. The soup should taste sweet, but not so sweet you can't taste the tinge of sauce you added. 
 Add the boiled  eggs  to the soup, let boil for about 15 minutes then add the cubed  Pork . 
 Add Bamboo slices to soup and let boil on medium for about 30 minutes. 
 You should notice that the  eggs  are taking up a shiny delicatable brown color. 
 The soup should smell slightly different. When  eggs  are a nice brown color, the soup is ready to serve.
