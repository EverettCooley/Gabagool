 Description : 
 Guacamole is best made as close to serving as possible. For short-term storage, seal in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  California avocados , about 1 pound 
 ½ cup roasted  corn   [1] 
 ½  lemon , sliced thinly (with peel on), then cut in small dice 
 2 large cloves  garlic , chopped finely 
 1 medium (or to taste)  jalapeno pepper , chopped finely 
 ½ tsp (or to taste) ground  cumin 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely mash (DO NOT PUREE) avocados. 
 Fold in remaining ingredients. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   To roast  corn , soak 1 ear in  water  for 1 hour. Remove husk and silk. Roast on the rack in a 375 °F degree oven, turning occasionally, until kernels appear slightly shriveled. Substitute well drained canned  corn  that has been blotted with a towel, if necessary.
