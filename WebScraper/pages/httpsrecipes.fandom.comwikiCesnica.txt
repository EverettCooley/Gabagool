 1 kg  flour 
 20 gr  yeast 
 1 cup  olive oil 
 salt

 Directions : 
 Sift 1 kg of  flour  in a dish. Add 20 gr of  yeast , one cup of  oil , a bit of  salt  and knead it with warm  water  until the dough starts to separate from your hands. Dough should not be too soft, or too hard. 
 Spread  oil  on baking pan and place the dough on it and leave it 10 minutes in a warm place. 
 Perforate the dough with a fork to avoid having empty spaces under the crust. 
 Christmas bread is usually decorated with bits of dough shaped like birds or braids. 
 Put the baking pan in the oven heated well. 
 When the crust is baked, cover it with a sheet of paper that will permit the bread to bake well.
