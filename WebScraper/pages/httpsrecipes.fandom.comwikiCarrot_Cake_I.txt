 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C, gas mark 6).

 Dust with flour and tap out excess. 
 In a large bowl, whisk together the egg whites, yogurt, oil, applesauce, brown sugar, and vanilla. 
 On a piece of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt (if using), cinnamon, and nutmeg. 
 Gradually add to egg-applesauce mixture, stirring until incorporated. 
 Stir in the carrots. 
 Drain and reserve the juice from the pineapple.

 Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon. 
 Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. 
 Cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. 
 Slide a thin knife around the edges and center of the cake to loosen it from the pan. 
 Invert onto a rack to cool. 
 When ready to serve, transfer cake to a serving platter.
