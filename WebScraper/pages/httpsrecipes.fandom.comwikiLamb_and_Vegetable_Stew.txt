Description : 
       Lamb and Vegetable Stew     
 Chockful of tender  Lamb , this hearty stew is a delicious departure from the standard  Beef  version.  Lamb  stew meat is tasty, inexpensive and underused—at least on this side of the Atlantic. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup Atkins Quick Quisine™  bake mix 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 2 pounds  lamb   stew meat 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2  garlic  cloves, passed through a press 
 1 teaspoon dried  oregano 
 1 (14½-ounce) can diced  tomatoes 
 ½ cup  water 
 1 tablespoon  red wine vinegar 
 1 packet  sugar substitute 
 2 cups  green beans , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 2 small  yellow squash  or  zucchini , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 Directions : 
 Combine bake mix,  salt  and  pepper  in a shallow bowl. 
 Dredge  lamb  pieces in mixture. 
 In a large Dutch oven or pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat  oil  over medium heat. 
 Brown  lamb  in batches; transfer to a plate. 
 Add  garlic  and  oregano  to dutch oven and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
 Return  lamb  and accumulated juices to dutch oven. 
 Add  tomatoes ,  water ,  vinegar  and  sugar substitute . 
 Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and simmer until  lamb  is almost tender, 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
 Add  green beans  and  squash  to Dutch oven; mix well. 
 Cook, partially covered, until vegetables are tender, 15 minutes.
