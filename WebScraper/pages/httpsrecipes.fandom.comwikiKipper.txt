A  kipper  is a whole  herring , a small, oily fish, that has been split from tail to head, gutted, salted or pickled, and cold smoked.
 In the United Kingdom and North America they are often eaten grilled for breakfast. In the UK, kippers, along with other preserved fish such as the bloater and buckling, were also once commonly enjoyed as a high tea or supper treat; most popularly with inland and urban working-class populations before World War II.
