Description : 
 These are light, tender, tasty pancakes that the whole family will enjoy. Whether you are into low carb, low glycemic, or low calorie, these are a healthier choice.
 Why it works: The only significant carbs in this recipe are in the whole wheat flour. The unusually high percentage of eggs tends to dilute those carbs and the fiber in the whole wheat flour and the wheat bran helps offset the carbs.
