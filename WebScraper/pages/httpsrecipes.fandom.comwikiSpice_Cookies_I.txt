Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  molasses 
 2 cups  flour 
 ¼ cup  sugar 
 ½ teaspoon  soda 
 1½ tablespoons  butter 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1½ tablespoons  lard 
 ½ teaspoon  clove 
 1 tablespoon  milk 
 ½ teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 Directions : 
 Heat  molasses  to boiling-point. 
 Add  sugar ,  shortening , and  milk . 
 Mix and sift dry ingredients, and add to first mixture. 
 Chill thoroughly. 
 Toss one-fourth of mixture on a floured board and roll as thinly as possible; shape with a small round cutter, first dipped in  flour . 
 Place near together on a buttered sheet and bake in a moderate oven. 
 Gather up the trimmings and roll with another portion of dough. 
 During rolling, the bowl containing mixture should be kept in a cool place, or it will be necessary to add more  flour  to dough, which makes cookies hard rather than crisp and short.
