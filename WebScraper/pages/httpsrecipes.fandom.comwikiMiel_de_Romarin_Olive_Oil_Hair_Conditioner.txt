 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  honey 
 ¼ cup warmed  olive oil  (2 tablespoons for normal to oily hair) 
 4 drops essential  oil  of  rosemary 
 1 teaspoon of  xanthan  gum (available in health food stores) 
 Directions : 
 Place all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. 
 Pour into a clean plastic bottle with a snug-fitting cap. 
 Use : 
 To use, apply a small amount to your slightly dampened hair. 
 Massage your scalp and work the conditioner through your hair until it is completely and evenly distributed. 
 Next, cover your hair with a warm towel (your microwave or dryer can heat it up) or shower cap; leave the conditioner in place on to nourish and condition for 30 minutes. 
 Remove the towel or shower cap; shampoo lightly and rinse with cool  water . 
 Dry as normal and enjoy shinier, softer and healthier hair the natural way.
