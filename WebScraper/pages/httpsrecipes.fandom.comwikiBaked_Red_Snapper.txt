Ingredients : 
 1  red snapper  (large) 
 1 large  Onion  sliced thinly 
 olive  oil  to taste 
 1 can stewed  tomatoes  or just canned  tomatoes  and juice from the can. You can use  tomatoes  you've preserved yourself if you wish 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 2bay leaf and 1/2 tsp of  paprika 
 5  potatoes  cut into wedges 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat pan to 350F or 176C Before Pam  cooking spray  existed, my mom used olive  oil  by pouring some into the pan and then adding the  red snapper  that has been thoroughly washed, cleaned and scaled (fishmongers usually will do this for you). 
 I use the Pam first to keep the fish from sticking and the olive  oil  later. 
 Add the  red snapper  to the pan. 
 Add sliced  Onion , stewed  tomatoes  and it's juice,  potatoes ,  salt  and  pepper ,  bay leaves  and  paprika . 
 Finish by drizzling olive  oil  over the fish and  potatoes . 
 Bake covered for about 35 to 40 minutes. 
 Uncover and test the  Snapper . It should be easy to flake with a fork. 
 Cook uncovered another 20 to 30 minutes to brown the  potatoes  a little. 
 Serve with a glass of wine and a salad and a few slices of freshly baked  bread .
