Description : 
       Sucre's Superb Bread Pudding     
 Sucre's version stands head and shoulders above the rest because it's made from diced croissants and Danish pastries left over from the day before for a subtle interplay of textures and flavors that can differ with each bite.
 At  Sucre Sweet Boutique , they serve the bread pudding with a generous scoop of ice cream sprinkled with chopped pecans, just in case it wasn't rich enough already.
 
 Serves:  About 8 generous servings.    Makes one 9-inch round pan. 
 Ingredients : 
 6 cups day-old  bread  (croissant or danish preferred) 
 1 cup  heavy cream 
 ¾ cup  sour cream 
 4 large  egg yolks 
 ¼ cup whole  milk 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2 teaspoons  vanilla extract 
 2 teaspoons grated  lemon zest 
 2 teaspoons grated  orange zest 
 1½ teaspoons ground  cinnamon 
 Directions : 
 A 9-inch round pan, 2 inches deep, buttered and lined with a disk of parchment paper, cut to fit, and set in another larger pan such as a small roasting pan. 
 Cut the pastries or bread into 1-inch cubes and set aside.. 
 Whisk together the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and fold in the cubed bread. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours or as long as overnight. 
 When you're ready to bake the pudding, set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 325°F. 
 Fill the 9-inch pan with the mixture and add warm water to the larger pan to come about an inch up the side of the smaller pan. 
 Bake the pudding until it is set and firm and the custard is no longer liquid, about 1 hour. 
 Lift the pudding pan from the water and set it on a rack to cool. Then invert the cooled pudding to a platter and remove the pan and paper. 
 Serve wedges of the pudding, warm or at room temperature with ice cream or whipped cream.
