I've been known to throw some chopped celery and spinach in this chicken noodle soup, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2-3 cans, 14-1/2 oz ea, chicken broth 
 Handful of thin egg noodles or your choice of pasta 
 1 carrot, shredded 
 2 cups cooked chopped chicken

 Directions : 
 Over medium heat, stir together broth, noodles and carrots. 
 Bring to a boil and then lower to a simmer. 
 Add chicken to soup, more broth if you need it, and continue to cook until chicken noodles and carrots are tender, about 6-8 minutes longer. 
 Add parsley and garlic powder to taste.
