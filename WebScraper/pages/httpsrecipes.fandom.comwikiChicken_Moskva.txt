       Chicken Moskva     
 Ingredients : 
 1 frying  chicken , cut up 
 ¼ cup  margarine 
 4  green onions ; thinly sliced 
 1  tomato ; diced 
 ¼ cup boiling  water 
 2 tbsp chopped  parsley 
 ½ tsp  sugar 
 salt ,  pepper 
 ½ cup  sour cream 
 1 tsp  flour 
 ½ tsp  paprika 
 thyme  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Rub  chicken  with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Heat  margarine ; brown  chicken  on both sides; add boiling  water ; cover and cook 30 minutes or until  chicken  is done. 
 Remove  chicken  from pan; keep hot. 
 To the juices in pan, add  onions ; cook until soft. 
 (save a bit for garnish from the green tops). 
 Add  tomatoes ; cook until soft as mush; add  thyme  and  parsley . 
 salt  and  pepper  if needed. 
 Mix  sour cream ,  flour ,  paprika ; add to  onions  and  salt . 
 Cook until thick; spoon over  chicken  and serve. 
 Sometimes, due to extenuating weather conditions, the sauce will not thicken enough; when this happens, just swallow your pride and pour over  chicken  anyway; it will still taste great.
