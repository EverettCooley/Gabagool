 Ingredients : 
 6 medium  plum tomatoes , halved 
 2 Tbs. extra-virgin  olive oil 
 1 bunch  Broccoli  (1 1/2 lbs.), cut into florets, stems peeled and sliced diagonally 1/4 inch thick 
 2 large cloves  garlic , thinly sliced 
 3/4 tsp.  coarse salt 
 2 Tbs.  sliced almonds  or  pine nuts 
 2 medium bunches  arugula , trimmed 
 4 tsp.  balsamic vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 450F. Place  tomato  halves in large bowl. Toss with 1/2 tablespoon  oil  and set aside.
 
 Place  Broccoli  on large baking sheet with sides. Drizzle remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons  oil  on top and toss well. Arrange  Broccoli  on baking sheet, leaving room for  tomatoes  (which will be added later). Roast 5 minutes.
 
 Add  tomato  halves in single layer, cut side up. Sprinkle vegetables with  garlic ,  salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste. Return pan to oven and roast until vegetables are just fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
 
 Meanwhile, in small dry skillet, toast  almonds  over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from pan; let cool.
 
 Divide  arugula  among dinner plates. Top with roasted vegetables. Sprinkle with toasted  nuts  and  vinegar  and serve hot.
