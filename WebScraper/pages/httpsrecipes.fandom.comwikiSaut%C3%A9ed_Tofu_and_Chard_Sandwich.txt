 Description :

 Ingredients : 
 firm/extra-firm (organic calcium enriched) 
 handful of FRESH  chard  mix ( I use Trader Joes packaged mix) 
 red onion 
 2 slices, vegan sprouted  grain  bread 
 vegan  mayo  (Veganaise is the best!) 
 organic vegan Dijon  mustard 
 1/2 ripe  avocado 
 herbes de Provence  seasoning 
 granulated  garlic  seasoning 
 olive oil 
 sea salt 
 Directions : 
 1. In a small saucepan heat about 1/4 cup  olive oil  (or more so that it will not stick).
 
 2. Slice off two pieces of  tofu , (vertically so that they are not as wide) and add to pan. Coat both sides in  olive oil  so that they don't stick.
 
 3. Top  tofu  with  herbes de Provence  (I don't measure, so roughly a tablespoon), sprinkle with granulated  garlic  and  sea salt . Cook on both sides until the edges are golden and slightly crispy. Spooning herb mixture over  tofu  as needed. **Sautee at a medium heat, reducing temp if smoke occurs and smoke alarm goes off.
 
 3. Meanwhile, toast bread, slice up  avocado  and thinly slice  red onion .
 
 4. Once the bread has toasted, spread on the  mayo , the  mustard ; lay down the 1 half of an  avocado  and  red onion ; set aside.
 
 5. Once  tofu  has reached desired crispiness, set on top of the  avocado ; set aside.
 
 6. In the same saucepan, add a bit more  olive oil  and saute a handful of fresh  chard  mix until soft. Pile it on top of the  tofu  and top with other slice of toasted bread.
