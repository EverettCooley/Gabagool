 Beat the  yogurt  and  flour  together until there are absolutely no lumps. Add tumeric,  salt  and 3 cups of  water . Heat the 2 tbsp of  oil  in the same pot you fried the pakoras in, and toast the  fenugreek seeds  and dry red  chili pepper  for 30 seconds or so. Add the  yogurt  and  flour  mixture, bring to a boil, and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally.
