Bovril  is the trademarked name of a thick, salty  yeast extract , though it originally was a  beef  extract, developed in the 1870s by John Lawson Johnston and sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar. It is made in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, and distributed by Unilever UK. In November 2004 the manufacturers, Unilever, announced that the composition of Bovril was being changed from beef extract to a yeast extract, to make it more suitable to vegetarians and vegans, but this announcement also coincided with mounting concerns over BSE.
