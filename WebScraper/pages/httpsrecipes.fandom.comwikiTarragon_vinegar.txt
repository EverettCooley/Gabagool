 About tarragon vinegar : 
White vinegar flavored with tarragon. A sprig of tarragon is placed in a glass bottle and then white vinegar is added (a recipe may call for other flavorings to be added along with the tarragon). The bottle is sealed and stored for a period of time to allow the mixture to steep. The vinegar will have an aroma of tarragon with a mild anise flavor. Tarragon vinegar is used to add flavor to cooked vegetables, such as green beans, brussels sprouts, and cabbage, and is used in egg dishes and salad dressings. Its flavor is also a compliment to fish and poultry. When cooked for too long, then tarragon must lose some of its flavor, so it is generally added towards the end of the cooking process.
