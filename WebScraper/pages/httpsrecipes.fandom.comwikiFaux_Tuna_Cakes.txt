 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 15-1/2 oz. can  Chickpeas , rinsed and drained 
 12 oz. box of firm  silken tofu 
 1 Tbsp.  lemon juice 
 1 tsp. granulated  garlic  (or 1-2 cloves fresh  garlic , pressed) 
 1 Tbsp. old bay seasoning 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 12 oz. can of Tuno 
 2 pieces bread, crusts removed, cubed (the original recipe called for white, but I used a grainy whole  Wheat  with success) 
 flour 
 Bread crumbs,  cornmeal , or ground-up fritters 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Blend  Chickpeas  and  tofu  in a food processor, then mixing in  lemon juice ,  garlic , old bay,  salt , and  pepper . 
 Strain/press the Tuno to get rid of as much excess  water  as possible, then combine it with the  Chickpea / tofu  mix. 
 Fold in the cubed bread and a little  flour  at a time until it starts to become a bit sticky. 
 Grab a handful, roll it in breadcrumbs/ cornmeal /fritters, and form into a patty. 
 Pan fry or deep fry the patties until crispy on the outside.
