Ingredients : 
 ½ cup Joy or Dawn dish detergent 
 5 cups  water , distilled is best 
 2 tbsp  glycerine 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dish detergent with the  water  (measure carefully, it makes a big difference). 
 Stir. 
 Add the glycerine (you can usually get this in a drug store), this makes more durable bubbles. 
 Making bubbles : 
 You can bend a wire coat hanger into a circle and wind a string around it. Depending on how big you make your circle, you get great big bubbles. 
 The string helps in getting the liquid to stay on the circle. 
 You can also use straws and string-tie a 2½ foot length of string though two straws and unleash square bubbles. 
 The trick is to dip your string and straw thing into the solution and wave it in the air. 
 Break the bubble off by flipping the apparatus up a bit. 
 Plain straws make good bubble pipes. 
 Also try using the plastic  strawberry  baskets, they make lots of little bubbles. 
 It is fun to experiment with all different bubble makers. Big-time bubble making is a bit like fishing. You'll have much better luck in cool wet weather. Early evenings, nighttime and early mornings are often good. Just after a rain is ideal. 
 Don't throw any leftovers away, the longer it sits the better it becomes.
