       Icelandic donuts     
 Ingredients : 
 3  eggs 
 1 cup  sour cream 
 1 cup  milk  or  buttermilk 
 2 tsp. soda 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 1 tsp.  cream of tartar 
 1 1/2 cups  Sugar 
 1 tsp.  vanilla 
 1 tsp.  nutmeg 
 Enough  flour  to roll (approx. 4 cups) 
 Directions : 
 Beat  eggs  slightly and add  sugar  and beat some more. Gradually add the  sour cream  mixed with soda and  milk  alternately with the dry ingredients. This will take about 4 1/2 cups of  flour . Mix it and pour out onto the floured board and divide into three portions and roll each out to approx. 1/4 inch thick and cut into 1 inch wide strips and then into about 2 1/2 inch long pieces. Put a slit in the centre of each and fold one end through the slit. 
 Fry in deep fat Crisco in an electric deep fryer at about 375 degrees. Keep turning them till they are golden brown, about 3 minutes. 
 After they have drained on paper towel, sprinkle with  powdered sugar  when ready to serve.
