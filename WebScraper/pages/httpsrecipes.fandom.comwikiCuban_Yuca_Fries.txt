 Yuca, also called  cassava , is a tuber that's popular in Latin American and African cooking. 
 Place yuca slices in large saucepan and add enough cold  water  to cover. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer until yuca is tender but still a little firm, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, cut yuca into 1/4-inch-wide strips, discarding any woody cores. 
 In large skillet, heat 2 inches of  oil  to 360 degrees (or use a deep-fat fryer). Cook yuca pieces in batches, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Season with  salt  and  pepper . Serve warm.
