Cover, simmer 50 minutes longer. 5 minutes before  rice  is finished, saute  scallion  until softened. Combi ne with  rice  and  Wheat  mixture, along with spices. Note: the original recipe called for 2 tbs.  pignoli  ( pine nuts ), tosted in 1 tbs  butter , before adding the scallions. I simply eliminated them.
