 To add a final touch, season the  rice  with  salt  and  pepper . 
 The oven should be preheated at 450 degrees Celsius. 
 Stuff the  Lamb  and then saw it up with a strong thread. 
 Place the stuffed lam on large baking tray and put it into the oven, then reduce the heat to about 325 degrees Celsius. 
 The  Lamb  should be roasted for about 2 hours and turned over once or twice for well-done meat.
