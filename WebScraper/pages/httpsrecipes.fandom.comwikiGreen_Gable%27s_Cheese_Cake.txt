 Ingredients : 
 Mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and margarine. 
 Press crumb mixture in bottom and part way up the sides of a lightly sprayed 9 or 10 inch spring form pan. Set aside. 
 Mix the cream cheese, sugar, flour, vanilla, and the lemon juice. Blend well. 
 Add the eggs, beating well after each egg is added. 
 Add the yolks, beat again. 
 Add the heavy cream and beat until all cream is well-incorporated. 
 Pour this mixture into the prepared pan. 
 Bake cake in a preheated 500 degree oven for ten minutes. 
 Reduce heat to 250 degrees and bake for one hour. 
 Remove cake from oven and immediately spread sour cream on top. 
 For best results, remove the sides of pan and place cake in the refrigerator overnight. 
 The next day, place your favorite fruit on top or serve plain.

 You'll need a strong mixer for this.

 She says, "This is an excellent cheese cake. My mom got this recipe from a restaurant that use to be in Columbus in 1960. They were known for this cheese cake. Enjoy."
