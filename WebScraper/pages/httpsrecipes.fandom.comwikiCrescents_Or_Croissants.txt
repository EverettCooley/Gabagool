 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 7/8 c.  milk 
 1  cake yeast 
 1 Tbs.  lard 
 1/3 c. lukewarm  water 
 11/2 Tbs.  Sugar 
 21/2 c.  flour , sifted 
 3/4 tsp.  salt 
 1 c.  butter , softened 
 Directions : 
 Scald  milk ; add  lard ,  Sugar  and  salt . Cool until lukewarm. Dissolve  yeast  in  water  then add to  milk  mixture. Stir in or knead in  flour  to make a soft dough. 
 Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl and turn so all sides are lightly greased. Cover with a damp cloth. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 11/2 hours. Cover the dough with a lid and chill thoroughly, at least 20 minutes. 
 Roll dough out into an oblong 1/4 " thick. 
 Beat  butter  until creamy. Dot 2/3 of the surface of the dough with 1/4 c. of the  butter . Fold the undotted third over the center third. Then, fold the doubled portion over the remaining third of the butter-dotted portion. The dough is now in 3 layers thick. Turn the layered dough a 1/4 turn and repeat again. Do this two more times, making it a total of four times that you roll it and fold it. Cover and chill at least 2 hours. Then roll the dough again on a floured surface. Cut the dough into 3" squares. Cut the squares in half diagonally. Roll the triangular pieces beginning with the wide side and stretching it slightly as you roll. Shape the rolls into crescents. Place on a baking sheet and chill for 1/2 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake them for about 10 to 15 minutes longer or until done.
