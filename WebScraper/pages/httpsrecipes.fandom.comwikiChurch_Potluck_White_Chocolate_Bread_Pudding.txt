 Ingredients : 
 5 large  eggs 
 Â¼ pound unsalted  butter 
 1 cup  heavy cream  at room temperature 
 2 cups  milk  at room temperature 
 1 loaf  raisin bread , crumbled 
 1-1/4 pound grated  white chocolate 
 3/4 cup  sugar 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350. Remove the crust from the bread and soak it in the heated  milk  and  cream . 
 Beat the mixture by hand or in a mixer until the pieces of bread are reduced to the size you want. 
 Melt the  chocolate  and  butter  in a double boiler and incorporate that into the bread mixture. 
 In a separate mixing bowl, beat the  eggs  and  Sugar  until creamy. 
 Add that to the bread mixture and stir until uniform. 
 Transfer the batter to a buttered pan and place that pan in a larger pan of hot  water  in the oven.
