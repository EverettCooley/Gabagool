 Ingredients : 
 2 large  leeks 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Remove the root end and green tops of the  leeks  with a sharp knife, leaving only the white and pale green section. Rinse thoroughly under running  water  to remove any mud or grit. Cut the  leeks  into 2" pieces. Skewer the  leek  pieces onto a bamboo skewer. For easier handling, cut each skewer in half with a pair of sharp kitchen scissors or garden shears. Brush with  olive oil . Heat an electric grill, stovetop grill pan or outdoor grill and cook  leeks  until tender, turning to lightly brown on each side. Serve hot or cold.
