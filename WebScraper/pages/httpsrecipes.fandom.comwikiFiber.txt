Also referred to as roughage, dietary fiber (fibre in UK English) is found in plants. It is that portion of plant-related foods (such as fruits, legumes, vegetables and whole grains) that cannot be completely digested. It has no calories because the body cannot absorb it. Although it isn't absorbed it helps the bowels to function healthily and improves general health.
