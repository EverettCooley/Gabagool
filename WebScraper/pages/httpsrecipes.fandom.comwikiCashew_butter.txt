About cashew butter : 
 Cashew butter is a delicious and creamy nut butter spread that you can make at home or purchase, though it may be a little hard to find. Similar to  peanut butter , cashew butter is made of ground cashews, but it may contain additional ingredients, including different oils like safflower oil, which can make this butter creamier. Depending on the company or your own preference if youâ€™re making it at home, cashew butter may be made of raw or roasted cashews and may contain salt.
