About preserved lemon : 
 Preserved lemon or lemon pickle is a condiment that is common in North African cuisine, especially Moroccan cuisine. It is also known as "country lemon" and leems. Diced, quartered, halved, or whole lemons are pickled in a brine of water, lemon juice, and salt; occasionally spices are included as well. The pickle is allowed to ferment at room temperature for weeks or months before it is used. The pulp of the preserved lemon can be used in stews and sauces, but it is the peel (zest and pith together) that is most valued. The flavor is mildly tart but intensely lemony.
 Preserved lemons are used by many chefs today because of their distinct flavor and smooth texture. The lemons are preserved in a mixture of salt and lemon juice for approximately 25 to 30 days. The mixture will sometimes have other spices such as cinnamon and cloves added.
