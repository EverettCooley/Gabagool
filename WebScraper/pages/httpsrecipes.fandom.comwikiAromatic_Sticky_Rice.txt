Description : 
 I made this in a cooking class at Leith's in London. It's a very simple  rice  that always turns out like the  rice  served in Thai restaurants in London.
 
       Aromatic Sticky Rice     
 Ingredients : 
 225 g Thai  jasmine rice 
 425 ml  water 
 1 stalk  lemongrass , bruised 
 1  whole red chile 
 2Â½ cm fresh  gingerroot , peeled and bruised 
 1 clove  garlic , peeled 
 Directions : 
 Put all the ingredients into a large  saucepan  and let stand for five minutes. 
 Cover the pan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes until the  water  is absorbed. 
 Remove the pan from the heat and allow to stand covered for five further minutes. 
 Remove the flavourings, if wished, and pile into a serving dish. 
 Serve immediately, while very hot.
