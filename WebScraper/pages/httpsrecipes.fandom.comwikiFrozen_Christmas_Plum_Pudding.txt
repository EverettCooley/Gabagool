Description : 
 A southern-hemisphere Christmas plum pudding - in the southern hemisphere they have a summer Christmas so they have adapted some of the more traditional festive fare to local conditions. Here is one example: it is very easy, and it can be made up to a week ahead of using. The original recipe called for the use of a microwave to do the heating and cooking. This works well for melting the  gelatine  but is a bit of a nuisance otherwise.
 
 Difficulty: easy to moderate (timing matters). 
 Time: 15 minutes preparation, overnight freezing. 
 Yield: serves 8 – 10 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cup  dried fruits  (mixed) finely chopped
