A traditional cheese of France and Switzerland made from cow's milk that typically will contain almost 50 percent milkfat. When produced in Switzerland, the cheese is referred to as Vacherin Mont d'Or and is made with pasteurized milk. The French version is known simply as Mon d'Or and is produced with raw milk. After aging for two to three months, the cheese forms a crust that encases a soft, creamy texture with small holes throughout the cheese. This cheese provides a mild, rich nutty flavor with a distinctive aroma. Because this cheese is so soft, it is very spreadable and may be eaten with a spoon.
