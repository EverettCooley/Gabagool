 About Soda water : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Soda water on Wikipedia 
 Carbonated water , also known as  soda water ,  sparkling water , or  seltzer water , is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved. The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation. It results in the formation of carbonic acid (which has the chemical formula H 2 CO 3 ). Club soda may be identical to plain carbonated water or it may contain a small amount of table salt, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium sulfate, or disodium phosphate, depending on the bottler.
