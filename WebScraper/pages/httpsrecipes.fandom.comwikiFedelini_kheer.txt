 Description : 
 Fedelini is a kind of pasta. Kheer/payesh/payasam/etc., is a sweet dish of milk, sugar and rice or sewai (kind of rice noodles). To get in a new type to it and finish off the extra fidelini leftover in my pantry, I decided to make this preparation.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 tbsp  Fedelini 
 1 tbsp Butter/ghee 
 340gms  Condensed milk 
 2 cups Milk 
 1/2 cup Sugar 
 1 tbsp Quarkfein (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Add the condensed milk and milk at low heat for 10 minutes. 
 Fry the fidelini in butter/ghee for 5 minutes. Then add the mixture to the milk mixture and heat for 10 minutes. 
 Once the milk is reduced to half the amount add the sugar and Quarkfein and heat 10 minutes.
