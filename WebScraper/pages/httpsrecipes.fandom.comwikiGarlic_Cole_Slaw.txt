 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased 
the family collection from the Hoffman Estate in Grand Prairie, Texas 
in 1992.

 1 teaspoon salt 
 2/3 cup granulated sugar 
 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar 
 1 cup whipping cream 
 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
 8 cups finely shredded cabbage (green and purple) 
 Directions : 
 In a bowl whisk together salt, sugar, vinegar, cream, mayonnaise and 
garlic.
Pour over cabbage and toss to coat.
Refrigerate for at least two hours and serve chilled.
