Description : 
 Serves: 6 – 8 
 Ingredients : 
 2 small bunches of  cardoons 
 8 tablespoons of  olive oil 
 4 tablespoons of your preferred  vinegar  or juice of 2  lemons 
 ½ teaspoon of  sugar  (optional) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 parsley  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Preparing the Cardoons : 
 When preparing cardoons for cooking, wear utility gloves to avoid staining your hands. 
 Prepare a large bowl with enough water to soak the cardoons after they are trimmed, add to it 1 full tablespoon of salt and the juice of a lemon to prevent discoloration. 
 Cut and discard about 1 inch from the top and trim the base far up enough so that the stalks can be easily separated. 
 Using a potato peeler, remove the strings from the stalks, cut cardoons across into 2 inches pieces and place in the basin with the acidulated and salted water. 
 Drain and rinse the cardoons. 
 Place them in a large pot, add 1 and ½ tablespoons of salt cover with cold water 2 inches above the cardoons and bring to a boil. 
 Lower heat and simmer uncovered. 
 After 45 minutes check if they are tender or cook for an additional 15 minutes to ½ hour until they are ready. 
 Place the cardoons in a colander to drain and cool. 
 Shake a few times to eliminate excess water. 
 Preparing the Salad : 
 Blend together olive oil, vinegar, sugar and pepper. 
 Set aside. 
 Arrange the cardoons in a serving dish and taste for salt, add if needed. 
 Drizzle the dressing over the cardoons. 
 Garnish with parsley and serve at room temperature.
