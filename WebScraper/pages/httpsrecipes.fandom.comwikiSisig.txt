       Sisig     
 Description : 
 Sisig . A unique Pinoy savory and sometimes spicy  pork  dish whose preparation methods vary with every household. Sisig is simply  pork , grilled on open coals or deep fried, and then chopped and seasoned well. As I’ve said, the choice of seasonings differ. The choice of the cut of meat also depends on the person cooking it. Usually, the cheeks of the hog are used.
