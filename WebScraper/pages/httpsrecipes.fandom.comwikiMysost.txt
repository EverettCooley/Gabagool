 About Mysost : 
 A Scandinavian cheese made from cow's milk which has a soft spreadable texture providing a semi-sweet taste. The sweetness is derived caramelizing the milk sugars of the whey as it is made. Also known as Primost cheese, this cheese is very similar to  Gjetost  cheese, except Gjetost is made from a combination of goat and cow's milk or strictly goat's milk (Ekta Gjestost). The caramelized cheeses are often served with dark bread or Norwegian flatbread, as a dessert cheese, or as a cheese melted into a variety of food dishes.
