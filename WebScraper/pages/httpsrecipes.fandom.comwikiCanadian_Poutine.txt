 1 part  chicken bouillon  (preferably powder) to 1 part  beef  or  veal bouillon 
 1 tbsp  flour 
 1 tbsp of  butter  or  margarine

 Directions : 
 Traditional poutine gravy : 
 Take the bouillon powder and mix with the  water , all depending on how many people you are serving. 
 Most family size meals use approx. 
 3 cups of  water . 
 Mix the  water  and bouillon in a sauce pan. 
 Bring to a boil. 
 In a cup mix the  flour  and  oil . It should make somewhat of a liquid (a paste) you can substitute  cornstarch  for the  flour  mixture (which reduces the cholesterol count). 
 Slowly add the mixture to the boiling bouillon. 
 You don't want to add too much of the mixture or it will taste like  flour . 
 Just add little by little while stirring the bouillon until it is thick. 
 Once thick take it off the heat. 
 To finish the poutine : 
 Take your cooked fries, add the  cheese curd  and pour generous amount of the gravy on the top.
