 Don't handle the dough too much. 
 Form dough into little fingers and twist together like crossing legs and lay on an ungreased cookie sheet. 
 Bake at 350Â°F for 12 to 15 minutes until light brown on bottom. 
 Allow to cool before icing tops. 
 Sugar icing : 
 In a small bowl, make a mound of confectioners'  sugar . 
 Add one capful of extract to mound and slowly add some  water  a little at a time to make a thick paste. 
 Stir in  lemon juice . 
 Dip the top of the cookie into the sugar paste, allowing excess to drip off. 
 Top with sprinkles, if desired, while the cookie is still wet.
