Ingredients : 
 1½ lb  chicken breast , skinned and 
 cubed 6 tbsp  butter ,  ghee  or  vegetable oil 
 1 tsp  saffron  ground or yellow  food coloring 
 4 tbsp  milk 
 4 tsp  garlic  purée 
 8 tbsp  onion  purée 
 2 tsp  garam masala 
 2½ oz natural  yoghurt 
 5 fl. oz  double cream 
 2 tbsp  ground almonds 
 20  saffron  strands (about 1/10 gram) 
 salt  to taste 
 garnish - 2 tbsp chopped fresh  coriander leaves  ( cilantro ) 
 30  almonds  whole, roasted 
 Directions : 
 Heat the gee and mix the  saffron  powder or coloring with  milk . 
 Heat the  oil  and quickly 'seal' the  chicken  cubes by turning frequently for 2 minutes, then add the yellow  milk  and stir-fry for 2 minutes. 
 Add the  garlic  and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add  onion  and stir-fry for 3 minutes enough to remove the moisture content. 
 Now add the  garam masala  and stir-fry for 2 more minutes. 
 Your total frying time is around 10 minutes, and the  chicken  is half cooked. 
 Add the  yoghurt ,  cream  and  ground almonds  and when it starts to simmer turn the heat down and stir-fry for 10 minutes more to ensure it does not stick, adding  milk  or  water  as necessary. 
 Place  saffron  strands in a little warm  water  and extract as much color as you can by gently mashing with a teaspoon. 
 Check that the  chicken  is cooked right through by cutting a large piece across. 
 Simmer on if required. 
 Just prior to serving add the  saffron  and  salt  to taste. 
 Garnish with the coriander and  almonds , and serve immediately.
