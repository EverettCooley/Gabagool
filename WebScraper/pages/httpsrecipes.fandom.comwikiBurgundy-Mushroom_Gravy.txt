Description : 
 My notes:
 
 created in California, 1976. 
 When Cathe first gave me this recipe (mid '80s), it said to sauté the  onion  in 1 tbsp  olive oil  (then remove  onions ). Then cook only ½ pound of  mushrooms  in the  oil , and add ¼ tsp  garlic salt  (no  garlic flakes ). The recipe said to brown the  mushrooms  until no juice was left and  mushrooms  were "squeaky." Then add half the wine, cook down, add rest of wine, and cook down. Return  onions  and add just 1 tablespoon of  butter ; stir in ¼ cup of  flour , stirring frequently, till very brown. Then it said to add half the  chicken broth , mix well, add rest, and cook at "gentle bubble" till thickened. If too thick, add up to ½ cup of  water ; cook at slow bubble till  flour  taste is gone. 
 Ingredients : 
 4 tbsp  butter 
 1 lbs  mushrooms  (fresh), cleaned trimmed and sliced thinly 
 1 large  onion , finely chopped 
 1 cup  burgundy wine  (or other  red wine ) 
 4 tbsp  flour 
 10 oz  chicken broth  (canned) 
 1 cup  water  (more as needed) 
 ½ tbsp  garlic flakes , dried 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  butter  in a small pan (about 1-quart size). 
 Add the  mushrooms  to the pan and cook over medium heat until all the liquid that cooks out of them has evaporated and you just have the  oil  from the  butter  (in the pan with the  mushrooms ). 
 Stir frequently so they brown, but do not burn. 
 Add the chopped  onion  and  red wine . 
 Continue cooking until all the liquid has cooked out (you are left with just the  oil  from the  butter  in the pan, with the  mushrooms  and  onions ). 
 It is very important that there be no liquid left in the pan other than the  oil  from the  butter . 
 The  onions  may cook down until you can't see them. 
 Add the  flour  to the  mushroom  mixture. 
 Stir well so that the  oil  from the  butter  is absorbed by the  flour . 
 Add the entire can of  chicken broth  at once and stir well. 
 The broth and the  flour / butter  mixture should combine to make a thick liquid. 
 This may not thicken until it starts to boil. 
 Stir constantly, or the mixture will stick to the bottom of the pan. 
 Add enough  water  to make the gravy have a consistency you like. 
 I like mine thick, so a cup of  water  is enough. 
 Lower the heat. 
 Add the dried minced  garlic  and cook over low heat until the  garlic flakes  absorb enough liquid to no longer be crunchy.
