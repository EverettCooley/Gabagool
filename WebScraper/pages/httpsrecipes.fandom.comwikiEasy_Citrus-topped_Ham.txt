 Description : 
 This recipe creates a very tasty succulent ham and is so easy to prepare. I created the recipe 25 years ago when my brother and his wife showed up unexpectedly, and I had to rely on what was on hand to create a meal for 8 people My brother raved and raved about the flavor and texture of the ham, so I knew I'd created a winner. Since then I have used this technique for fixing ham for holiday and church potluck dinners. The leftovers make divine Monte Cristo sandwiches, split pea soup, minestrone, and chef salads.
