Ingredients : 
 4 cups  water 
 10  mauby bark 
 2  cinnamon  sticks (small) 
 2 (4 inch) pieces of  orange  peel (dried) 
 nutmeg  (see note below) 
 3-4  cloves 
 Instructions : 
 In a deep saucepan place all the ingredients and on a med/high heat, bring it to a boil. 
 You now have two options. If you’re intention is to make this mauby juice immediately, allow it to simmer for about 30 minutes. If you’re like me and in no rush, all you do is allow it to go for 5 minutes at a rolling boil, then turn off the stove, cover the pot and allow it to steep for about 5 hours. I usually allow it to steep overnight for best results. Both options gives you a mauby concentrate. All you have to do is … for every cup of concentrate add 2 cups of water, then sweeten to your liking. For the perfect glass of mauby, I usually sweeten with cane sugar and hit it with a couple drops of Angostura bitters… top with crushed ice and a slice of lime or lemon! 
 Strain and store in a glass (or plastic I guess) in the fridge.
