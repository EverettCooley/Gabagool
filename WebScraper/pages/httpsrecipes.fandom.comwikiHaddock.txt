 About Haddock : 
 Haddock is a very delicious and popular marine fish that is distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic. It has some features, being easily recognised by a black line running along its white side. It is usually found at depths of 40 to 133 m and thrives in temperatures of 2 °C to 10 °C. Young fish are characterised by long migratory behaviour and they also prefer shallower water, while adult haddock prefer deeper water. Haddock feed on small invertebrates but it can occasionally eat fish. An average-sized female produces almost 850,000 eggs while larger females can produce no less that 3 million eggs every year. Haddock can reach 110 cm in size and it can be sold smoked, fresh, dried, frozen or even canned. Norwegian fishballs have haddock as the main ingredient as it is a great source of protein, vitamin B12, pyridoxine, and selenium, containing also sodium and potassium.
