 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 c.  vegetable oil 
 2 medium-sized green  plantains , peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2" thick slices 
 Directions : 
 In a heavy 12 inch skillet, heat the  oil  over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. 
 Add as many  plantain  slices as you can without crowding the pan, and brown for about 2 minutes on each side. 
 As they crown, transfer them to paper towels to drain. 
 On a board, using a broad solid (not slotted) spatula, press each slice into a flat round about 1/4 inch thick and 2 inches in diameter. 
 Heat the  oil  and fry the rounds again for about 1 minute on each side. 
 Drain on paper towels and serve at once.
