 Serves 16 
 Ingredients : 
 6 lbs  ground beef 
 4 large  onions , chopped 
 6 cans  chili beans  (15½ oz each) 
 6 cans  enchilada hot sauce  (10 oz each) 
 salt  to taste 
 5 heads  iceberg lettuce , coarsely chopped 
 1 bottle  Italian salad dressing  (8 oz) 
 6 to 7 bunches  green onions , chopped 
 10 to 12 fresh  tomatoes , chopped 
 2 lbs shredded sharp  cheddar  cheese 
 3 pkg.  corn chips  (7 oz each), coarsely crumbled 
 Directions : 
 Select a covered roasting pan with a tight fitting cover. 
 Put meat in roaster and cook stirring over medium heat, until it loses its redness. 
 Add  onions  and cook until  onions  become transparent. 
 Add beans and enchilada sauce, rinsing each can with a little  water  and adding the  water  to the pan. 
 Bring to boil. 
 Add  salt , starting with 2 tbsp then taste and ad a bit more, if needed. 
 Cover and cook in a 225°F oven for at least 8 hours. 
 Overnight is better. 
 To assemble your Mexican buffet, put  lettuce  in large salad bowl and toss with dressing to coat each bite. 
 Put  onions ,  tomatoes ,  cheese  and  corn  chips in separate bowls. 
 Guests serve themselves, starting with a plate full of  lettuce , then spoonfuls of  onions ,  tomatoes ,  cheese , and a whopping ladle of hot  chili  and a topping of  corn chips . 
 If possible, it is well to cook the  chili  a day or 2 ahead, then cool and refrigerate. 
 When chilled, the fat may be lifted off the top, then reheated to serve.
