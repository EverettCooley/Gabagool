 Ingredients : 
 8 cups  rolled oats 
 1 cup  nuts  (more if desired -- up to double this amount) 
 ½ cup  sunflower seeds 
 ½ cup whole  millet   or  whole  buckwheat groats 
 3 cups  whole wheat flour  (or more)  or  part  cornmeal 
 rice flour   or  other whole grain flour 
 1 tsp  salt  (or more, as desired) 
 ½ cup  honey  (or more -- up to double this amount  [1] ) 
 1 cup hot  water , or up to 2 cups hot  water 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 In a large bowl or pot, combine  oats ,  nuts , seeds,  millet ,  flour , and  salt . 
 Mix together honey,  water , and  vanilla , and stir into dry ingredients. 
 Spread on a lightly oiled baking sheet and squeeze mixture together to form small chunks, but don"t crowd; the chunks need to bake clear through. 
 Roast until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes (with the larger amount of  water , reduce heat and bake longer). 
 As it bakes the granola may need stirring to brown evenly. 
 Cool thoroughly before storing. 
 Variations : 
 Replace part of the  water  with the freshly squeezed juice of 2  oranges  (and add the grated rinds if the  oranges  were not sprayed with pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons  orange   oil .
 For "gingerbread" granola, use half  molasses  (for half honey) and add 2 teaspoons  cinnamon , 1 teaspoon  ginger  and ¼ teaspoon cloves.
 For a nice change, substitute  maple syrup  for honey.
 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   more  water  makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.
