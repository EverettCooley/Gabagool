Description : 
 Some traditional Icelandic desserts can be difficult to make in America because they require ingredients not easily available. But here´s one recipe that is very popular and very traditional and very easy. Actually, we would rather have pancakes for a  coffee  party than for dessert - but they are a delicious dessert also.
 Icelandic crepes
 
       Icelandic Crepes     
 Ingredients : 
 3 Eggs 
 2 cups  milk 
 1 cup all purpose  flour 
 1/2 tsp  baking powder 
 1 tsp  Sugar 
 1/2 tsp  vanilla  OR  lemon extract 
 3 tbsp  butter 
 whipped cream 
 jam 
 Directions : 
 Whisk  eggs  and  milk  together. 
 Sift  flour  and  baking powder  into a bowl and mix  egg  mixture into it, until the batter is absolutely smooth. 
 Add  Sugar  and  vanilla  or  lemon extract . 
 Melt the  butter  in the pancake pan but do not let it change color. Add to batter when melted. Pour a couple of tablespoons of batter on one side of the pan and turn it around until the batter covers the surface. These crepes should be as thin as possible. 
 When the crepe is golden brown, turn it and cook for a few seconds on the other side. Turn on a plate to cool and cook the rest of the crepes. Spread some jam on the center of the cooled crepes, add a large dollop of  whipped cream , fold in half and then fold again to make a triangle. Arrange overlapped on a plate and serve.
