 2 inch piece of  papaya  with peel, ground 
 1 tsp  ginger  /  garlic 
 ½ tsp  allspice 
 ¼ tsp  turmeric powder

 Apply this mixture all over the meat pieces and let it marinate for 2 hours. 
 Then fry the onions in the heated oil till they are light golden. 
 Add the meat to the onions and stir occasionally. 
 Cook till the meat is tender and flakes off slightly. 
 When the oil floats on top, add coal to the dum i.e. put the piece of coal directly on a flame. 
 When it becomes red put it on a small piece of roti or bread or a small receptacle made of aluminium foil. 
 Place this in the pan containing the food. 
 Pour 1 tsp of oil on the piece of coal. 
 Immediately cover the pan with a lid for 5 minutes.
