 Description : 
 This recipe should start as 'Raise unsexed baby chickens for 6 months. When roosters become too loud for their immediate environment, carefully cull. Behead, pluck and gut.' Our roosters are free range chooks who are used to flying, foraging and generally having a very nice life. They are MUCH bigger than your typical commercially raised  Chicken  - almost twice the size of a large commercial  Chicken  and they have a much more gamey taste. Unfortunately singing with full throated joy like Pavarotti is not appropriate in suburbia, and when even a dark garden shed cannot contain the sound, it is reluctantly time for silence.
