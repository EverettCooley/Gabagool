 In tropical and subtropical climates the eggplant can be sown directly into the garden. Eggplant grown in temperate climates fares better when transplanted into the garden after all danger of frost. Seeds are typically started six to eight weeks prior to the frost free date.
 Many pests and diseases which afflict other solanaceous vegetables, i.e. tomato, pepper (capsicum), potato, etc. are also troublesome in eggplant. For this reason, eggplant should not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. Four years should separate successive crops of eggplant. Common North American pests include potato beetle, flea beetle, aphids and spider mites. Many of these can be controlled using Bacillus thurengensis (Bt) which is a bacterium that attacks the soft bodied larvae. Adults can be controlled by hand removal. Flea beetles can be especially difficult to control. Good sanitation on crop rotation practices are extremely important in controlling fulgal disease in eggplant, the most serious of which is Verticillium.
