 Directions : 
 Combine the salt, paprika, cumin, thyme, and cayenne in a small bowl. 
 Rub the mixture all over the salmon. 
 Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat. 
 Add the salmon and cook 5 minutes on each side, or until barely translucent in the center. 
 While the fish is cooking, combine the cucumber, yogurt, lemon juice and dill in a bowl; let stand at room temperature to allow the flavors to develop. 
 Serve each piece of salmon with a dollop of the cucumber salsa.
