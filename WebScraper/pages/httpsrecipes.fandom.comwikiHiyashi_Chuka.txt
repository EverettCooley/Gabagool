Description : 
 Japanese summer salad with egg noodles and ham. This is a delicious salad served only in the summertime in Japan. I really miss being able to drop by the convenience store and pick up one of these for a fast and easy meal. It's wonderfully refreshing, especially when there's no air conditioning available. Cook time refers to boiling noodles.
