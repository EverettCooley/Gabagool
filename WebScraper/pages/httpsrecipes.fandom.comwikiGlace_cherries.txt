 About Glace cherries : 
 Glace or candied cherries are the most common  candied fruit .
 They are made by soaking  cherries  in a  sugar syrup . The sugar syrup replaces all the natural moisture in the cherries. This preserves them, making them very sweet at the same time.
 Candied cherries are often dyed with an edible artificial dye, or with red  grape juice , to reinforce a jolly red colour. They also come in different colours, including natural and food dye inspired colours to make them green or yellow.
 They are used in baking, especially in fruit cakes.
