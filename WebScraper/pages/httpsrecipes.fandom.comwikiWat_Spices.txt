 Directions : 
 A wat is a traditional Ethiopian stew, spiced either with  berbere  or this simpler blend of spices. The recipe below is taken from A Safari of African Cooking by Bill Odarty. 
 Roast spices over a low flame. Pound them in order to break up big pieces. 
 Place a pinch of  turmeric  on the grinding stone and grind until a yellow coating of  turmeric  is spread over the working surface. Grind all the other spices together on the yellow grinding stone. These spices are added to the wat towards the end of cooking.
