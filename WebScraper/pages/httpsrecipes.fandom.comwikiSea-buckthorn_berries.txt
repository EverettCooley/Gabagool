About sea-buckthorn berries : 
 The female sea-buckthorn plants produce orange berries 6â€“9 mm in diameter, soft, juicy and rich in oils. Sea-buckthorn berries are edible and nutritious, though very acidic (astringent) and oily, unpleasant to eat raw, unless 'bletted' (frosted to reduce the astringency) and/or mixed as a juice with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice.
