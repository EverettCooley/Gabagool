 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 300 g ground  Pork 
 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
 1/4 teaspoon  pepper 
 1 teaspoon  Sugar 
 1 tablespoon  sake  or dry  sherry 
 1  egg , beaten 
 2 teaspoons sesame  oil 
 300 g finely grated  cabbage 
 4 spring  onions , finely chopped 
 20-25  egg  roll wraps (I use Blue Dragon brand) 
 1 tablespoon vegetable  oil 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  Pork , soy sauce,  pepper ,  Sugar ,  sake ,  egg , sesame  oil ,  cabbage  and  green onions  in a bowl.   
Refrigerate for one hour.   
Take a wrapper and prepare according to instructions (mine require soaking for 20 seconds) until soft and pliable.   
Take a bit of  Pork  and roll it into a ball, about the size of a golf ball or just slightly smaller.   
Put it in the centre of the wrapper and fold the wrapper around until the  Pork  is covered and you have a neat little parcel.   
It may flatten out into little patties as you fold the wrapping around the  Pork .   
Continue until all the wrappers are filled.   
Heat the  oil  in a non-stick frying pan.   
Fry the spring rolls until they are brown and crispy on both sides.   
Serve immediately, with some soy sauce mixed with  chilli   oil  for dipping in.
