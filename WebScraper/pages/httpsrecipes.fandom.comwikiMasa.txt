 About Masa : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Masa on Wikipedia 
 Masa, or masa nixtamalera, is a fine maize dough made from corn boiled with lime and ground in a molino (a mill dedicated to that purpose). It can also be made by adding water to masa harina, which is ground hominy flour. It is used in the making of tortillas, tamales, pupusas, and many other dishes from Mexico, Central America, and South America. Masa is a very ancient food product, dating back some 10,000 years.
 Another use of masa is for thickening sauces or stews, particularly chili con carne.
 In Mexican cuisine, it can also be cooked with water and/or milk to make a thick, gruel-like beverage called atole. When made with chocolate and sugar, it becomes atole de chocolate or champurrado.
