 Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 3  eggs 
 1¾ cups  milk 
 8 thin pancakes 
 Directions : 
 Mix all together with a mixer or by hand until free of lumps. 
 Spray frying pan with"pam" and heat over high heat until hot. 
 Reduce heat and pour approx ⅓ cup of batter in center and tilt to cover entire bottom of pan. 
 When small bubbles form and bottom begins to brown, flip and cook other side. 
 We like to eat these sprinkled with  sugar  and rolled up.
