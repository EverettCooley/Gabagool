 Ingredients : 
 fresh beans 
 oil 
 ½  onion 
 ½ tsp  black pepper 
 ¼ to ½ diced small  green pepper 
 1 tbsp  chili powder 
 2 tbsp  tomato paste  (optional) 
 2 tsp  chicken broth  granules 
 Directions : 
 Soak the beans over night, or bring  water  to a boil, turn off the stove and let the beans sit for an hour. 
 Discard that soaking  water  and wash beans thoroughly. 
 Heat pot, coat the bottom of the pan with a little  oil , and refill with  water  (the  oil  helps to prevent sticking). 
 In addition to  onion , add ¼ to ½ diced small  green pepper . 
 Add 1 tbsp  chili powder  (Gebhart's, if possible). 
 Optionally, add 2 tbsp  tomato paste . 
 Add 2 tsp  chicken broth  granules (all of this adds lots of flavor and body to the beans). 
 Cook the beans until really soft. 
 Turn off the fire, cover and lit stand for an hour. 
 In the tropics, the beans will continue to cook!. 
 For refried beans : 
 Coat the bottom of an iron skillet or aluminum roaster with  coconut oil . 
 Add beans and cook until the mix begins to thicken. 
 Smash up the beans with a potato masher, or a Cuisinart "Quick Prep" (This is really the only thing the Quick Prep is good for, but boy is it good for this!!) Add 1 can Salsa Casera, and continue to cook until the beans thicken to the right consistency.
