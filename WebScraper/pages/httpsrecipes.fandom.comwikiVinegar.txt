 About Vinegar : 
 Vinegar  (from Old French vinaigre, meaning "sour wine") is a sour-tasting liquid made from the oxidation of ethanol in  wine , cider,  beer , fermented fruit juice, or nearly any other liquid containing alcohol. It will also be made by certain  bacteria  operating on sugar-water solutions directly, without intermediary conversion to  ethanol  (see  acetic acid ). Commercially available vinegar usually has a  pH  of about 2.4.
