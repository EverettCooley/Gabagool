 About Fluted pumpkin : 
 Telfairia occidentalis is a tropical vine grown in West Africa as a leaf vegetable and for its edible seeds. Common names for the plant include Fluted gourd, Fluted pumpkin, and Ugu.
 The plant is a drought-tolerant, dioecious perennial that is usually grown trellised.
 The young shoots and leaves of the female plant are the main ingredients of a Nigerian soup, edikang ikong.
 The large (up to 5 cm), dark-red seed is rich in fat and protein, and can be eaten whole, ground into powder for another kind of soup, or made into a fermented porridge.
 The fruit of the plant is large, weighing up to 13 kg, but inedible.
