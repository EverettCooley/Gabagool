Ingredients : 
 Oat Crust : 
 1½ cups  rolled oats  blended into  flour  in a food processor (or substitute whole  wheat   pastry flour ) 
 ½ cup  barley flour 
 ¼ cup  water 
 ¼ cup  canola oil 
 ¼ cup  maple syrup 
 Filling : 
 ½ ripe  papaya 
 ½ cup  canola oil 
 2 packages extra  firm tofu 
 ¾ cup  maple syrup 
 ¼ teaspoon  sea salt 
 2 teaspoons  arrowroot 
 2 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 1½ teaspoons  vanilla extract 
 Mango Glaze : 
 ½ ripe  mango 
 1 tablespoon  maple syrup 
 1 tablespoon  arrowroot  dissolved in ¼ cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Whip  papaya  and  oil  in a food processor. 
 Add the  tofu  and blend well, until the texture is very creamy. 
 Blend in remaining ingredients. 
 Pour into the oat crust and bake at 350ºf for 50 minutes until the top is light brown and the cake is set firm. 
 Let cool before adding the  mango  glaze. 
 Add the  maple syrup  and diluted  arrowroot  to a small pot and simmer on medium heat for about 3 minutes. 
 Add mixture to the  mango  in food processor and blend until smooth. 
 Pour over the already set, cooled down cheesecake. 
 Refrigerate for several hours - overnight would be best. 
 When ready to serve, take a wet knife and run it around the outer edge of the cake to loosen it from the side of the pan. 
 With your hands on the bottom of the pan, press up so that the cake moves up out of the frame.
