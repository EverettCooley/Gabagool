 Ingredients : 
 Carcass and giblets of 1  Chicken 
 3-4 stalks  celery  with leaves, sliced 
 2  leeks , sliced (optional) 
 2-3 cloves  garlic , slivered 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 Juice of 1-2  lemons 
 2-3  zucchini , sliced (optional) 
 3/4 cup  rice , boiled (measure uncooked) 
 Directions : 
 1) Collect a  Chicken  carcass, giblets, and bones to make a rich stock. The giblets must be very fresh, and the bones and carcass those of a 
 Chicken  prepared the same day, otherwise any meat on them will be hard and dry, and the marrow in the bones very stale. Crack the bones slightly to release more flavor.
 3) Put the carcass, bones, and giblets in a large pan. Add the  celery  and, if you like, sliced  leeks . Add the slivered  garlic  and cover with about 9 cups  water . Bring to the boil and skim the scum off the surface. Season with  salt  and  pepper , and squeeze the juice of 1  lemon  into the pan. Simmer gently for about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the heat and discard all the bones, leaving only pieces of  Chicken  in the broth. 
 4) Add the  zucchini , if using them, and cook for 15 minutes longer. 
 5) Adjust seasoning, adding more  lemon juice  if necessary. The soup should have a distinctly lemony tang. It is this and the taste of  garlic  which give it an Oriental flavor
 6) Add cooked  rice  just before serving so as not to give it time to become sodden and mushy.
