Description : 
 This is a great appetizer that can be made ahead of time and reheated in the oven or on a grill. I love to stir in freshly chopped  cilantro  before pouring into baking pan. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  water 
 1½ cups  milk 
 2 tablespoons  butter 
 1 ounce  onion soup mix 
 1 cup yellow  cornmeal 
 ½ cup whole kernel  corn 
 ½ cup  bell peppers , chopped 
 1  jalapeno pepper  or  cherry pepper , chopped, to taste (I like more) 
 ½ cup shredded  Cheddar  cheese or  feta 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 Bring the  water ,  milk  and  butter  to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan. 
 With a wire whisk, stir in the  cornmeal  and  onion soup mix . 
 Simmer uncovered, stirring constantly, for about 20 minutes or until thickened. 
 Stir in  corn  and  peppers . 
 Spread the mixture in a lightly greased 9-inch square baking pan and sprinkle with the  cheese . 
 Bake in 350 °F oven for about 20 minutes. 
 Let stand until cool and firm. 
 When cool, cut into triangles. 
 (cut into larger squares and cut squares in half to form triangles). 
 At this point it can be refrigerated or frozen. 
 When ready to serve, place on cookie sheet and reheat in oven or place on grill to heat until hot and a little crispy.
