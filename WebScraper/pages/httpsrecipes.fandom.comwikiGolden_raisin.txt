 Wikipedia Article  About Golden raisin on Wikipedia 
 Golden raisins are Thompson Seedless raisins that have been treated with sulfur dioxide and flame-dried. They are similar in appearance and taste to sultanas, although the latter come from a different variety of grape than do typical dark raisins. Golden raisins are typically encountered in the Western Hemisphere, while sultanas are seen more often in the Eastern.
