 About Offal : 
 Offal is a culinary term used to refer to the entrails and internal organs of a butchered animal. The word does not refer to a particular list of organs, but includes most internal organs other than muscles or bones. People in some cultures shy away from offal as food, while others use it as everyday food, or even in delicacies that command a high price.
 In some parts of Europe, scrotum,  brain ,  chitterlings  (pig's large intestine),  trotters  (feet),  heart , head (of pigs, calves, sheep and lamb),  kidney ,  liver , "lights" (lung),  sweetbreads  (thymus or pancreas), fries (testicles),  tongue , snout (nose),  tripe  (reticulum) and maws (stomach) from various mammals are common menu items.
