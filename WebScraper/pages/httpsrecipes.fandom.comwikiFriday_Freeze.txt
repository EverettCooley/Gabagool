 Ingredients : 
 4 scoops  orange sherbet 
 1 cup  orange juice 
 ½ cup  vodka 
 ¼ cup  rum 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients in blender at highest speed. 
 Consistency of the mix should be "semi - thick:" not so thick that a spoon would stand by itself in the mix, but not as thin as juice. 
 If the mix is too thin, add sherbet, if too thick, add equal amount of juice and alcohol. 
 Pour into glass and place in freezer for 15 minutes.
