About peanut flour : 
 Peanut flour, made from crushed, fully or partly defatted peanuts, provides a lower-fat and gluten-free solution. Peanut flour, depending on how much fat was removed, is packed with protein, providing up to 31.32g per cup. Culinary professionals use peanut flour as a thickener for soups, a flavor and aromatic enhancer in breads, pastries and main dishes.
 
 Types : 
 Light Roast Light roast 12% fat is lightest in roast, aroma and in flavor of all of the peanut flours offered. It is used in applications where the peanut flour is not needed for flavor. Light roast with 28% fat provides a light flavor and aroma to dishes. It is used in culinary dishes where only a subtle flavor is needed.
 Dark Roast The dark roast peanut flours provide a robust peanut taste and aroma. Both roasts are used when a strong peanut flour is wanted in the culinary dish. The dark roast 12% fat is less in flavor than the 28% fat.
