Description : 
 Toss with  Tofu Caesar Dressing  and  Homemade Croutons . Serves 6
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large head of  romaine lettuce , washed, dried between layers of paper towels and chilled for at least an hour 
 1 recipe of  Homemade Croutons 
 1 recipe of  vegan Caesar dressing 
 Almosen Sprinkle - optional 
 Directions : 
 As the  lettuce  is chilling, prepare the  Homemade Croutons . You can use store-bought, if you like, but they will come nowhere near tasting as good as these homemade ones do. 
 Also prepare the  Tofu Caesar Dressing 
 Now, tear the chilled  lettuce  into bite-sized pieces and place in a large salad bowl. 
 Add the croutons and toss. 
 Pour the dressing over all, and toss again. 
 At this point, you can add a generous helping of "Almosen Sprinkle" (a  parmesan cheese  substitute), if desired, and toss yet again. 
 Serve immediately.
