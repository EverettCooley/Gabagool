 About Sun-dried tomatoes : 
 Sun dried tomatoes have been sliced crosswise or halved, then dried in the sun to develop their intense, sweet-tart flavor and pleasantly chewy texture. They are available dry or packed in olive oil, sometimes with herbs and spices. The dry type should be soaked in liquid before use.
