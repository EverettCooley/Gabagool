About Cinnamon oil : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Cinnamon oil on Wikipedia 
 Its flavour is due to an aromatic essential oil which it contains to the extent of from 0.5 to 1%. This oil is prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in sea-water, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the characteristic odour of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste. The pungent taste and scent come from cinnamic aldehyde or cinnamaldehyde and, by the absorption of oxygen as it ages, it darkens in colour and develops resinous compounds. Chemical components of the essential oil include eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, beta-caryophyllene, linalool and methyl chavicol.
