 Ingredients : 
 2 cups fresh  bread crumbs 
 1 teaspoon dried herbs, such as  thyme ,  tarragon ,  rosemary  (optional) 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 500 g. boneless, skinless  chicken breasts 
 ¼ cup  vinaigrette , or  black olive  paste 
 oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 You can make bread crumbs at home by whirring the fresh bread in the food processor. 
 Season with the herbs, if using, and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Place the  chicken  breasts on a cutting board, and cut the  chicken  into strips about 2 inches long and ½ inch wide. 
 Place the  chicken  in a bowl. 
 Pour the vinaigrette over the  chicken  pieces. 
 With your hands, rub the vinaigrette into the  chicken  to make the crumbs stick to the  chicken . 
 Sprinkle the seasoned bread crumbs over the pieces and toss to coat. 
 The coating won't be evenly distributed but it really doesn't matter. 
 Heat enough  oil  just to cover the base of the pan over medium heat until shimmering. 
 Add the  chicken  pieces and sauté, without moving them, until the crumbs look golden, about 1 minute. 
 With tongs, turn the pieces over and sauté the second side until golden, about 3 minutes. 
 Reduce the heat to low and continue to sauté, turning the pieces frequently, until the  chicken  is cooked through, about 10 minutes longer.
