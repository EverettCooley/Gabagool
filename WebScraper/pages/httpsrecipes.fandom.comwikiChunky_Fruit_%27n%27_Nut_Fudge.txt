Chunky Fruit 'n' Nut Fudge
From Country Woman
 Variations on this fudge are endless, but this recipe is my favorite.
Besides five types of chips, it includes everything from dried fruit to
nuts. Every bite is packed with flavor and crunch.
 INGREDIENTS
1 package (11 ounces) dried cherries
 1 cup dried cranberries
 1-1/2 teaspoons plus 3/4 cup butter, softened, divided
 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk

 DIRECTIONS
In a large bowl, combine cherries and cranberries. Add enough warm water
to cover; set aside. Line a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. pan with foil and
grease the foil with 1-1/2 teaspoons butter; set aside.
In a large heavy saucepan, melt remaining butter. Stir in the milk,
chips and cream. Cook and stir over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until
chips are melted and mixture is smooth and blended (mixture will first
appear separated, but continue stirring until fully blended). Remove
from the heat; stir in marshmallow creme and extract.
Drain cherries and cranberries; pat dry with paper towels. Stir the
fruit, cashews and chocolate chunks into chocolate mixture. Spread into
prepared pan. Let stand at room temperature until set.
Using foil, lift fudge out of pan. Discard foil; cut fudge into
1-in. squares. Yield: 6-3/4 pounds.
