 Description : 
 Similar to the original  sinangag  or fried rice, this red-hot rice dish is made with real spices and is great with other main dishes. Chili powder and garlic powder rarely work for this, too while it also keeps a tangy aroma with the rice.

 2 cups  water 
 1 cup uncooked  rice , white only 
 ¼ cup chopped  green onions 
 2 fresh red  chiles , chopped and seeded if desired 
 1 tablespoon chopped, fresh  cilantro 
 1 tablespoon  margarine 
 1 teaspoon minced fresh  ginger 
 ¾ teaspoon  salt 
 2 teaspoons black pepper 
 ⅛ teaspoon  ground turmeric 
 1 to 2 teaspoons fresh  lime juice 
 chopped, roasted  peanuts  for garnishing, optional 
 red pepper flakes  for garnishing, optional 
 Directions : 
 Combine  water ,  rice ,  onions ,  chiles ,  cilantro ,  margarine ,  ginger ,  salt , black pepper, and  turmeric  in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil; stir once or twice. 
 Reduce heat; cover and simmer 15 minutes or until  rice  is tender and liquid is absorbed. 
 Mix with  lime juice ; then fluff with fork. 
 Garnish with  peanuts  and  pepper  flakes. Serve warm and plain but pair this spice-based rice dish with other main dishes
