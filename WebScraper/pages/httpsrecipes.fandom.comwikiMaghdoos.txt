 Description : 
 Pickled Eggplant with Chile Pepper. I consulted some Middle Eastern cookbooks containing pickling recipes, and this was the best incarnation of maghdoos that I could come up with. Apparently, there are many, many variations on this pickle in the Middle East. Note: This recipe requires advance preparation.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds very small, thin  eggplants , washed and left unpeeled 
 salted  water 
 4 cloves  garlic , finely chopped 
 3 small dried  red chile  pods, such as piquin or de arbol, crushed 
 Â¼ cup minced  celery 
 3 cups  water 
 4 tablespoons  salt 
 2 cups  white wine vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Make small but deep incisions in each  eggplant . 
 In a pot, poach them in boiling, salted  water  for 5 to 10 minutes until slightly softened. 
 Drain well. 
 In a small bowl, combine the  garlic , crushed  chile , and  celery . 
 Stuff the incisions with this mixture. 
 Arrange the  eggplants  in a glass bowl. 
 In a large jar, combine the  water ,  salt , and  vinegar , shake well, and pour it over the  eggplants . 
 Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least four days. 
 To serve, cut into thick slices. This recipe will last for months in the refrigerator.
