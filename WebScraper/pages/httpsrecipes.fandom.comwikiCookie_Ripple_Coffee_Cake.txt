Cookie Ripple Coffee Cake 
 24 Oreo cookies coarsely chopped 
1/4 butter melted 
One package yellow pound cake mix 
4 teaspoons milk 
1/3 cup flour 
1/3 semisweet chocolate chips (maybe a little more) 
1 cup powdered sugar 
 Mix chopped cookies with flour and butter (this is so they don't 
settle to the bottom of the cake). Stir in Chocolate chips and set 
aside. Prepare cake mix according to package directions (use amounts of 
milk, water and eggs it says to on the box). Pour half the batter into 
a greased Bundt pan. Sprinkle 2 cups of cookie mixture evenly over 
batter. Top with remaining batter and then cookie mixture - pressing 
cookies gently into batter. Bake at 350 degrees for about one hour 
(test it first). Cool in pan for a couple of minutes and then invert 
cake and let cool completely. Mix powdered sugar and milk and drizzle 
over cake
