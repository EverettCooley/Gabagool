 About Apple juice : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Apple juice on Wikipedia 
 Apple juice (sometimes abbreviated AJ) is the fruit juice product originally manufactured from the pressing of apples. In the United States (and parts of Canada), juice produced from apples under some circumstances is referred to as cider rather than as apple juice. Outside of North America, cider refers exclusively to a fermented drink (an alcoholic beverage), so the same distinction is not made. 
 
 Serving Suggestions : 
 Heat apple juice in sauce pan with  cinnamon  and whole  cloves  (optional) for a cold weather treat. Strain spices from juice before drinking. 
 Blend apple juice with mashed fresh fruit,  yogurt , and chopped  ice  to make a fruit smoothie.
