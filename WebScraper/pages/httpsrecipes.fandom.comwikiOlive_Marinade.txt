 Description : 
 This tangy, rich marinade starts with real olives, olive oil, and herbs and keeps a mild, light flavor. Bay leaves occasionally work for this, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 oz. canned, black pitted olives, drained, then chopped if desired 
 ¼ cup olive oil 
 2 tbsp. chopped oregano and basil  or  (5 tbsp. Italian seasoning) 
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar 
 ½ tsp. red pepper flakes 
 ¼ tsp. salt 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a container with a tight, fitting lid. 
 Cover, then shake to coat. Pour, spoon, or funnel contents into a fresh container. 
 Refrigerate 2 hours, then serve at room temperature.
