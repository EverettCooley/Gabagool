American Fare potato chips are the generic brand of potato chips sold in K-Mart stores.
 Reviewers at snack website  taquitos.net  were not particularly impressed with these chips, declaring them "a bit bland in the taste department". While the bag contained many large, unbroken and crisp chips, "the bite just didn't feel right".
