Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Boil

A moist-heat cooking method in which ingredients are cooked in water or other liquid heated to approximately 212 degrees F. (the boiling point of water). At the boiling point large bubbles will steadily break the surface of the liquid. The high temperature of boiling can make foods tough and the turbulence of the liquid can cause fragile ingredients to fall apart, so dishes like stews are generally cooked at a simmer, and ingredients like fish and fruit are poached.
