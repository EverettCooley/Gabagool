 Many dishes can be enhanced by adding a sauce. Sauces can also serve to fill out left over dishes that would not be quite enough on their own, or to hide the fact that they are left overs. 
 Of course there are sauces that are staple in Dutch cooking: cauliflower sauce, see  Bloemkoolsaus , tomato sauce, see  Tomato sauce  and cheese sauce (Kaassaus).
