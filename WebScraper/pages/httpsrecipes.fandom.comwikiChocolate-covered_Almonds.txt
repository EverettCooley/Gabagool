 Health Tips : 
 A one-and-a-half ounce handful of almonds is a leading source of vitamin E and magnesium and offers protein, fiber, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron. Almonds are the leading source of monounsaturated fat among America's most consumed nuts. Of the 14 grams of total fat found in one ounce of almonds, about 64 percent is monounsaturated. This "good" fat plays a role in helping almonds lower harmful cholesterol just as effectively as expensive drugs, according to a recent study published by the American Heart Association.
 
 Ingredients : 
 almonds 
 sugar 
 cocoa butter 
 whole  milk 
 chocolate liquor 
 lecithin  (added as an emulsifier) 
 vanillin  (an artificial flavoring) 
 confectioner's glaze 
 Directions : 
 Mix almonds, sugar, water in a heavy saucepan over medium high heat for about 5 minutes until mixture has a sandy texture and coats the almonds. (While stirring, push mixture up the sides to make sugar crystallize.) 
 Spread almonds on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and freeze. 
 Warm chocolate until just melted (about 88 °F). 
 Put almonds into a bowl and pour ½ of the chocolate in and mix vigorously to keep almonds from clumping together. 
 Add the rest of the chocolate and continue to stir until almonds are well coated. Roll almonds in powdered sugar to coat.
