Description : 
 Ibos (Visayan) or suman (Tagalog) is basically malagkit ( sticky rice ) wrapped in either  banana  leaves or  coconut  leaves.
 
       Suman     
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups of malagkit (sticky or sweet)  rice 
 a can of  coconut milk 
 fresh ginger  or maybe  anise seeds  or  anise extract 
 sugar 
 Directions : 
 Cook malagkit just like you cook  rice  in your  rice  cooker but instead of using  water , use  coconut milk  - about two-thirds of the can, when cooking malagkit, you have to use a little bit less of liquid than cooking regular  rice . 
 we don't use ginger.. we use langka/// 
 If you don't have  ginger , add a tablespoon or two of  anise extract  or if you have the seeds, a sprinkle will do. 
 Once the  rice  is cooked, you can wrap them in the  banana  leaves (or foil) like you wrap lumpia. 
 Take about two tablespoons full of the  rice , put them on top of your  banana  leaf sheet that you have cut into square pieces about 6 inches by 6 inches or so, then roll to make a log, then twist both ends and tuck under the log. 
 Note: in order for your  banana  leaf not to tear, you have to run the leaf over a flame. 
 You also need to wipe the leaf with a piece of damp cloth. 
 Place the  rice  on top of the darker side of the leaf (this side doesn't have that whitish powdery stuff that covers the underside of the  banana  leaf). 
 Now, after you finished wrapping your  rice , put them in a casserole or a large sauce pan, then boil it, covered, again using  coconut milk  just enough to cover your pile (use the remaining  coconut milk  diluted with  water ). 
 I remember my mother used to cook the wrapped malagkit overnight but i suppose you can finish this in one hour just how i did the batch above - or until the liquid evaporates. 
 Serve rolled in  sugar  or as a side dish for ripe manila mangoes.
