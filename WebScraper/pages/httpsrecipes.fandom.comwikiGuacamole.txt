 Ingredients : 
 3  avocados 
 2 tablespoons  pico de gallo 
 juice of ½  lime 
 1 chopped  jalapeño   or  2 tablespoons crushed red pepper  or  1 tablespoon  cayenne pepper 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 4 teaspoon  olive oil 
 1½ teaspoon chopped  garlic 
 ½ teaspoon ground  black pepper 
 1 minced  jalapeño   or  2 minced  serrano chiles   or  2 tablespoon minced any  chile pepper  (adjust for spiciness) 
 cilantro  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Pit the avocados. 
 Score avocado without cutting through the skin. 
 Scoop out one avocado with a large spoon and place in mixing bowl. Add the lime juice and stir to evenly coat the avocados. 
 Stir in the pico de gallo, garlic, oil, jalapeño, salt, red pepper, and black pepper, mashing and tossing the avocado pieces until thoroughly mixed. 
 Then scoop out the other avocados and gently mix and toss in the larger pieces. The guacamole is the right consistency when more large pieces than mashed parts remain. Garnish with a sprig of cilantro. 
 Place avocado pit back into bowl. The pit keeps the guacamole fresh when at room temperature and in the kitchen!.
