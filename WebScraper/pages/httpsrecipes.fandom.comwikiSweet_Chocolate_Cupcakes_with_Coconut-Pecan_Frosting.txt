Sweet Chocolate Cupcakes with Coconut-Pecan Frosting
 
Sweet Chocolate Cupcakes
 2 bars (1.5 ounces each) Dark Chocolate, finely
chopped
1/4 cup water
1 1/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, separated and at room temperature
1/4 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
 Coconut-Pecan Frosting
 3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup confectionary sugar
3/4 cup pecans, toasted* and coarsely chopped
3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut
 
 To toast pecans, spread nuts in a single layer in a 
 shallow baking pan. Bake in a 350ï¿½F oven for 5-10
minutes or until light golden brown, watching
carefully and stirring once or twice so nuts do not
burn. Cool completely before using.
 Make Cupcakes:
Position racks in center of oven. Heat oven to 350.
 Line muffin cups with paper liners or grease muffin
cups and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons flour, tapping
out excess.
 Place chocolate and 1/4 cup water in microwavable
bowl. Heat on HIGH for about 1 minute. Let stand in
microwave 30 seconds. Stir until smooth; set aside.
 Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and
1/4 teaspoon salt in medium bowl; set aside. In small
bowl, whisk together egg whites, buttermilk and 1/2
teaspoon vanilla extract until blended.
 In medium bowl, beat 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup
granulated sugar with electric mixer at medium speed
for about 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add
egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add melted
chocolate mixture. Reduce speed to low and beat in
half flour mixture until just blended. Add egg white
mixture. Stir in remaining flour mixture.
 Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake for 18
to 22 minutes, or until tops are set and tester
inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cupcakes in
pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cupcakes
from pans and cool completely on wire rack.
 Make Frosting:
Combine 3 tablespoons water and 1/2 cup granulated
sugar in medium saucepot over medium heat, stirring
constantly. Occasionally brush down sides of pan with
wet pastry brush until sugar is dissolved.
 Increase heat to medium-high and cook without stirring
for 4 to 6 minutes or until syrup turns to a rich
amber caramel color. Immediately remove saucepot from
heat and slowly stir in evaporated milk. Be careful;
mixture will quickly bubble up.
 Return saucepot to heat. Heat to a boil. Cook mixture
over medium heat until reduced to about 2/3 cup; about
8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in 1/2
teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Pour into
separate bowl. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
 Add 6 tablespoons butter to bowl. Beat with electric
mixer at medium-high speed until mixture is blended.
Add confectioners' sugar and beat until mixture is
smooth. Stir in pecans and coconut.
 Assemble Cupcakes:
Using small angled spatula, spread frosting in even
layer over cupcakes. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
