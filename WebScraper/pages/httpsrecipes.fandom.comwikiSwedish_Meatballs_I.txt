 Original recipe 
 Yield: 12 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1  egg 
 ½ cup  low-fat (1%) milk 
 2 slices whole wheat  bread , lightly toasted and made into coarse crumbs 
 ½ small  onion , minced 
 2 tablespoon minced fresh  parsley 
 ½ teaspoon  salt  (optional) 
 ¼ teaspoon ground  allspice 
 ¼ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 1 pound ground skinless  turkey  breast 
 ½ pound lean  ground pork 
 3 tablespoons  all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons  vegetable oil  
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, whisk the egg with the milk and bread crumbs; let stand for 5 minutes. 
 Add the onion, parsley, salt, allspice, and nutmeg; blend well. 
 Add the meats and stir with a fork until well blended. 
 Cover and chill for at least 30 minutes. 
 Sprinkle with flour on a piece of waxed paper and place next to the meat bowl. 
 Shape the meat into 48 meatballs, about 1 tablespoon each. 
 Dip each meatball lightly in the flour and place on a baking sheet. 
 Set aside. 
 In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil. 
 Add half the meatballs and cook until browned all over, 5 minutes. 
 Cover and cook the meatballs until the meat is no longer pink, 20 – 25 minutes, turning occasionally (remaining meatballs should be refrigerated). 
 Transfer the cooked meatballs to a bowl, cover, and keep warm. 
 Remove any small meat pieces from the skillet. 
 Repeat step 3 with the remaining meatballs.
