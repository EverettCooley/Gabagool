 Description : 
 In all Punjabi households - even if you have run out of lots of ingredients to make dinner with - there is always a bare minumum of stuff in the cupboard that can be used to knock something up in an emergency. And that bare minimum is  potatoes  and  onions  - and preferably also some green chillie  peppers  - preferably the  long green  ones that you can get in any Asian grocer shop - and they keep for ages in the fridge too. (Well a week or so at least). Here's what you'll need to make this fine-tasting accompaniment to a main meal - or indeed can be eaten alone as a sort of midnight snack if you're that way inclined
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2  long green  chillie  peppers 
 Half an  Onion 
 1 and a half small  new potatoes  - or one small one and one even smaller one 
 Spices:
 
 1heaped teaspoons of  garam masala , half heaped of ground coriander, half tsp  salt , quarter tsp haldi ( turmeric ) 
 Pinch of  Onion  seed (optional) and pinch of  cumin  seed (also optional - but very tasty) 
 Some  coriander leaf  if you have any (I used frozen chopped leaf) 
 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Just chop the  Onion  sort of finely - and fry it in frying pan in a little  vegetable oil . When the  onions  are soft throw in the pinches of  Onion  and  cumin  seeds if you are using them. Fry it all about for a bit
 
       Fry onions until soft     
         Add the onion and cumin seeds     
 Whilst the  Onion  pan is going - boil or microwave the  potatoes  (in their skins if you are using  new potatoes ) until they are soft - should only take 3.5 mins in microwave if using small ones. And also carefully cut a slit in the green chillie  peppers  that you will eventually stuff the mixture into
 
         Microwave the potatoes     
         Slit the chillies     
 When the  potatoes  are soft - let them cool a bit - and then dice them up. Add them to the frying pan and add all the spices and stir it around until the spices have infused into the mixture of  potatoes  and  onions  - it should only take say 5 minutes or so. Then empty the contents of the frying pan into a small bowl and mash up the  Potato  and  Onion  mixture with a fork until it is not so lumpy as before
 
         Chop up the cooked popatoe     
         Mush up the mixture     
 Then stuff all the mushed up mixture into the chillie  peppers  through the slits you created earlier - pack it all in real tight - but don't overfill. If you have any surplus mixture just eat it there and then. (Go on!) Then place the stuffed chillies into a frying pan with some more hot  vegetable oil  and fry for around 15 mins - turning over occasionally on all sides
 
         Stuff the chillies     
         Fry the sruffed chillies for 15 mins     
 The outer skin of the chillies should be blistered and charred after a while - then transfer them to a baking tray and bake in a preheated oven (say 170 celcius) for a further 20 mins or so - this will soften the chillie  peppers  some more
 
         Shouls be blistered in all sides     
         Stick in preheated over for another 20 mins     
 Then - just serve up and eat - like I said earlieryou can eat this is a side to another main dish
