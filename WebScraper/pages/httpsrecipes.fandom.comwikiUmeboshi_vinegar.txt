 Produced from a plum, this red seasoning is made from the juices created by the pickling of  ume  plums . Tart and salty in flavor,  ume  plum vinegar is used as both a seasoning and an ingredient for beverages, salad dressings, steamed vegetables, rice dishes, dips, sauces, and food spreads. The  ume  plum is a Japanese fruit used most often as a condiment, which is referred to as  umeboshi  plums. However, the  ume  plum vinegar and  umeboshi  vinegar are different in flavor and ingredients. The  umeboshi  vinegar has more of the brine or pickled flavor, resulting in a saltier-tasting vinegar. As a substitute for  ume  plum vinegar, use red-wine vinegar.
