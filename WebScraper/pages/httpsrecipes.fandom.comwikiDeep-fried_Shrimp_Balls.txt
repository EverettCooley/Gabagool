 0.5 kg / 1 lb raw  shrimp 
 ¼ cup / 50 g peeled  water chestnuts 
 2½ tablespoons  glutinous rice powder 
 1  egg 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  Chinese rice wine  (or  sherry ) 
 cooking  oil  for deep frying 
 Dip : 
 2 tablespoons  tomato sauce 
 salt  and  Sichuan pepper 
 Directions : 
 Shell the  shrimp , dry them well and marinate with  salt  for 3 – 5 minutes. 
 Chop the  shrimp  into  rice   grain  sized pieces. 
 Finely chop the  water chestnuts  and mix them with the  shrimp ,  egg ,  glutinous rice  powder,  rice wine  and blend well. 
 Heat the  oil  in a deep-fryer. 
 Before it gets too hot, take a handful of the  shrimp  mixture and squeeze it through your fist between the thumb and forefinger to form a ball about the size of a walnut. 
 Scoop it off with a wet spoon and dip it into the  oil . 
 You should be able to make about 20 balls. 
 Fry for about 2 minutes. 
 Stir to separate them and when they start to turn golden, scoop them out and drain.
