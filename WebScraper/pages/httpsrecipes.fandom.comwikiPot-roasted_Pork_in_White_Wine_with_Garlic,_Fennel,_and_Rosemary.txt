 6 servings. 
 Ingredients : 
 3 lb  pork loin , off the bone and skin removed 
 1 tbsp  fennel seeds 
 2 – 3 dabs of  butter 
 olive oil 
 8 cloves  garlic 
 handful fresh  rosemary 
 4  bay leaves  (depending on size) 
 1  fennel  bulb, sliced 
 ½ bottle  chardonnay  wine 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 400°F. 
 Tie up your pork so it doesn't dry out. 
 Season generously with salt and pepper and roll meat to cover in fennel seeds. 
 In a roasting or casserole pan/dish sauté the meat in a little butter and olive oil and brown on all sides. 
 Add in the garlic, herbs, fennel, and wine, then cover foil or parchment paper. 
 Cook till the internal temp of the meat is 150°F. 
 Pork loin off the bone cooks very quickly so watch it. 
 Then let the meat rest on a plate while you make the sauce. 
 Sauce : 
 Add the rest of the butter and scrape off the goodies from the bottom of the pan. 
 Remove any large bits.
