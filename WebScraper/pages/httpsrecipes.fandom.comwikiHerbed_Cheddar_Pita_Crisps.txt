 Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. 
 Makes about ¾ pound. 
 Ingredients : 
 6 x 7-inch  pita  pockets, cut into 1½-inch pieces and separated 
 1 teaspoon crumbled dried  sage 
 1 teaspoon dried  thyme , crumbled 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 1½ cups grated sharp  Cheddar  (about 6 ounces) 
 Directions : 
 Arrange the pita pieces close together, rough sides up, on 2 large baking sheets. 
 In a small bowl combine well the  sage , the  thyme , the  salt , and the  pepper 
 Sprinkle the mixture over the pita pieces, and scatter the  Cheddar  on top. 
 Bake the crisps in a preheated 375°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden. 
 Notes : 
 Assemble everything ahead of time, but don't bake the crisps until shortly before serving them so they're nice and crisp. They're especially good warm. To reheat them, I'd probably warm them up in the oven.
