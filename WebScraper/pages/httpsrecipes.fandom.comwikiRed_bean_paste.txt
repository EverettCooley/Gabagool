 About red bean paste : 
 Red bean paste  or "Azuki bean paste" is a sweet, dark red bean paste originating from China. It is used in Chinese cuisine, Japanese confectionery, and Korean cuisine. It is prepared by boiling and mashing azuki beans and then sweetening the paste with sugar or honey. The husk of the beans may be removed by sieving before sweetening, which leads to a smoother and more homogeneous paste.
 
 Tsubuan (粒餡), whole red beans boiled with sugar but otherwise untreated 
 Tsubushian (潰し餡), where the beans are mashed after boiling 
 Koshian (漉し餡), which has been passed through a sieve to remove bean skins; the most common type 
 Sarashian (晒し餡), which has been dried and reconstituted with water
