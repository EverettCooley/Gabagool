 Description : 
 This was a recipe that I found somewhere online. It was rather tasty. I did not read well and subesquently roasted the cashews. My guys are allergic to corn so I will be using arrowroot the next time that I make. I will feel like I struck gold if it tastes more like cheese the next time.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 c. milk 
 1 jar (4oz) pimientos 
 1 1/2 t. salt 
 1/2 t. onion powder 
 3 heaping T. nutritional yeast flakes 
 1/4 t. garlic or garlic powder 
 2 level T. cornstarch 
 1/4 c. raw cashews 
 1 T lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 In a blender or food processor, add cashews, pimentos, and milk and blend until smooth. 
 Add the remaining ingredients and blend until well mixed.
