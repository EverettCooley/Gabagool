      Chutney     
 A pungent relish made of fruits, spices, and herbs.
 Chutney  (चटनी in Hindi, Nepali and similar in other North Indian languages) refers to spiced East Indian-style relishes or pickles served as condiments.
 In genuine Indian cuisine, a chutney is usually a fresh salsa-like preparation, or sometimes a preparation cooked for prompt consumption. Fermented sour, spicy and often somewhat salty pickles are also served in this role, but they are called अचार (transliterated  achar  or  achaar ). The chutney-achar distinction tends to be lost in  Anglo-Indian  cuisine where 'chutney' translates into less intensely spiced preserves that are just seldom sour, but often highly sweetened.
