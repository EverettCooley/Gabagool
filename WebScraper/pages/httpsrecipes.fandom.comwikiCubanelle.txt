 Wikipedia Article  About Cubanelle on Wikipedia 
 The Cubanelle or Cuban pepper is a variety of sweet pepper of the species Capsicum annuum. When unripe, it is light yellowish-green in color, but will turn bright red if allowed to ripen. Compared to bell peppers it has thinner flesh, is longer, and has a slightly more wrinkled appearance. It is used extensively in Puerto Rico's cuisine.
 Cubanelle peppers are used in the U.S. to replace Poblano peppers. Most of the cubanelle pepper imports come from the Dominican Republic (where it's called aj√≠ cubanela), which has been -of late- the main exporter of this cultivar.
