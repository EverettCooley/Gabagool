Ingredients : 
 1 cup Wishbone Italian dressing (other brands not as good) 
 ⅓ cup  soy sauce  (prefer Kimlan or Kikkoman) 
 juice of one  lime 
 1 Tablespoon Bolner's Fiesta brand fajita seasoning (from San Antonio) 
 1½ teaspoons seasoned  meat tenderizer  (McCormick's) 
 1 teaspoon  crushed red pepper  (pizza flakes) 
 1 ounce  honey 
 1 teaspoon minced  garlic  (jar is OK) 
 2 – 3 dashes Louisiana  hot sauce 
 handful of fresh  cilantro , mostly leaves 
 Directions : 
 Blend all ingredients in food processor and marinate  chicken  breasts at least several hours or preferably overnight. I pound boneless  chicken  breasts to even thickness and tenderize meat by punching small holes. 
 Grill about 8 – 10 minutes being careful not to overcook and toughen meat. 
 Warm extra marinade on the side for sauce or dipping.
