 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Two cups uncooked  white rice 
 1 can  Onion  soup 
 1 can of  beer 
 two slices of  Bacon , cut in small pieces. Trim off some of the fat, if excessive. 
 1 large white  Onion , peeled of its outer coats 
 1 teaspoonful of  salt 
 1 cup Spanish  red peppers  (pimientos morrones) 
 1 cup sweet  Peas  (or  Peas  and  carrots ) 
 Directions : 
 The  rice  should be cooked in a pot just deep enough to allow for its doubling in size during the process. 
 Fry the  Bacon  over medium heat in the pot where you will cook the  rice , until most of the grease has become #liquid. Stir occasionally to keep the  Bacon  from sticking to the pot. 
 Add the  beer  and the  Onion  soup. Carefully add the  rice  and the  salt , stir and set to medium heat, uncovered, until the liquid evaporates. Do not try to speed up the process by using more heat, since this may cause scorching of the  rice  and a good portion of it may stick to the bottom of the pot. 
 When the liquid has evaporated (about ten minutes), use a ladle to fold the  rice  so that the  rice  from the bottom now lies on top. It normally takes about four scoops to go around the whole pot. Place the  Onion  on top of the  rice , REDUCE the heat to LOW, and cover the  rice . The  rice  should cook for ten to fifteen minutes, or until tender. 
 Decorate with the Spanish  red peppers  and the sweet  Peas  (and  carrots ) when serving. 
 Leftovers may be warmed in a microwave oven with a few drops of  water  added. 
 Try it a side dish for a  Steak  or roast!
