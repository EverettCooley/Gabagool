Ingredients : 
 1 cup white  sugar 
 1 cup  light karo syrup 
 1½ cups  peanut butter 
 6 cups Special K cereal 
 12 oz  chocolate chips 
 6 oz  butterscotch chips 
 Directions : 
 Combine sugar and karo syrup in a stock pan and bring to a rolling boil (the point when it “just” starts to boil or the bars will be hard and not soft and chewy). 
 Stir in the peanut butter (if you spray your measuring cups with PAM the peanut butter comes out easier and won't stick). 
 Mix well and then fold in the Special K cereal. 
 Spread cereal mixture in a 13x9 inch pan (grease bottom only – or spray with PAM). 
 Melt the chips together (in a double-boiler or in the microwave) and then spread on top. 
 Let set and then cut. 
 Enjoy!
