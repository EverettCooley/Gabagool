Holiday Bread Pudding
 2 slightly beaten eggs
2 1/4 cups Sprite
3/4 cup powdered milk
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 slices day-old white bread, cut into 1 inch pieces
1/3 cup raisins
 In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, Sprite, milk, brown sugar, vanilla and salt; stir the bread pieces and raisins. Let stand 5 minutes. Turn the mixture into an ungreased 8x1 1/2 inch round baking dish. Place the dish in a 13x9x2 inch baking pan. Carefully pour some hot water into the larger pan to a depth of 1 inch. Bake uncovered in 350 degree oven about 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
