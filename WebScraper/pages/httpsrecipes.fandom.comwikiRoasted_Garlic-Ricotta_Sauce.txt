 Alfredo Alternative
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin  olive oil 
 1/3 cup chopped roasted  garlic 
 1/4 cup chopped roasted shallots 
 1/2 cup  white wine 
 3 cups  vegetable stock 
 3 tablespoons  cornstarch  mixed with 3 tablespoons  water 
 1/2 cup fat-free  ricotta cheese 
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped fresh  basil 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh  oregano 
 1/2 teaspoon  sea salt 
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and add the  olive oil  to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Stir in the roasted  garlic  and shallots and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until reduced and the pan is almost dry, about 3 to 5 minutes, to concentrate the flavors of the sauce. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
 
 Mix in the  cornstarch  mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
 
 Place the  ricotta cheese  and about 1/3 cup of the  garlic  mixture into a blender. With the blender on, slowly pour in the remaining sauce through the opening in the blender lid; the sauce will thicken.
 
 Transfer the sauce back into the saucepan and stir in the  basil ,  oregano ,  salt  and  pepper .
 
 Use the sauce immediately, or cool quickly by setting in a bowl of  ice  and  water . Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or freeze for about 1 month.
