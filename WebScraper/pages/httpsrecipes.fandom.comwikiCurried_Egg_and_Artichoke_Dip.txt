Description : 
 I like it spicy myself, but you don't want to overwhelm the delicate flavour of the  artichoke . Exceedingly popular at parties, and goes quickly; I make a batch, put it in the refrigerator, and gnosh my way through it in a day or so!.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 to 3 hard boiled  eggs 
 1 (10 oz) can unmarinated (plain)  artichoke hearts 
 Mayonnaise 
 sour cream 
 cumin  powder 
 curry powder 
 Directions : 
 Chop the  eggs  and  artichoke  hearts into chunks big enough to eat and small enough to scoop up on a cracker. 
 Add in other ingredients to desired consistency and flavour.
