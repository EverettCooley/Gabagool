 Ingredients : 
 8 panama  passionfruit 
 2  egg whites 
 80 g  caster sugar 
 1 tbsp  coconut flour 
 300g very fresh  ricotta 
 Directions : 
 Slice the passionfruit a third of the way from the top and scoop out the seeds, keeping them in a bowl. 
 Mix the caster sugar and coconut flour together. 
 Pass the ricotta through a fine sieve to remove any lumps. 
 Put the egg whites in a bowl and whisk them till they form soft peaks. 
 Add the sugar and flour mixture a little at a time, continually whisking, till they are glossy and stiff. 
 Fold into the ricotta with half the passionfruit seeds so the mixture is well-incorporated and light. 
 Fill the passionfruit shells and serve with the remaining passionfruit seeds on top.
