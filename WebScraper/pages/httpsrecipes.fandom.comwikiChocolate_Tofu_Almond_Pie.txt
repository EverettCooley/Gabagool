 6 tbsp soy  margarine , slightly softened, (I use regular Pareve  margarine ) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Spread the  slivered almonds  on a baking sheet and place in the oven. 
 Toast them for 5 to 10 minutes, until they color lightly, shaking the pan and watching them carefully so they don't burn. 
 Set aside to cool. 
 In food processor or blender on high speed, puree the  tofu  until smooth. 
 Add the  brown sugar  and blend until thoroughly combined. 
 Add the  cocoa  and  vanilla  and continue to blend until the mixture is smooth. 
 Scrape down the sides of the blender if necessary. 
 Pour the mixture into the crust and sprinkle the  almond  slivers evenly on top. 
 Cover and chill for at least 2 hours or up to 24. 
 Graham cracker pie crust : 
 Process the graham crackers in food processor, until finely ground. 
 Add the  margarine  an pulse until the mixture reaches the consistency of coarse crumbs. 
 Pat the layer into a thick layer in bottom of 9 inch pie pan.
