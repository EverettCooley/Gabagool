Description : 
 Eggplant ratatouille
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  red  or  green bell peppers 
 1 medium  eggplant 
 2  tomatoes  (if they are over ripe, make cross marks on the bottom, put them in boiling  water  for 1 – 2 minutes, remove, drain, peel, remove the seeds and chop. if you want to be a little fancier with really good  tomatoes  do the same thing. This is called concasse) 
 1  onion 
 ½ tablespoon of  paprika 
 1 teaspoon  cayenne 
 1 teaspoon spice blend (I used a blend of  cumin ,  turmeric  and caraway) 
 lots of  olive oil 
 salt  and  pepper 
 optional herbs:  flat leaf parsley ,  coriander leaf  ( cilantro ) or  fenugreek leaves 
 Directions : 
 Some cooks throw everything in the pot and cook on medium/low for 30 – 40 minutes. 
 Some cooks throw everything into a ceramic vessel and bake covered in the oven for 1 hour 350°F 
 Some cooks saute the  onions  first until caramelized, add the  eggplant  plus more  olive oil , and then the remaining ingredients and cook on medium/low heat for 30 – 40 minutes.
