 Ethiopian vegetarian dishes have gained praise internationally as some of the best in the world. This is due partly because of the religious customs of the area where fasting is an important tradition. As a result, there is a very large selection of strictly vegetarian dishes, for those who may be looking for such. Ethiopian vegetarian dishes typically consist of local vegetables, spices, and seasonings along with servings of injera, a type of flat bread which is very common to the area.
