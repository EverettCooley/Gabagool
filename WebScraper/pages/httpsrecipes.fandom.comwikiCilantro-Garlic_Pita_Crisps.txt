 Description : 
 This tangy version of the pita crisps is made and packed with real herbs and olive oil and is great with other appetizers or side dishes.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ bunch fresh cilantro 
 ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 2 garlic cloves, crushed 
 6 pita breads 
 chopped fresh chives 
 3 teaspoons salt, rock, iodized, or sea only 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 350° F. Cut each pita bread round horizontally in half. 
 Cut each round into 6 wedges. Place pita wedges on 2 rimmed baking sheets; just drizzle with cilantro-garlic oil and salt and toss gently to coat. 
 Arrange pita wedges in a single layer; bake 5 minutes. 
 Sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves and bake until pita wedges are crisp and golden, about 5 minutes longer; cool. Serve warm and plain or with other side dishes or appetizers. Dip into a flavor of choice on baked pita crisps, if desired.
