 About Caesar's mushroom : 
 Amanita caesarea, commonly known in English as Caesar's Mushroom, is a highly regarded edible mushroom in the genus Amanita, native to southern Europe  and North Africa. It has a distinctive orange cap, yellow gills and stem. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India. It was known to and valued by the Ancient Romans, who called it  Boletus , a name now applied to a very different type of fungus.
 This mushroom is highly prized, and is a common sight in the markets of Italy, southern France, and Spain. However, many mycologists warn inexperienced gatherers against seeking it out as it can be easily confused with other deadly members of the Amanita genus, for example  Amanita muscaria  or  Amanita phalloides .
