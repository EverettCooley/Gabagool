 1 cup  Oats 
 2 cups  water 
 pinch  sea salt 
 1/2 cup tompsonâ€™s  Raisins 
 pinch  cinnamon 
 sprinkle of  sucanat

 Soak whole natural  Oats  overnight. Cook for 5 minutes or until desired consistency. If you forget to presoak your  Oats , cook them for 25 minutes. The key to unburned perfect porridge is a thick heavy iron pot and keeping the stove on the lowest setting. After boiling, cover with a tight fitting lid. Cook  Raisins ,  dates  or any dried fruit or sliced  Apples  with  Oats  to soften them. You can add a mixture of powdered sesame or  sunflower seeds , mixed with  sucanat .  oatmeal  is a good health breakfast that will stay with you throughout the day. It has a light flavor that will not be overbearing to sleepy taste buds. Pennies per serving, it is a healthy alternative to Captain Crunch or Fruit Loops which is much more expensive and far less nutritious. Recipe reprinted with permission from HealthRecipes.com
