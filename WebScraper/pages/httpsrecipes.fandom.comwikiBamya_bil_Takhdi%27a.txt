Okra casserole
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 package of frozen, cut  bamya 
 2 lb of cut  lamb  meat (you may use  beef ) cut into ½-1 inch cubes 
 1 medium  onion  (fine chopped) 
 2 crushed and fine chopped cloves of  garlic 
 1 tbsp  oil  (to counteract the high fat in  lamb ) 
 2 diced  bell peppers 
 1 small can of  tomato paste 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  oil  and sauté the  onions  and  garlic  till the  onions  become translucent. 
 Drop the meat and brown it, here if you care for your diet and weight you may drain the fat other wise do not (I prefer the latter), add the contents of the paste with one can full of  water 
 Simmer until the  tomato  boils and thickens a bit drop the  okra ,  bell pepper  and simmer on low till done. 
 I always like my food to bite me back so I use a dash or  cayenne pepper  to make it hot.
