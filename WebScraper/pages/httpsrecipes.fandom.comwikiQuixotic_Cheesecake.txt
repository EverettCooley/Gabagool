 Ingredients : 
 Nut Crust 
 5 Tbs. softened  butter 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 1/2 cup  granulated sugar 
 2 cups untoasted  walnuts 
 Cheesecake Filling 
 1 large  Eggplant  (about 1 1/2 lb.) 
 4 large  eggs 
 3/4 tsp.  salt 
 1 cup  granulated sugar 
 1 cup  semi-sweet chocolate  chips 
 1 8-oz. pkg.  cream cheese 
 2 tsp.  vanilla extract 
 Sauce 
 Juice of 3  oranges  and 2  lemons 
 1/2 cup  granulated sugar 
 2 Tbs.  butter 
 3/4 tsp.  salt 
 1/3 tsp. ground cloves 
 3 pieces chopped  crystallized ginger 
 1/2 cup coarsely chopped  walnuts 
 Directions : 
 1. To make Nut Crust: Combine  butter ,  salt  and  Sugar  in food processor. Mix until creamy. Add  walnuts , and process until ingredients are smooth. Place nut mixture into 10-inch deep-dish pie plate. Using spatula, build up sides, and smooth out bottom to form crust. Set aside.
 2. Preheat oven to 325F.
 3. To make Cheesecake Filling: Slice off stem end of large  Eggplant . Cut off about 2 inches more, and peel. Cut chunk into 1-inch cubes, and place in food processor. Process  Eggplant , yielding about 1/2 cup  Eggplant  purée. Add  eggs , and process. Add  salt ,  Sugar  and  chocolate chips , and process on high speed 1 minute. Add  cream cheese  and  vanilla , and process. Let  chocolate  bits stay in mixture, as these sink to form bottom cheesecake layer. Pour mixture into nut crust. Slice remainder of  Eggplant , skin on, into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Wrap in plastic, and set aside.
 4. Bake 55 minutes, or until center is firm. Remove from oven, and cool at least 30 minutes.
 5. Meanwhile, to make Sauce: Combine  orange  and  lemon  juices,  Sugar ,  butter ,  salt , cloves and chopped  ginger  in large saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring often, until boiling. Reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally. Place  Eggplant  slices in saucepan, and cook 25 minutes.
 6. Toast  walnuts  until golden. Remove  Eggplant  slices from sauce mixture, and arrange  Eggplant  attractively on cheesecake, overlapping slices if necessary. Add  nuts  to sauce.
 7. Spoon 6 tablespoons sauce, including  nuts , over  Eggplant  slices. Cover cheesecake in plastic or foil, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Refrigerate remaining sauce.
 8. To serve, heat sauce over low heat. Using sharp knife, cut cheesecake into 12 portions, and place on plates. Spoon sauce over each serving, and pass.
