A cheese native to Holland that is produced from cow's milk. Similar to Gouda, Vlaskaas has a creamy yellow meat that is slightly richer tasting than Gouda with a mildly sweet overtone. Firm in texture, this cheese becomes sharper tasting as it ages. It is a good cheese to serve for snacking, with grained breads, hearty crackers, or on sandwiches with a variety of meats.
