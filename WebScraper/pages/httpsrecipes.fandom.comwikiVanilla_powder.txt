Vanilla powder  is the powdered form of vanilla, made by grinding dried vanilla beans to a fine powder. The powder holds its flavor better when heated than vanilla extract, making it better for flavoring in making baked goods or other foods that need to be heated.  Vanilla Powder  is somewhat hard to find but can generally be found in cake decorating supply stores, gourmet markets and through specialty mail order services.
