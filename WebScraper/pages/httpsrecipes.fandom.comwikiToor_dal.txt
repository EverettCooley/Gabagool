 About Toor dal : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Toor dal on Wikipedia 
 Whole toor lentils are yellow with tan jackets, but they're usually sold skinned and split.  They have a mild, nutty flavor, and they're often cooked as a side dish or ground into flour.  They're sometimes sold with an oily coating, which you should rinse off.  Look for them at Indian markets.
 When they are whole, they are usually referred to as simply "toor", and when split, "toor dal".
