This was one of the big hits of the book preview/cooking class I 
attended. I have made a few changes to it and I have made it twice 
since, the last time making enough for leftovers because it is so 
delicious. I took it to the 4th of July Party we went to and it was 
the first platter to empty. 
 
Marathi Yellow Fried Rice
 Adapted from a recipe by Ruta Kahate from her book, 5 spices 50 dishes
 Like most fried rice recipes, this is usually made with leftover 
rice. In fact Ruata's mother would often convert the previous night's 
steamed rice into this comforting dish for breakfast. I am all for 
that idea! Delicious on it's own, you can also serve it with Crispy 
Okra Raita (recipe to follow soon) for an easy supper. This rice also 
tastes great at room temperature, so it works wonderfully for picnic 
food. 
 
 note Ruta keeps a big stainless steel container of canola oil next 
 to her stove. It has a � cup ladle and she uses it for most 
everything. I use peanut oil instead. 
 � cup Canola oil
1 teaspoon mustard seeds (I use half brown/black and half yellow)
2 medium green or red Serrano chiles (I sometimes use Thai Dragon 
chiles instead) sliced in 1/8 inch rounds (if using Thai chiles, I 
cut them further) 
1 medium red onion cut into � inch dice (about 1 � cups)
� teaspoon ground turmeric 
5 cups cooked white rice, cooled (Basmati is great for this) 
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 � to 2 teaspoons sea salt 
1 teaspoon sugar in the raw
� cup tightly packed cilantro leaves, minced ( I also use curry 
leaves for this aromatic)
 Make the Tadka: Heat oil in a large wok over high heat. When the oil 
begins to smoke add the mustard seeds, covering the pan with a 
spatter screen. After the seeds have stopped sputtering, add the 
chiles. When the chiles are toasted, add the onion and stir fry until 
the onion is golden around the edges. Add the turmeric, stir well and 
remove from the heat. Add the rice, lemon juice, salt and sugar to 
the pan. Toss (Ruta uses gloved hands for this) until all of the rice 
grains are yellow. If you usually salt your rice when cooking (I 
don't, I just throw it in the rice cooker), you will need the lesser 
amount of salt. 
 Return the wok to a low heat, cover and steam until the flavors have 
blended, about 5 minutes. About 5 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro 
and serve, or cool and bring it to a picnic.
