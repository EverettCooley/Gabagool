 Description : 
 Here is a fast appetizer recipe that goes over well at my house. Each bite has gooey, melted cheese and real pizza flavor. Try serving them with pizza sauce for dipping.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 1 tube refrigerated crescent roll dough 
 16 slices  pepperoni , cut into quarters 
 2 pieces  string cheese  cut into quarters 
 ¾ teaspoon Italian seasoning 
 ¼ teaspoon garlic salt 
 Directions : 
 Unroll the crescent dough; separate into eight triangles. Place eight pepperoni slices on each. 
 Place a piece of cheese on the short side of each triangle; sprinkle with ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning. Roll up each, starting with the short side; the pinch seams to seal. 
 Sprinkle with the garlic salt and the remaining Italian seasoning. 
 Place 2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet. 
 Bake at 375° for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
