(You may have to broil in 2 batches if the baking sheet is not large enough to hold all the vegetables.) Broil for 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until tender and lightly browned. 
 4 Spread 2 tablespoons of the  Mayonnaise  mixture on cut sides of baguette. Place  arugula  and  pepper  slices on bottom half. Top with the  Eggplant  slices. Spread the remaining  Mayonnaise  mixture on  Eggplant  slices and sprinkle with  pepper . Top with  Onion  slices and  Cheese .
