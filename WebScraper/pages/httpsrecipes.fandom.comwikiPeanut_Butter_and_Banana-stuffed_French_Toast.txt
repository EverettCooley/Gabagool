 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 4  eggs 
 ¾ cup  half-and-half 
 1 tablespoon  vanilla extract 
 ¼ cup  granulated sugar 
 1 tablespoon  cinnamon 
 8 slices  egg bread 
 ¼ cup  peanut butter 
 1  banana , sliced into thin rounds 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 confectioners' sugar , optional garnish 
 Cinnamon Butter , optional 
 Maple-Beer Syrup 
 Directions : 
 In a 9-inch square dish, beat the eggs with the half-and-half, vanilla, sugar and cinnamon. 
 Make 4 peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches, using a scant tablespoon of peanut butter and one-fourth of the banana rounds per sandwich. 
 Dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture; the liquid should soak well into the bread. 
 Transfer the sandwiches to a platter and pour any extra liquid over them to make sure they are soaked through. 
 Heat vegetable oil on a griddle or in a large skillet over medium-low heat. 
 Place sandwiches on the griddle and cook on both sides until the bread is slightly puffy and cooked through, taking care not to let either side burn. 
 Top each sandwich with a sprinkling of confectioners' sugar, if desired, a tablespoon of  Cinnamon Butter , if desired, and one-fourth of the  Maple-Beer Syrup .
