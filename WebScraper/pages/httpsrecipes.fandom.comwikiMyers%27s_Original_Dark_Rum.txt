There's nothing subtle about Myers's (not a typo!) Dark Jamaican Rum - the name says it all. A quick whiff of the bottle will tell you that it's heavy, cool, and smells of copper and oak. This is rum, and it tastes like it. The grocery store is full of rums I'd never drink straight, not even in cases of direst adversity. But then, most grocery store rums are white. Or spiced. Or flavored. Myers's, however, is rum. Uncomplicated and unapologetic.
