 Description : 
 Makes 1 loaf, 16 servings (2 x ½-inch) slices. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ¾ cups bread  flour , divided 
 1 teaspoon  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 package dry  yeast , about 2 ¼ teaspoons 
 1 cup very warm  water , 120 to 130 °F 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive  oil 
 cooking spray 
 ¼ cup minced fresh  parsley 
 ¼ cup (1 oz) shredded sharp  Cheddar  cheese 
 ¼ cup (1 oz) grated fresh  Parmesan  cheese 
 3 tablespoons minced  jalapeño pepper 
 3 tablespoons minced  green onions 
 1 tablespoon extra virgin  olive oil 
 ⅛ teaspoon black  pepper 
 4  garlic  cloves, minced 
 1 large  egg white , lightly beaten 
 2 teaspoons  water 
 Directions : 
 Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a chef's knife. 
 Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add 1 cup very warm water and 1 tbsp. oil; stir until well-blended. 
 Add 1 ½ cup flour;  just stir until a soft dough forms. 
 Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tbsp. at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands (dough will feel tacky). 
 Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. 
 Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 °F), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers into dough. 
 If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough. Punch dough down, and roll into a 15x10-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. 
 Combine parsley and next 7 ingredients in a bowl. Spread parsley mixture evenly over dough, leaving a ½-inch border. 
 Roll up rectangle tightly, starting at long side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. 
 Place roll, seam side down, on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Using a sharp knife, make ¼-inch-deep diagonal cuts across top of loaf. 
 Cover and let rise 35 minutes or until doubled in size. Combine egg white and 2 teaspoons water, and gently brush over dough. 
 Preheat oven to 375 °F. Bake at 375 °F for 25 to 30 minutes or until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when tapped. 
 Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm and plain or with other side dishes, main dishes, or appetizers.
