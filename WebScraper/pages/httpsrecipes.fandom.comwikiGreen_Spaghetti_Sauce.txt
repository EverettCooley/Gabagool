Description : 
 This makes a bright green sauce...kinda weird to look at but very good tasting. It's a real pretty presentation if you serve it over  spaghetti , half green, half  tomato sauce . It's especially good with Parmesan, if you are lacto-veg. Use fat-free, of course, or a tiny bit of "the good stuff". Do not use  vanilla -flavored  soy milk . I tried it. Yuk
 
 Makes 2 – 3 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1 x 16 oz bag frozen or fresh  spinach  (or a combination frozen/fresh) 
 1 clove  garlic  crushed / minced 
 ½ cup plain  soy milk  /  skim milk 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 If using fresh  spinach , wash and de-stem the leaves. 
 Steam/microwave the  spinach  until cooked. 
 Place it in a blender with the  garlic  and  milk . 
 Whir until you have a nice sauce consistency. 
 Start with less  milk  if you like a thicker sauce, add more, as needed. 
 It depends on how much  spinach  "juice" you use. 
 Taste the sauce, and add  salt , as desired. 
 Serve on top of  spaghetti  or other  pasta .
