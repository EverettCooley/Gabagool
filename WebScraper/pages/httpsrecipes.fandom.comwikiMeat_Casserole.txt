Description : 
 This is for 4 servings
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  noodles , uncooked 
 5 cups  tomato juice 
 4 cups  celery , chopped finely 
 1 cup  green pepper , chopped finely 
 4 cups  meat , cooked and cubed 
 ¼ tsp  pepper , ground fresh 
 3 tsp  salt , (ugh) ½ would do nicely 
 1 tsp diet  margarine 
 Directions : 
 Heat oven to 350°F. 
 Combine all ingredients. 
 Turn into well greased (use a non-stick pan spray by today's standard) casserole; bake 2 hours and 15 minutes. 
 Again I think that this could be done in this day and age in the crockpot.
