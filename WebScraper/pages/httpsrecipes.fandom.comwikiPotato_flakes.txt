 About potato flakes : 
 Dehydrated instant flaked potatoes are uncooked  potatoes  with most of the water removed.
 
 Storage : 
 Store potatoes at room temperature. After opening, store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
 
 Uses & Tips : 
 For a special touch, stir in any of these ingredients after cooking: grated  Parmesan cheese ; shredded  Cheddar cheese ; or  corn .
 For added convenience, cook potatoes the day before and refrigerate in a closed container overnight. Use within 3 days.
 For a Tex-Mex flair, top mashed potatoes with a spoonful of zesty  salsa .
 
 Cooking : 
 In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups  water  and 3 tablespoons  margarine  or  butter  to a rolling boil. Remove from heat. Stir in ¾ cup milk and 2 cups potato flakes with fork until potatoes are of desired consistency. (Makes six ½-cup servings.)
