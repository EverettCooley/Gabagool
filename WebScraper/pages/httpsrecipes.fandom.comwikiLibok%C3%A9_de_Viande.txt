 Libok√© de Viande  (  Meat in Banana Leaves )
 
 Ingredients : 
 Roasted  peanuts , shelled, and skinned, slightly crushed (optional) 
 2-3 Lbs  Beef , cut into large bite-sized pieces 
 1-2  banana  leaves 
 salt 
 cayenne pepper  or red pepper 
 juice of 2  lemons 
 1  chili pepper , chopped (optional) 
 1-2  onions , chopped (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Use equal amounts of  Peanut  and meat. Place the  peanuts  in a saucepan, add enough  water  to partially cover them and bring to a slow boil, stirring often. Reduce heat. Crush  peanuts  with a potato-masher. Simmer for fifteen minutes, then add meat and continue to simmer until all the  water  is evaporated for about thirty minutes. 
 Warm the  banana  leaves for 30 seconds in a hot oven, or grill. Remove the center rib of each leaf by cutting across it with a knife and pulling it off. Cut the ends off each leaf to form a large rectangle.
 Sprinkle  salt  and  pepper  directly onto the  banana  leaves. Place the meat and  Peanut  mixture with  onions ,  chili pepper  on the  banana  leaves. Moisten the meat with  lemon juice  and  water . 
 Fold the  banana  leaves to completely enclose the ingredients in a packet of 2-3 layers with the remaining leaves. 
 Cook the packet on an outdoor grill or in an oven, turning them every ten minutes. Remove from grill after an hour to check the meat, if it is not done, close the packet and continue cooking.
 Serve the cooked dish with boiled  yams .
