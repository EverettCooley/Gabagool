 About Anís : 
 Licor de anís , or simply  anís , is the Spanish term for  anisette liqueur , a colorless alcoholic beverage that tastes somewhat like licorice. It is produced through distillation of the seed of the  anise  plant, which grows throughout the Mediterranean. Anise is a herb also used in infusions, and it is what gives the drink its characteristic taste. The liqueur has a powerful flavor when drunk straight, and can even produce irritation to the throat if not taken slowly due to its high alcoholic content. In mixed drinks, however, it produces a sweet agreeable flavor. It is often mixed simply with water, where it produces a milky white consistency.
