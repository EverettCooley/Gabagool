Ingredients : 
 whites of 3  eggs 
 1 teaspoonful of  flour 
 Â¼ teaspoonful of  cream of tartar 
 1 pint of  peanuts  (chopped to a powder) 
 1 cup of  granulated sugar 
 Directions : 
 First beat the whites of the  eggs  until foamy; add the  cream of tartar  and beat until dry, then gradually beat in half of the  sugar  and continue bearing until the whole is very light; then cut and fold in the other half of the  sugar , the  flour  and the crushed  nuts . 
 Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a tin, lined with a buttered paper, making smooth rounds. 
 Sift  granulated sugar  on the top of each and bake on the floor of a quick oven from five to seven minutes. 
 Nut meats from  English walnuts  or other  nuts  may take the place of the  peanuts . 
 A  cherry  or bit of firm fruit jelly pressed into the center of the top of each round is an improvement.
