This popular beverage lasted for decades in stores across North America, however, due to the artificial elements found in the drink, this article will teach you how to make a healthier alternative of the beverage. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 to 5 teabags of red tea 
 Carbonated natural spring water 
 At least 3 cups of water       A picture of your finished product.     
 One whole lemon 
 At least 10 teaspoons of sugar 
 Mint ( optional ) 
 Ice ( optional ) 
 Directions : 
 First of all, pour in your hot water in a glass pitcher and begin soaking in the tea bags. After the water begins to turn into a deep red colour, proceed by disposing the tea bags and squeezing as much of the juice possible from a lemon. Next, start by adding in your preferred amount of carbonated spring water and sugar and chill the beverage by placing the pitcher in the fridge. When the drink is cooled down to your preference, you should serve immediately either with or without the mint or ice.  Please note that one batch of this beverage can vary due to your pitcher.
