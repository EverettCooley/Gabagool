 Ingredients : 
 100 g butter 
 1/2 c finely chopped onion 
 2 cloves garlic 
 3/4 c flour 
 2 1/2 c milk 
 1/2 t paprika 
 1/4 t fresh grated nutmeg 
 1 t dry parsley 
 olive oil 
 6 oz fish (300g) 
 salt and pepper to taste 
 Bread crumbs 
 Flour to coat 
 1 beaten egg 
 Directions : 
 If you're using salt cod, simmer water for 5 minutes. Drain. Cool. Flake. The smoked fish, just chop or flake. Set aside. 
 Mince the onion and garlic. Sautee until soft in some oil. Add the butter in chunks. When melted. Sprinkle in the flour while mixing. It will turn into a paste fast. It's okay. Cook for a few minutes. Brown if you have time. 
 Pour the milk in 1/2 cup at a time. Whisk until smooth. Turn up the heat a bit if your milk is cold. Add the spices. Whisk until it thickens. You're looking for brownie batter consistency.... i.e. thicker than pancake batter but thinner than bread dough. 
 Add the fish. Mix. Set aside. 
 With two spoons, form egg shapes or rugby ball shapes. drop in flour to LIGHTLY coat. Drop in beaten egg and dredge in bread crumbs. Set aside. When you're down cool the lot in the fridge until you're ready to fry. 
 Fry in some shallow oil on medium high. Don't crowd the pan if you've left them in the fridge. The cold will lower the temperature of the oil.
