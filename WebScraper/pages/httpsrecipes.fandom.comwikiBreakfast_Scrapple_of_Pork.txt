 Description : 
 From my Aunt Maggie’s Collection. Dated 1922
 
 Ingredients : 
 1-1/2 pounds  Pork  shoulder 
 1-quart cold  water 
 1-cup  corn  meal 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 1/8-teaspoon  pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  Pork  into small pieces and crack the bone and put it all into a large kettle. 
 Add the cold  water  and cook until the meat is tender. 
 Remove the bone and measure the liquid that remains. 
 Add enough  water  to make one quart. 
 Heat to the boiling and stir in the  corn  meal. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  and cook for 2 hours. 
 As you cook this you’ll see the meat turning into shreds. 
 Cool. 
 When ready to use, cut into slices and sauté.
