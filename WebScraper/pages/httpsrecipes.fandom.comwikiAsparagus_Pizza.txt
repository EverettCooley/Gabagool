Ingredients : 
 1 (10- to 12-ounce) ball pizza dough (homemade or store-bought) 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 1/8 teaspoon  salt 
 1/8 teaspoon ground black  pepper 
 1/4 cup  ricotta cheese 
 1 cup  mozzarella  cheese (shredded part-skim or whole milk) 
 8  asparagus  spears (peeled and sliced) 
 2 tablespoons  Parmesan  cheese (freshly grated) 
 1 cup baby  arugula 
 Pinch of crushed  red pepper flakes 
 Steps to Make It : 
 Preheat the oven to 500 F. 
 On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to about a 12-inch round. (You can also stretch it using your hands. Note that it does not need to be a perfect circle.) 
 Move the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the olive oil. 
 Spread on the ricotta cheese and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. 
 Trim the woody ends off the asparagus before slicing. 
 Spread the asparagus pieces over the ricotta cheese 
 Finish by evenly spreading out the shredded mozzarella. 
 Reduce the oven temperature to 450 F and bake for approximately 12 minutes. (The dough should be cooked through and the cheese fully melted.) 
 Top with the baby arugula and a sprinkle of the crushed red pepper flakes, and serve hot.
