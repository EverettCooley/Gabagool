Ingredients : 
 2  avocados  - not really very ripe 
 1 can  tuna  (9¼ oz - I use in water-packed.) 
 1 tbsp  lemon juice 
 2 tbsp  mayonnaise  (it can be low calorie.) 
 ½ teas dry  mustard 
 pinch of  salt 
 Dressing : 
 juice from 1  lemon 
 1 small  garlic  clove, crushed very fine 
 pinch of  salt 
 few chopped  parsley  for decoration 
 Directions : 
 Dressing : 
 Put in a shaker and shake very well. 
 Taste; add more  salt  if needed. 
 Filling : 
 Drain the  tuna . 
 With the fork break the  tuna  meat, and add all other ingredients. 
 Mix it well till it becomes really fine. 
 Peel  avocado , (I peel in its length), cut in 1 cm thick rounds and very carefully slide it over its pit and arrange it over a nice serving plate. 
 With a teaspoon, fill the  avocado  in its center. 
 Sprinkle over all with the dressing and toss over the chopped  parsley . 
 Cover with nylon seal wrap, and keep in refrigerator till you serve.
