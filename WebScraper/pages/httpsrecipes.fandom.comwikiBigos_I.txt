Description : 
       Bigos (Polish Hunters Stew)     
 Polish hunters stew.  Bigos  is considered by many to be the national dish of Poland, and as such has many variations around the country and family to family. Some recipes use sauerkraut or pickled cabbage, we’ve used fresh cabbage for extra colour. It’s important not to stir the stew too much as it simmers or you will break up the potatoes and apples. Serve it in bowls with rye bread to mop up the juices.
