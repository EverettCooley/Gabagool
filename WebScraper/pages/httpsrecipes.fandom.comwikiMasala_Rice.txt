MAHARASTRAIN MASALE BHAAT
 
   (serves 2-3)
 
 1 cup Basmati rice
1 cup gherkins (tondli/ tindora), quartered
1/3 cup + 2 tbsp dry, shredded coconut (copra)
4 cloves
2 (2cms) cinnamon sticks
1 tbsp sesame seeds
2 1/2 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
a few curry leaves
a pinch of asafoetida
3-4 green chillies, slit (adjust to taste)
5-6 cashewnuts, broken
3-4 tbsp oil
salt to taste
fresh coconut and cilantro for garnishing
 Wash the rice in two to three changes of water. Drain and keep aside.
On moderate heat, roast the copra, coriander seeds, cumin, sesame, cloves and cinnamon till the coconut turns golden. Let cool. Put in a spice/ coffee grinder and grind into a powder. Keep aside.
Heat oil in a pan. When hot, add mustard seeds. When they begin to pop, add curry leaves, asafoetida and chillies and saute for a few minutes. Next add gherkins and saute some more. Add rice and mix well. Add the powdered spices and mix until the rice is well coated. Add cashews and season to taste. Add about two cups of water, cover the pan with a lid and cook until the rice is done.
Garnish with fresh coconut and cilantro. Serve hot with a raita and fried papad
