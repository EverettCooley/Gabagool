 Ingredients : 
 5 medium  leeks 
 1½ Tbs.  olive oil  or  butter 
 1  bay leaf 
 2 large  carrots , peeled, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces 
 4 peeled slices  butternut squash , about ½ inch thick, halved 
 2 medium all-purpose  potatoes , scrubbed and cut into large chunks 
 1 cup low-sodium  vegetable broth 
 Directions : 
 Trim root ends of  leeks , leaving white bulbs and about 2 inches of light green. Cut  leeks  in half lengthwise, removing and discarding outer layer. Fan layers and rinse under cold running  water  to remove grit. 
 In large skillet, heat  oil  over medium-high heat. Add  leeks , cut sides down, and  bay leaf . Cook until  leeks  are lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. 
 Add  carrots ,  squash ,  potatoes , ⅓ cup of broth and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. Cover and cook over medium heat 15 minutes. 
 Add remaining broth in two stages, as liquid cooks off. (You want to end up with a saucy glaze. If there’s too much liquid in pan when almost done, remove lid to reduce glaze. If there’s too little, add a tablespoon or so of  water .) 
 After 12 to 15 minutes, all vegetables should be tender. 
 Remove  bay leaf  and serve.
