 Wikipedia Article  About Leerdammer on Wikipedia 
 Leerdammer is a Dutch semi-hard cheese made from cow's milk. It has a creamy white flesh similar in appearance and flavor to Emmental. It has a sweet and somewhat nutty flavor that becomes more pronounced with age. This cheese can be served cold as an appetizer, a snack, a sandwich cheese, or as a breakfast cheese with meats or bread. It also can be baked and grilled, as it melts nicely to complement a variety of food dishes.
