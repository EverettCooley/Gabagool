Description : 
 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Butler Estate in Greenville, Texas in 1987. I do not like okra which is strange for a Texas gal but I make this for my neighbor who can't get enough okra. This came from my Aunt Lois' collection. Dated 1962.
