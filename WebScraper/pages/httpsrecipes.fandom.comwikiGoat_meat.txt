Though goat meat has been enjoyed in southern Europe, Latin America and many Mediterranean countries for centuries, it has never really caught on in the United States. IT is often called  chevon  when from adults and  cabrito  or just  kid  when from young animals, is the meat of the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus).
 The meat of mature goats is extremely tough and strong-flavored. Most goat meat consumed comes from a kid, a baby goat that is usually not more than 6 months old. Kid meat is as tender and delicate as that of young lamb, and it can be prepared in any manner suitable for lamb. It can sometimes be found in specialty meat markets. Goats also provide milk, which is usually made into goat cheese. Fresh goats milk can sometimes be purchased in health-food stores; canned goats milk is carried in many supermarkets.
