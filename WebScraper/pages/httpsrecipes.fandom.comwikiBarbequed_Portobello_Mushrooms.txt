Ingredients : 
 portobello mushrooms 
 balsamic vinegar 
 Directions : 
 When i get invited to a bar-b-q, my favorite things to bring are  portobello mushrooms  and  corn  on the cob. They're easy to deal with. Marinate the portobellos in  balsamic vinegar  for an hour beforehand and then throw'em on the grill like burgers. I remove the stem and cut slits on the cap. In a group of non-vegetarians, the sight of 5" diameter  mushrooms  on the grill is a conversation-starter.
