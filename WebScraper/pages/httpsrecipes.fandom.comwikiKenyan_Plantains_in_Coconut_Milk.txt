 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 3-4  plantains , sliced in rounds 
 ¼ teaspoon of  salt 
 1 teaspoon of  curry  powder 
 ½ teaspoon of  cinnamon 
 1/8 teaspoon cloves 
 1-2 cups of  coconut milk 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients, except the  coconut milk , in a heavy saucepan and stir. 
 Pour in 1 cup of  coconut milk  and simmer over low heat until the  plantains  absorbed the  milk  and are very tender. 
 It takes a while for them to get soft; give them about the same time you would need for cooking  potatoes . 
 You can add more  coconut milk  if you desire. 
 Serve hot and try with fish or curries.
