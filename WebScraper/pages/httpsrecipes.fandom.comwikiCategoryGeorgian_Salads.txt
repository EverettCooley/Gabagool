 Lobio is the name given to the most famous Georgian salad, which is made from kidney beans. This name is shared by the dried beans and the salads that use them as the main ingredients. The kidney beans have two varieties in Georgia: red and white. People are recommended to buy smaller beans. This salad is prepared in many ways, as the beans can be combined with celery, butter, plum sauce and eggs. Georgia is well known for both its salad and its dressings.
