 Ingredients : 
 1 cup uncooked hulled  red lentils 
 1 1/2 cups fine- grain   bulgur wheat 
 1/3 cup  olive oil 
 1 large  Onion , minced 
 1 Tbs.  Red Pepper Paste 
 1 tsp.  paprika 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper  to taste 
 6 scallions, thinly sliced 
 1 bunch fresh  Italian parsley , washed and finely chopped 
 Directions : 
 1. Bring 6 cups of  water  to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the  red lentils  and  bulgur wheat , cover the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the  grains  are tender.
 
 2. Meanwhile, heat the  oil  in a large skillet over medium-low heat, and cook the  Onion  for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring, until translucent. Add the red pepper Paste,  paprika ,  salt  and  pepper . Mix well, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
 
 3. Stir the  Onion  mixture into the  Lentils  and  grains , cover and set aside for 20 minutes. Stir in half of the scallions and half of the chopped  parsley . Spoon onto a large serving platter, and garnish with remaining scallions and  parsley .
 
 
 Alternatively, when the lentil-and- grain  mixture is cool enough to handle, use your hands to knead it together. Once the mixture is well blended, form it into balls or shape it into patties. Arrange the balls or patties on a platter, garnish with remaining scallions and  parsley , and serve.
