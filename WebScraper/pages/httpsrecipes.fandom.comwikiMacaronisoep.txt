Description : 
 Macaroni soup. Once the Dutch realised that the Italians made the most wonderful pastas, they of course took them and adapted them. This soup is much the same as the  Rijstsoep  ( rice  soup), except made with  macaroni .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â½ liter  stock 
 50 g  minced beef , rolled into small balls 
 40 g  macaroni 
 50 g grated  cheese 
 Directions : 
 Bring the stock to the boil and add the  macaroni . 
 Pour in slowly so that the stock does not come off the boil, this way the  macaroni  will not stick to the bottom of the pan. 
 Let the  macaroni  cook for about 15 - 20 minutes. 
 Add the  minced beef  balls about 10 minutes to the end. 
 Add the grated  cheese  just before serving.
