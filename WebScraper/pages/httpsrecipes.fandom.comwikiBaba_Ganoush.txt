 Cook Time : 15 minutes 
 Serves : 10 
 Ingredients 
 1 medium-large  eggplant , any variety, 1 to 1½ pounds 
 2 tablespoons raw  tahini 
 juice of 1  lime 
 1 clove  garlic , crushed 
 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 ¾ tsp  salt 
 paprika   or   cayenne pepper , as a garnish 
 Directions 
 Season the eggplant with ¼ teaspoon of salt. 
 Roast the eggplant. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the flesh should be fully cooked and the skin should be burned and falling off easily. An effective method is to prick the eggplant and place it a few inches under a broiler, turning it as the exposed skin blackens, about every 3 – 4 minutes. Place a pan underneath to catch the juices, and discard them. 
 Scrape off the eggplant skin. 
 It's all right if you miss a few burned bits. 
 Finely chop or blend the eggplant flesh with the rest of the ingredients. 
 The consistency should be smooth. 
 Reserve a bit of the olive oil, and drizzle that over the top. 
 Sprinkle with some paprika or cayenne. 
 If using cayenne, sprinkle sparingly.
