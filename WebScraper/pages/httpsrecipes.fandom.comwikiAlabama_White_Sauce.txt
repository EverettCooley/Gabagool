Description : 
 This white-hot American barbecue sauce is added and made with real mayonnaise used for meat and seafood and great for grilling and basting. The effort, flavor, and quality are ever worth it.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 1 quart  mayonnaise 
 ¾ quart  apple cider vinegar 
 ½ cup  corn syrup 
 1 teaspoon  molasses , optional 
 ¼ tablespoon  cayenne pepper 
 3 tablespoons prepared  horseradish 
 3 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2 ¼ teaspoons freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Place all ingredients in a very large blender or food processor. (It may be necessary to do this in 2 batches; just add half of each ingredient and then repeat.) 
 Blend for 1 minute, or until thoroughly combined and mixture is smooth. 
 Pour sauce into a large bowl. 
 
 
 Notes : 
 Servings:  4 tablespoons or 3 cups 
 Use when grilling chicken (or meat); brush lightly over the chicken during the last few minutes of grilling. This sauce is also great for dipping; set some sauce aside for passing at the table.
