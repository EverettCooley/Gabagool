A type of unsalted yeast starter used in Italy to bake the traditional country breads, also known as artisan breads, that have a crunchy outer crust covering a chewy inner crumb, such as Francese, Pugliese or Ciabatta breads. The qualities provided by this stator for baked goods include a moist texture, a depth of flavor and a wonderful aroma. Unlike other yeast starters that are kept going to produce many loaves, such as sourdough starter, biga starter is made fresh each time the bread is made.
