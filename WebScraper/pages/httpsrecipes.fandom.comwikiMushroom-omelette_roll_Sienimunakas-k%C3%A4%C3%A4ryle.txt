 Omelette batter : 
 6  eggs 
 5 dl  milk 
 1 dl  wheat flour 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  white pepper 
 Filling : 
 3 tbsp  butter ,  margarine  or cooking  oil 
 1 litre  chanterelles ,  hedgehog mushrooms ,  ceps 
 2 – 3  onions ,  salt ,  black pepper 
 basil  or  thyme 
 a little  cream  or  crème fraîche

 grated  cheese

 Preheat the oven to 200 °C. 
 To prepare the batter, first mix the  flour  in the  milk . 
 Beat the  eggs  in a separate bowl and add to the  flour  and  milk  mixture. 
 Spice with  salt  and  white pepper . 
 Line a high-edged baking plate with greaseproof paper and pour the omelette batter on the paper. 
 Bake in the oven until light brown. 
 Overturn the omelette on another piece of greaseproof paper and remove the paper from the bottom. 
 Chop the  onions  for the filling. 
 Fry the chopped  mushrooms  in hot  oil , add the  onions  and let cook until the liquid has nearly evaporated. 
 Spice with  salt  and  pepper , and, if you like,  basil  or  thyme  (in case you prefer the filling to be more sauce-like, add a little  cream  to the mixture and let cook for a while). 
 Check the taste. 
 Spread the mixture on the omelette and roll the sheet up. 
 Carefully move the roll on a greased ovenproof plate and sprinkle grated  cheese  on top. 
 Heat the omelette roll in 200 °C before serving.
