Description 
 Saffron Rissotto with Asparagus and Peas  from the Public Health Cookbook—original source of recipe, public domain government resource
 
 Serves : 4 
 Ingredients 
 6 cups low-sodium  vegetable broth 
 16 ounces  asparagus , trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces 
 ¾ cup dry  white wine  (may use water instead) 
 ½ teaspoon  saffron  threads 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 cups  Arborio rice  or  long-grain rice 
 1 cup fresh or frozen  peas , thawed 
 ¼ cup low-fat grated  Parmesan cheese  (optional) 
 Directions 
 Bring broth to a boil in a medium saucepan then add asparagus and cook for 2–3 minutes until crisp-tender. Use a slotted spoon to remove asparagus and set aside. Reduce heat to medium-low then stir in the wine and saffron and simmer, uncovered. 
 Heat olive oil in a large saucepan, over medium heat. Add rice and stir for 2 minutes or until translucent. Stir in ½ cup of the broth to rice and continue to stir until broth is absorbed (about 8–10 minutes.) Continue to add ½ cup of broth at a time and stir often until all of the broth is absorbed and rice is tender. 
 Add the cooked asparagus and peas and stir to combine. 
 Serve with an optional sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
