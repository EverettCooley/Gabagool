Ingredients : 
 vinegar 
 Greek  oregano 
 Directions : 
 Well, it's simple and unmeasured. I decide how much  vinegar  I want to steep, and choose a wide-mouthed jar of that size. 
 
 I fill this jar with roughly equal amounts of fresh Greek  oregano  (a very strong, hot variety...beware as some fresh  oregano  is insipid),  mint  (for this, i like the  yerba buena  variety ...a coarse, strong spearmint), and  winter savory  (stronger flavored than  summer savory ). 
 I generally try to bruise the leaves a bit. I pour the  vinegar  over the herbs, put a layer of waxed paper and a couple of layers of plastic wrap over the mouth of the bottle (to help retard the inevitable corrosion of the metal cap) and then screw on the jar lid. 
 I place the jar either on a sunny windowsill or on the deck for a few weeks, and then strain the  vinegar  through a coffee filter and return it to the original  vinegar  bottle (which usually has a more corrosion-resistant lid). I don't like to leave any herbs in the  vinegar , and don't like to add any for decoration, either, because they tend to add a funky taste that i don"t care for if they sit long enough
