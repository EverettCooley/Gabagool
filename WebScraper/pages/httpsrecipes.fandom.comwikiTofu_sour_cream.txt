 About Tofu sour cream : 
 A sour cream substitute made usually with silken tofu and lemon juice.
 I like to add a little salt, veggie stock and a dash of apple cider vinegar to the above ingredients. I also like to make it with cashews soaked 6-8 hours in room temp water or 30 minutes with boiling water in place of tofu.
 
 Can also add dill to make it a dip for crudite
