 About Pimento : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Pimento on Wikipedia 
 The pimento or cherry pepper is a variety of large, red, heart-shaped chile pepper (Capsicum annuum) that measures 3 to 4 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide (medium, elongate).
 Pimento or piment√£o are Portuguese words for "bell pepper", while pimenta refers both to chile peppers and to black pepper.
 The flesh of the sweet pimento is sweet, succulent and more aromatic than that of the red bell pepper. These pimentos are the familiar red stuffing found in green olives. Some varieties of the pimento type are hot including the Floral Gem and Santa Fe Grande varieties.
 More than 85% of stuffed olives, especially the green Spanish variety, are stuffed with pimento, while other stuffings; garlic, cheese, etc., make up the remaining percentage of preferred stuffings.
