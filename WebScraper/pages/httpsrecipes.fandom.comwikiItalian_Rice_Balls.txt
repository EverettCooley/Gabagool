 Ingredients : 
 800 ml.  vegetable stock 
 50 g.  unsalted butter 
 275 g.  risotto rice 
 175 g.  mozzarella  cheese, cut into small cubes 
 6  shallots , finely sliced 
 ½ cup mixed herbs, chopped ( parsley ,  basil  and  oregano )  or  (4 tablespoons Italian seasoning) 
 1 finely grated large  orange 
 6 tablespoons grated  Parmesan cheese 
 6 tablespoons  olive oil , for frying 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 2 teaspoons  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Heat the stock in a large saucepan and keep on a constant simmer. 
 Melt butter in another saucepan and add rice stirring to coat all the grains; just add stock, one ladle at a time until absorbed. 
 Continue until the rice is tender but still firm, approximately 18–20 minutes. 
 Add mozzarella, shallots, herbs, orange zest, Parmesan, salt and pepper; mix and remove from the heat and allow to cool; the rice is much easier to shape when it is cool. 
 Shape the rice into 8 balls. 
 Dip each ball into the beaten egg and coat well, then roll in the breadcrumbs, pressing crumbs into any areas that may look a bit bare. 
 Heat oil in a large pan, then add the rice balls and cook until golden all over; you can do this in two batches if necessary. 
 Drain well on the kitchen paper.
