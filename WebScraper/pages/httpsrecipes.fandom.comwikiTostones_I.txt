Description : 
 Green fried plantain
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 green  plantains 
 4 – 5 large clove of  garlic 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 About 1 quart of very cold  water 
 Enough  vegetable oil  or  shortening  for deep frying 
 A large brown paper bag or a tortilla press 
 Directions : 
 Crush  garlic  in a mortar or with a  garlic  press. 
 Place a little cold  water  in a large bowl or pitcher. 
 Add  garlic ,  salt  and  pepper  (make sure that these ingredients are well blended). 
 Add a little more cold  water . 
 Cut off both ends of a  plantain  and with a sharp knife run a slit down one of the veins of the  plantain . Remember not to cut to deep, what we want to do is to be able to remove the skin not to split the  plantain  in half. Now with the thumbs of both hands start prying the skin apart until you have removed it completely. 
 Now slice the  plantain  on a diagonal about half inch thick. Place the slices in the  water  mixture making sure that they are completely covered with the  water . Continue this process until you have finished with all the  plantains  add  water  as needed (The secret is to keep them well bathed so that they don't turn in color). This would be a good time to taste the  water  making sure that you have a good  garlic  taste and that the  salt  and  pepper  are to your liking. 
 Cover and place in refrigerator for at least a half hour or longer. What we want is for the flavor in the  water  to be absorbed by the  plantain . 
 Place  oil  or  shortening  in a deep fryer or cauldron and bring up to heat about 350°F. 
 Once the fryer has come up to heat drain the slices on at a time and place them in the fryer. Depending on how big your fryer is place enough so that they can float freely, remove after ten minutes and allow to drain on a piece of paper towel.
