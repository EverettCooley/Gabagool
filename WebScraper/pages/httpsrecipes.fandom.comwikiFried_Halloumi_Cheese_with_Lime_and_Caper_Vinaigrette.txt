Ingredients : 
 12 oz  halloumi cheese 
 2 tbsp  flour , seasoned with  salt  and  pepper 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 Dressing : 
 juice and zest of 1  lime 
 1 tbsp  white wine vinegar 
 1½ tbsp  capers , drained 
 1 clove  garlic , finely chopped 
 1 tsp  grain mustard 
 1 tbsp chopped fresh  cilantro  leaves 
 2 tbsp extra-virgin  olive oil 
 salt  and freshly-ground  black pepper 
 Garnish : 
 A few sprigs of  cilantro 
 Directions : 
 First of all, pat the  cheese  dry with paper towels. 
 Then, using a sharp knife, slice it into eight slices, including the ends. 
 Now dredge in seasoned  flour . 
 Prepare the dressing by simply beating all the ingredients together in a small mixing bowl. 
 When you're ready to serve the  halloumi , heat the  oil  in a skillet over medium heat. 
 When the  oil  is really hot add  cheese  to the hot skillet—they take 1 minute on each side to cook, so by the time the last one's in, it will almost be time to turn the first one over. 
 They need to be a good golden color on each side. 
 Serve them on warmed plates with the dressing poured over and garnished with the  cilantro  sprigs.
