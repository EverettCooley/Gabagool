 About bok choi : 
 Also known as pak choi, this leafy-green Chinese vegetable belongs to the cabbage family. It is best suited to brief stir-frying or steaming to keep its mild flavor. It is also recommended that the leafy portion be cooked separately from the stems as the leaves cook much more quickly.
 It has dark green leaves and white celery-like stalks that have a mild, slightly peppery flavor. Both the greens and the stalks are popular in salads and the stalks are often used in stir-fry recipes. Also known as Bok choy, Pak choi and White Mustard Cabbage. Peking cabbage is available throughout the year. When selecting, look for a firm compact head with fresh leaves. The cabbage should be used when fresh if possible because it does not store well. If it is necessary to store, keep it in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic, and it should stay fresh for 4 to 5 days.
 Baby bok choy can be as small as 4 inches (10 cm) in length.
