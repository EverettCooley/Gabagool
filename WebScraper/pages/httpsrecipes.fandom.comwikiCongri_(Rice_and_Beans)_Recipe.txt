Ingredients : 
 6.5 oz of dry black beans 
 4 cups of water 
 2 1/4 tbsp of salt 
 1 minced sprig of fresh thyme 
 1/2 minced green pepper 
 3 tbsp of vegetable oil 
 A piece of lean pork; diced 
 2 minced garlic cloves 
 1/4 cup of red chili pepper; seedless and minced 
 2 minced onions 
 2 lbs of rice 
 1/2 tbsp of ground black pepper 
 Preparation : 
 Wash the beans in a strainer with running water until the water comes out clear. Place them in a large pot with 4 cups of water, 1 tbsp of saucepan, the thyme and half of the green pepper.
 Bring to the boil over strong flame, reduce the flame and let it boil for 3 hours or until the beans are tender. Add more water if it evaporates too much. Strain the cooked beans and set the water aside to boil the rice.
 Remove 1 tbsp of beans and mash them in a mortar until you get a fine paste. In a large pan with oil, fry the pork until it is crispy and has released all the fat.
 Remove the meat with the skimmer and drain on paper towels. Set it aside and fry the garlic in the pan along with the rest of the green pepper, the chili and the onion for 5 minutes while stirring constantly.
 Add the mashed beans, the remaining beans and the pork meat. Reduce the flame and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
 Place all these ingredients in the pot with the bean water and add the rice, 1 1/4 tbsp of saucepan and the black pepper.
 Bring everything to the boil, always stirring to mix all the ingredients, let it boil for 20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid has boiled dry. Rectify the salt. Serve immediately.
