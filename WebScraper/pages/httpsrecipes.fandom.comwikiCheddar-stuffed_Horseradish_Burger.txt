 Original recipe 
 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  onion , chopped 
 2 tablespoons bottled  horseradish 
 ¾ teaspoon  garlic 
 ½ teaspoon  sea salt 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1½ pounds  ground beef  (option: use  ground buffalo  instead of ground beef) 
 4 ounces sharp  cheddar  cheese, cut in ¼ inch cubes 
 Directions : 
 In a medium bowl thoroughly combine the onion, horseradish, garlic, salt and pepper. 
 Add the beef and with your hands lightly bring all the ingredients together; being careful not to over work the meat. 
 With dampened hands, form the meat into 4 patties of even thickness (these are fairly large patties; feel free to make 6 smaller patties if desired) 
 Make a large depression in the top of the patties, about 2 inches wide. 
 Place ¼ of the cheddar cheese in the depression (you may need to push some of the cheese lightly into the bottom) and bring the meat over the cheese, enclosing it completely. 
 Place on a lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, light the grill or preheat the broiler. 
 Cook the burgers for 5 minutes a side or until desired doneness.
