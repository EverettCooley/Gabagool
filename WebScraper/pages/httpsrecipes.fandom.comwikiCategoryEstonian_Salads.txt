 As most of the Estonian dishes are based on meat, the salads are also made in great numbers. In most of the cases, the ingredients are vegetables, such as carrots, cucumbers and potatoes, but the Estonians do not hesitate to use in their salads cod and mushrooms. Also, one of the most popular salads in Estonia is one that is made from pumpkin. Potato salad with red beet is another famous salad, across the country.
