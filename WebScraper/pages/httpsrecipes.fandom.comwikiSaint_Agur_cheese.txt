 About Saint Agur cheese : 
 Saint Agur (pronounced /sɛ̃t agyʀ/) "sant ah-GOOR") is a blue cheese made from pasteurized cow's milk from the village of Beauzac in the Monts du Velay, part of the mountainous Auvergne region of central France. Developed in 1988 by the cheese company Bongrain, it is made from pasteurised cow's milk, enriched with cream, and contains 60% butterfat qualifying it as a double-cream cheese. Aged for 60 days in cellars, the cheese becomes stronger and spicier as it ages.
 The moist, rich, white cheese has characteristic olive green mold veins throughout and a smooth, creamy texture with a subtle mild spicy taste resembling a softer, and finer Roquefort in presentation and taste. It is not as salty as more traditional blue cheese, and its tangy and creamy nature are balanced so not to overpower with a sharp bite like a Stilton, although this is dependent in the age of the cheese. Due to its double-cream nature, this cheese is easily spread and also melts well.
 Saint Agur is produced in 2-kilogram octagonal cylinders, rendering a shape that makes it easy to cut into wedges. It has no rind and comes in foil to prevent the cheese from becoming more blue.
 No saint has ever been named Agur.
 No village, in France or elsewhere, has ever been named Saint Agur.
