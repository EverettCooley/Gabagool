Description : 
 Simple basic use of  boudain sausage  to make into boudain balls.
 
       Basic Boudin Balls     
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs  boudain sausages 
 2  eggs , beaten 
 1 cup  breadcrumbs , seasoned with  salt  and pepper 
 oil  (for frying) 
 Directions : 
 Remove boudain from casing; mix in fresh chiles. 
 Shape mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball or smaller. 
 Dip in beaten  egg  mixture and then into seasoned  bread crumbs . 
 I like to either use a large bowl with the  bread crumbs  in it and tossing 10 balls in it at a time and"tossing" to coat. 
 Best to coat only as many balls as you can fry at one time; seasoning gets soggy if allowed to sit. 
 Or, put  bread  crumbs in a large plastic bag, add balls, and"shake". 
 Heat approx 1½ inch of  oil  in a large, heavy bottomed (cast iron is excellent) skillet. 
 Deep fat fry balls at 375°F (temp may be lowered, but no lower than 345°F) until golden brown, about 10 minutes per batch. 
 Drain on paper towels.
