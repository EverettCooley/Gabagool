Ingredients : 
 2 cups seedless grapes (I used purple grapes for the color, but it really doesn’t matter what kind you use) 
 1 apple, cored (leave the peel on) 
 1 cup frozen strawberries (if your strawberries aren’t frozen, no problem – just add more ice) 
 ½ cup fresh pineapple chunks 
 1 teaspoon stevia powder 
 1 cup ice 
 1 ½ cups water 
 Directions : 
 Put all ingredients together in a blender and grind until the desired slushy consistency is reached.
