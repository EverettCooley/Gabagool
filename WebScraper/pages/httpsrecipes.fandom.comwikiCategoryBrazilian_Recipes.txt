 Recipes in the Brazilian cuisine revolve around shrimp as the basic element in a meal, served with beans or rice as side dishes. A regular shrimp stew is prepared using headless shrimp, lime juice, coconut milk, olive and dendi oil, thin sliced onions, crushed and minced garlic, tomatoes, green peppers, and parsley. For the side dish, you can choose brown beans (carioquinha), traditional feijoada black beans, fradinho beans, white beans, and even chili beans to be served with the main course. The rice is great for a dise dish as well and commonly used. It is preferred to be long grained and is prepared with olive oil, garlic, onion, tomatoes and sliced black olives. Knowing how to bake a meringue is an important issue, one that will guarantee a great dessert. The torte is build by layering the meringue rounds with fresh strawberries, fresh whipped cream, and vanilla flavoring.
