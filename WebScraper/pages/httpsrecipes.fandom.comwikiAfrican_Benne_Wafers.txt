Ingredients : 
 1 	 cup  sesame seeds , toasted 
 3/4 	cup  butter , melted 
 1 1/2 	cups packed  brown sugar 
 1 	 egg 
 1 	teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 1 	cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/4 	teaspoon  salt 
 1/4 	teaspoon  baking powder 
 Directions : 
 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
 2. If your  sesame seeds  are not toasted, place them on an ungreased baking sheet and toast for 10–12 minutes or until they turn light brown.
 3. They may burn easily, so watch closely to prevent this from happening.
 4. Mix the  brown sugar , melted  butter ,  egg ,  vanilla extract ,  flour ,  salt ,  baking powder , and toasted  sesame seeds  together until well combined in a large mixing bowl.
 5. Drop cookie dough by half-teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Make sure that at least 2 inches separate them; they spread A LOT.
 6. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 5–6 minutes or until edges become light brown. They will appear a little puffy when you take them out.
 7. Let them sit for 2–3 minutes.
 8. They should be pretty flat.
 9. Remove them to a wire rack and allow to cool (be careful—they're pretty crispy and crunchy!).
 10. Store cooled cookies in an air-tight container.
