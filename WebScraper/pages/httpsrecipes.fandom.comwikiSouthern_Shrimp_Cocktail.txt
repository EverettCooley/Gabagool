Description : 
 Have the seafood market steam the shrimp to save time. Serve the shrimp, okra, and breadsticks on a platter around a bowl of the sauce, or make individual cocktails. Use 4 oz votive candleholders, shot glasses, cordial glasses, or mini martini glasses. You can make the sauce three days ahead.
