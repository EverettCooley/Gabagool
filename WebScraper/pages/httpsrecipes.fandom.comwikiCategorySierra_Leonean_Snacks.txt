 The most frequent snacks consist of vegetable meals, such as the spinach plasas or the traditional binch akara. The binch akara is made with black-eyed beans, vegetable oil and finely chopped onion and the meal gets a golden color and a delicate taste. The spinach plasas is made of frozen chopped spinach, smoked fish, chopped onions, groundnut paste, palm oil, cayenne pepper and stewing or roast meat. The abala is another loved snack, which is made of rice flour, onion, peppers, cooked shrimp or flaked fish and palm oil or vegetable oil. The ingredients are steamed for a long time until the rice is cooked and the mixture is greased in banana leaves.
