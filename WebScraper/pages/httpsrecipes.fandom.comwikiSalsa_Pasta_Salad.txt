Ingredients : 
 1 lbs  large shell pasta , cooked 
 1 basket (pint?)  cherry tomatoes , halved 
 1 to 2 cups fresh  corn  kernels (or frozen and thawed) 
 1  sweet pepper  (color of your choice), chopped 
 1 x 8 oz can mild, chopped  green chiles 
 1 x 16 oz can  kidney beans  or equivalent amount cooked 
 1 small  red onion , chopped 
 1 jar (~16oz?) of your favorite  salsa 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients well and refrigerate at least several hours. 
 The  pasta  will soak up the salsa, so you may need to add more just before serving if you like a "wetter"  pasta  salad.
