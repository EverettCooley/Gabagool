Peach Bars
 1 3/4 cups flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking soda
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups rolled oats, uncooked
1 cup peach preserves or jam
 Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 13x9-inch pan. In a medium 
mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda. In a large mixing 
bowl, cream butter and sugar together, using an electric mixer, until 
fluffy. Stir in flour mixture, then oats. Mixture will be somewhat 
crumbly. Press 2/3 of the mixture over bottom of baking pan. 
Carefully spread preserves evenly over crust to within 1/2-inch of 
edge. Distribute remaining crumb mixture over top and press lightly 
to form a firm crust. Bake for 20 minutes, until browned. Cool 
completely; cut into bars. 
 Makes 2 dozen.
