Garam  means hot in "Hindi". In the same way Americans use  salt  and  pepper , Indians use  garam masala . It can be added as a  spicy  flavor enhancer to almost any dish. You can use it at the table, just sprinkle it on, or during the cooking process. I offer you this homemade version as it is far better than any pre-blend.
