Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  butternut squash 
 2 cloves  garlic 
 1 dash  salt 
 1 dash  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Peel and cut  squash  into small cubes. place in a pot with  garlic  cloves, cover with  water  or veg broth. 
 Bring to a boil and simmer until  squash  is extremely tender. drain liquid (reserve about ¼ to ½ cup.) 
 Process  squash  in food processor / hand blender, while adding a little bit of the liquid. Note: don't be too generous with the liquid. if your sauce is too runny, you will end up with a soggy pizza. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Notes : 
 I usually buy pre-made vegan dough from the grocery store and roll it our according to the instructions. Other options would be to make your dough from scratch, or buy a pre-baked crust. 
 Use squash-based sauce in place of tomato-based pizza sauce. Add toppings of your choice.
