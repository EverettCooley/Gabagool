 Description : 
 One of the best trips I have been on was driving to Louisianna with my two sisters. We went specifically to see the Acadian settlements and it was thrilling to see all the names were the same as in my background from the Acadian part of Canada. So this recipe is named in honor of all my Acadian relatives. Creole seasoning is a blend of  garlic ,  salt ,  paprika ,  cayenne ,  basil  and  thyme  in equal amounts.
