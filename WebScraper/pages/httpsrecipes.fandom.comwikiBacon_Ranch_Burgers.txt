Description : 
 I serve these with  lettuce ,  tomato , sliced  onions  (raw and cooked) and some bottled Ranch dressing on a lightly toasted oversize hamburger bun.
 Have also made these up and put in foil packets along with sliced  onions , sliced  tomatoes ,  dill  pickle slices and cooked on the grill and/or in the oven. Good any way you cook it.
