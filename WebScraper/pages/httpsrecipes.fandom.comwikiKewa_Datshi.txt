 4  potatoes 
 1/3 cup of  Cheese , (swiss, farmers or almost any kind of  white cheese )

 1 tbs  oil 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1/2 tsp  chilli powder  (vary amount according to your tolerance) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut  potatoes  into small pieces (I prefer them about the size of my little finger but you don't know how big my finger is). Put the  potatoes  along with some  oil  and  salt  in a saucepan or pot. Add 1 and 1/2 cup of  water . Cut the  Cheese  into small pieces and when potatoe is almost cooked, add the  Cheese . You can add some chooped  onions  and  tomatoes  to taste. Don't forget the  chilli powder . You don't want too much  water  in this dish but don't let it dry up completely either. Add little  water  everytime it gets low.
