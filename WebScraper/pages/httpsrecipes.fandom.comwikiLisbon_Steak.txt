 4  tenderloin  steaks, cut ½ inch thick 
 2 tablespoons of  butter  or  margarine 
 1 pint container of  heavy cream 
 ½ teaspoon of  black pepper 
 2 tablespoons of  brandy 
 1 x 8 oz can of  mushrooms 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Over medium heat , melt the  butter  in a 12 inch skillet. 
 Fry the steaks turning them over after 2 minutes or so. 
 You do not want to over cook them at this point. 
 They will finish cooking later. 
 Add the  cream ,  mushrooms  to the steaks and cook for 5 minutes. 
 Add the  brandy  and  pepper  and simmer over low heat. 
 Simmer steaks for 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Served with mashed  potatoes  or fries. OK, to make it a little healthier a vegetable would be nice.
