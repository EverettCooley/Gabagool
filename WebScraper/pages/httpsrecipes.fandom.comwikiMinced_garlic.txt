Minced  garlic :
 
Separate 2 or 3 Bulbs of  garlic  Into Individual Cloves And Peel. The Easy Way to do This is to Whack Each clove With The Broad Side of a Large Heavy Chef's Knife; This Loosens The Skin, Which Can be Quickly Stripped Away. Mince  garlic  Moderately Fine. (i Use a Food Processor, Pulsing to Just The Right Degree of Fineness; if You Mince by hand, Sprinkle Chopping Board With  salt  -- That Way The  garlic  Won't Stick to The Knife or Your Hands.) Spoon Minced  garlic  Into a Glass or Porcelain Ramekin And Press Plastic Food Wrap Flat Over Surface of  garlic . Slip Ramekin Into a Small Plastic Zipper Bag, Press Out All The Air, Seal, And Store in Refrigerator. Every Time You Dip Into The  garlic , Reseal as Carefully as You Did The First Time Around. Because Most Recipes Call For  garlic  by The clove, Here's a Handy Table That Translates Minced Cloves Into Teaspoons:
 
 1 Small clove  garlic  = 1/2 to 1 Teaspoon Minced 
 1 Medium-Size clove  garlic  = 1 to 11/2 Teaspoons Minced 
 1 Large clove  garlic  = 2 to 2 1/2 Teaspoons Minced
