Description : 
 These are pretty large servings, and no one has to be hungry after eating... You can replace almost all the vegetables with something else, it should be a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main "rule" in this recipe... If you are a weight watcher one portion will take about 10 extra calories from your weekly amount of extra calories, nothing else... Guess if I love this recipe!
