Description : 
 Didya know? There's a large population of Portuguese in Hawaii. Malasadas are the favorite donut of Hawaii. They are sold at carnivals every summer and many bakeries around the state. This is a poor imitation of a really good malasada... but it works when I can't go to the Punahou School Carnival to get my fix.
