 About New Potatoes : 
 
 New potatoes are tuberous vegetables harvested in early summer when they are small and immature, have sweet, tender white flesh. Most are red-skinned. Yellow-skinned new potatoes are also available. Choose firm, well-shaped potatoes, without sprouts or a greenish cast. 
 In Scandinavia, especially Sweden and Finland, newly harvested, early ripening varieties are considered a special delicacy. Cooked and served with dill, these "new potatoes" are traditionally consumed together with pickled Baltic herring.
 A traditional Canary Islands dish is Canarian Wrinkly Potatoes or Papas arragudas.
 If a dish is too salty, one quick remedy is to add one or two large potatoes which will absorb the salt. After 20 minutes, the potatoes could be removed.
