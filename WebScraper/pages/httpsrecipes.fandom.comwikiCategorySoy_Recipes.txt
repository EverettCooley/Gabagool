In this article we are going to talk about the importance of the soy products and the soy recipes in our life. It is well known that the heart disease is the number one death cause in the western world, especially in the US. According to the American Heart Association 40.1% or 1 out of every 2.5 deaths is caused by some form of cardiovascular disease. The majority of these heart disease can, however, be prevented. For example, the primary risk factors are: smoking, high blood pressure and elevated serum cholesterol and the secondary ones are: physical inactivity, obesity, uncontrolled blood glucose levels and poor dietary choices. All these factors can be eliminated by anyone from their system. In October 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a health claim for the soy protein. Specialists claimed that 25 grams of soy protein per day significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Usually the soy products have their health claim specified on their packaging. The soy recipes also mention the amount of soy protein that is needed in the body, which should be of at least 6.25 grams per serving. The simplest soy dish is the soybean, which needs to be soaked in water for 2 or 3 hours before being cooked. The best way to cook soybeans is by using a pressure cooker. All the soy recipes advise you to use one because this way you will considerably reduce the cooking time and the beans will be softer. Of course, you can always try the canned soybeans, but they are not so tasty as the home cooked ones. If you are a first timer in what soy recipes are concerned you should know that the soybeans have a nutritional value of 149 calories, 87 milligrams of calcium, 4.4 milligrams of iron, 14 grams of protein and 5 grams of dietary fiber per portion.
