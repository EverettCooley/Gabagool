 Description : 
 Chikanda  is a food that is cooked from a tuber, the size of small  potatoes , found in the wild.  
It is cooked with  peanut powder  and spices. In rural Zambia it is eaten with the nshima meal.  
In urban Zambia it is sold at markets eaten normally as a dessert or snack. The result is a  
delicious Chikanda sandwich to which you can add the usual optional  Cheese ,  Onion , or  lettuce .  
This is a vegetarian's delight and dream. 
 chinaka  Should be "Chikanda"
 Both names are valid. "Chinaka" is eastern province while "chikanda" is the original Bemba name.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 Cups grounded Chikanda tuber 
1 Cup grounded raw  peanut powder 
2 Cups  water  
1/2 Teaspoon  baking soda 
1/2 Teaspoon  salt 
1/4 Teaspoon red  cayenne pepper  (optional)
 
 Directions : 
 Pour two cups of  water  into a medium sized pot. Place on medium heat for two minutes. Add half a teaspoon 
 baking soda , half a teaspoon  salt , and quarter of a teaspoon red pepper. Stir until well dissolved. Add two  
cups ground Chinaka and one cup of raw  peanut powder  and stir slowly until thoroughly mixed. Contents will  
gradually boil, thicken, and sputter. Cover, lower heat, and cautiously stir every three to five minutes.  
Simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes. Remove from range and immediately empty the solid Chinaka on to a platter.  
Smooth the top of the chinaka with the back of a large spoon. Chinaka will thicken as it cools down. The chinaka  
should have the look of a large unsliced bologna. When cold, cut the chinaka into desired slices to be served  
as delicious sandwich cuts or served and eaten with other meals. Traditionally chinaka is eaten as dende,  
ndiwo or relish with the nshima Zambian staple food.
