      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 The "Vindaloo" style of cooking is of Goan origin - and is essentially a fiery-hot "sweet and sour" style  curry . It can be cooked with any meat - and tonight I'm doing it with  Chicken . I've never cooked this before - so I had to do some research. This dish involves a few more spices than usual - but they are easily obtained from your local Asian shop. The combined aroma of freshly roasted cinamon,  mustard seed  and cloves is heavenly.

       Ingredients     
 Ingredients : 
 Spices for dry-roasting : 
 (use the quantities as shown in the first picture):
 
 cloves 
 mustard seeds 
 cinnamon  (dal-chini) 
 The rest of the spices : 
 bay leaf 
 cardamom  pods 
 ground coriander 
 salt 
 turmeric 
 garam masala 
 red chile powder 
 garlic  and  ginger  pulp chunks from your freezer 
 2 "bullet" style  chile peppers  - one red, one green 
 a tub of  tamarind sauce  - which should be at least 60%  tamarind  (you can find these in the freezer section of the Asian store) - you will need a couple of generous scoops of this. 
 1 teaspoon of  sugar 
 And : 
 1 medium  onion  sliced into 5Â cm long pieces 
 3  chicken breast  fillets (around 400 grams) (i normally use thighs - but couldn't get hold of any tonight) 
 some "silverskin" style  pickled onions  - pickled in  white wine vinegar  (not  malt vinegar ) 
 half a tin of chopped  tomatoes  (for some reason i forgot to show this in the picture) 
 some freshly chopped  coriander leaf 
 Directions : 
 First get a small frying pan heating on the hob - no  oil . When the pan is hot - throw in the whole cloves, cinammon pieces and  mustard seeds . Dry roast them like this for a few mins - until they start to smell roasted - then pour the pieces into a small bowl and let them cool down. Then crush the roasted spices down - I use the base of a glass tumbler.
Meantime - get the  onions  frying in a little  sunflower oil .
 
         Grind the cloves, cinammon and mustard seed in a small bowl (using the bottom of a glass tumbler)     
         Stir-fry the onions     
 After a couple of mins - add the  bay leaves  and broken-up  cardamom  pods. Fry until the  onions  have browned. Then add the thawed  garlic  and  ginger  pulp - and stir fry for a few minutes more.
 
         Add the bay leaves and cardamon     
         Add the garrlic and the ginger pulp     
 When the  onions  have thoroughly browned - add the rest of the dried ground spices - 1 teaspoon  turmeric , 1 teaspoon  salt , 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 2 teaspoons  garam masala  - all heaped spoons except the  turmeric  - which should be just above a level teaspoon. Stir fry the mixture for around 5 mins gently.
 
         Onions should be browned     
         Add the ground spices and stir-fry     
 Then add the chopped  Chicken  pieces. And continue to stir fry until the  Chicken  is cooked all over the surface - and is thoroughly coated in the  Onion /spice mixture.
 
 
         Add the chicken pieces     
         Stir-fry until slightly browned     
 Then toss in the sliced bullet  peppers  - these are quite hot - but we want this dish to be quite fiery! Stir around for a few mins - and then add a couple of glasses of  water . This is the point at which you bring it to the boil - and then lower the flame so that the pot simmers (with the lid on) for about 20 mins.
 
         Throw in the sliced chillies     
         Add the water - and stir up     
 After about 20 mins of semi-aggressive simmering - the  Chicken  should be well cooked. Stir in a couple of large spoons of the  tamarind sauce  - and also a generous handful of the  pickled onions  - the  onions  are bursting with the juice of the  white wine vinegar  that was used to pickle them - and together with the tamrind sauce - will provide the "sour" edge. Immediately add a teaspoon of  Sugar  and also the half-tin of chopped  tomato  and the  coriander leaf . Let the pot simmer for 10 minutes more - and then let rest for 5 mins with the lid on.
 
         Add the pickled onions and 2 tablespoons of tamarind sauce     
         Add choped tomato and coriander leaf     
 It's done! Just serve up on a bed of freshly-cooked  basmati rice ! It sure was tasty - quite hot - but perfectly sweet/sour kind of hot. Delicious.
