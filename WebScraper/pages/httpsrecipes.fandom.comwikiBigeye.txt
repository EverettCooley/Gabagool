Most species reach a maximum total length of about thirty centimeters or twelve inches, although in a few species lengths of over fifty centimeters or twenty inches are known. Members of this family are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, where they tend to live near rock outcroppings or reefs, although a few are known to inhabit open waters. Some species are fished as a food fish. Bigeye fish has upper body blue-green and lower body silver with blunt head and large eyes.
