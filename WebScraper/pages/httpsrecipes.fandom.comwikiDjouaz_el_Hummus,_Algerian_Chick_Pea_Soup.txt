 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  chickpeas  soaked in  water  overnight 
 1 cup  green lentils  soaked in  water  overnight 
 1  onion  chopped 
 2 cloves of  garlic , minced 
 3 tablespoons of  tomato paste  or  tomato  jam 
 1 tablespoon of  cumin 
 1 teaspoon of  paprika 
 1 teaspoon  cayenne 
 olive  oil 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  chickpeas  in a pot of  water  for about one hour. 
 Add the  lentils  and cook for about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse the  chickpeas  and  lentils  under cool  water . You can remove the skins if you want, but an Algerian usually won't give up that extra bit of fiber. 
 Sauté the  onions ,  garlic  and  tomato paste  in olive  oil  for about 10–15 minutes. This will mellow the flavor of the  tomato  paste. 
 Add the  chickpeas ,  lentils , spices and about 1 tablespoons of  salt  or more to taste. 
 Cover with  water , bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. 
 Some cooks like to gently mash the chick peaks. Serve with Kesra or Khobz.
