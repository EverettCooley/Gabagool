 Ingredients : 
 Filling
 
 1 large head  bok choy  [about 1 pound, 450g], stem removed and quartered 
 3 tablespoons  poppy seeds 
 1/4 teaspoon Chinese Szechuan peppercorns 
 2 medium  garlic  cloves [1/5 ounce total, 6g], peeled 
 fresh ginger , peeled and cut into a 3/4-inch [2 cm] cube 
 1 small  red onion  [about 2 ounces, 55g], peeled and quartered 
 1/2 cup crumbled  farmer cheese  [about 3 ounces, 85g] 
 1 teaspoon  chili powder 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt 
 1 stick  unsalted butter  [4 ounces, 110g] 
 Dough
 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour  [10 ounces, 280g] 
 1 cup  buckwheat flour  [5 ounces, 140g] 
 1 cup  water  [240ml] 
 all-purpose flour , for dusting 
 Directions : 
 To make the filling, cook the  bok choy  in a saucepan of boiling  water  for 5 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry.
 Pulverize the  poppy seeds  and peppercorns with a spice or  coffee  grinder.
 Drop the  garlic  and  ginger  through the feed tube of a food processor with the metal blade in place and the motor running and chop finely, about 5 seconds. Add the  Onion  and chop finely, about 10 seconds. Add the  bok choy ,  poppy seed  mixture,  Cheese ,  chili powder , and  salt  and process until combined, about 10 seconds.
 Brown the  butter  in a skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, about 4 minutes. Cool and strain through a sieve lined with cheesecloth. Add to the filling and process until combined, about 15 seconds.
 To make the dough, combine the flours in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. With the motor running pour the  water  through the feed tube and process until the dough forms a ball. Dust the ball with  flour .
 Cut the dough into 8 pieces, dust with  flour , and wrap 7 pieces in plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Roll out the remaining piece with a  Pasta  machine according to the manufacturer's instructions, down to the second lowest setting, dusting with  flour  occasionally to prevent sticking. Place the dough sheet between sheets of plastic wrap. Roll out the remaining dough in the same manner.
 Cut the sheets, 1 at a time, into 4 by 2 inch [10 by 5 cm] rectangles. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each rectangle. Brush the edges lightly with  water  and fold the rectangles over to make squares, pressing the edges to seal them well.
 Cook the dumplings in batches in a saucepan of simmering  water  until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain
