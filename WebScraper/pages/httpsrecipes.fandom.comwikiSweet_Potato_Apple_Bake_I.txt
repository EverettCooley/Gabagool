 Ingredients 
 2 lbs fresh  sweet potatoes 
 1½ lbs cooking  apples 
 ⅔ cup light  brown sugar 
 6 tablespoons  margarine 
 ½ cup  apple cider

 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon ground  ginger 
 Directions 
 Boil potatoes, cool, skin and slice ¼ inch thick. 
 Peel apples, quarter, core and slice ¼ inch thick. While combining other ingredients, keep apples in fruit juice to prevent discoloration. 
 In a small saucepan, bring sugar, margarine, cider, syrup, lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger to a boil. Reduce heat and cook mixture for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. 
 Drain apples well and pat dry. Arrange apples and sweet potatoes in a 9x13x2 inch casserole dish. Cover with sauce. Bake at 325 °F for 25 – 30 minutes, basting occasionally.
