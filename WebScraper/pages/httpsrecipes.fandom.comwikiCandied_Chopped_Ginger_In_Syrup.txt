 Ingredients : 
 fresh ginger  rhizomes (roots) 
 Sugar 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Scrape or pare the skin off the  ginger . 
 You can cut it into sections or buds for ease of handling. 
 Cut in thin slices across the  grain . 
 Place slices in a food processor or blender and chop as fine as possible. 
 For each cup of packed, chopped  ginger , add 2 cups of  sugar  and 1 cup of  water . 
 Bring to a boil, turn down and simmer for about 20 minutes. 
 Cool and package in jars or plastic containers with lids. 
 I like to keep a cup or two at a time in the refrigerator and freeze the rest in zipper freezer bags for later use. 
 Don't be surprised that because of the high  sugar  content, the mixture doesn't freeze solid. That's okay.
