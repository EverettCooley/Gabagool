 Cook Time : 50 minutes 
 Serves : 40 
 Ingredients 
 1½ cups  all-purpose flour 
 ¼ teaspoon  ground coriander 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1 tablespoon  caraway seeds 
 ½ teaspoon  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ cup  butter , cut into small pieces 
 ⅓ cup  low-fat milk 
 1  egg white , slightly beaten 
 Directions 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 In a large bowl or food processor, combine flour, coriander, cumin, caraway, baking powder and salt. 
 Add butter pieces a little bit at a time until incorporated. 
 Add milk and continue mixing until it forms a doughy consistency. 
 If mixture is too dry, add a tablespoon or more of milk. 
 Transfer dough to a floured surface and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand. 
 Let sit for about 10 minutes to rise then using a floured rolling pin, flatten dough to about ⅛-inch thick. 
 Use a 2-inch diameter rounded or squared cookie cutter to cut out shapes. 
 Place cut-out crackers onto an ungreased cookie sheet. 
 Using a pastry brush, brush the surface of each cracker with egg white then prick the surface with a fork and bake for 15–20 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. 
 Use a spatula to remove crackers and cool completely on a rack. 
 Store crackers in an airtight container.
