Ingredients
 2 1/2 ounces shiitake mushrooms—stemmed, caps thinly sliced
 2 tablespoons soy sauce
 2 tablespoons canola oil
 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
 3 cups cooked sushi rice
 5 ounces firm tofu, sliced
 2 teaspoons unagi sauce (optional)
 1/3 cup shelled edamame
 5 ounces Manchego cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)
 1/2 cup soy bean sprouts
 Kosher salt
 Togarashi and toasted white and black sesame seeds, for sprinkling
 1 cup large bonito flakes
 6 shiso leaves, thinly sliced
 1/4 cup cilantro leaves
 How to Make It
 Step 1    
 Preheat the oven to 375º. In a bowl, toss the mushrooms and soy sauce. Let stand for 5 minutes; drain.
 Step 2    
 In a 9-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet, heat the oils. Press the rice into the skillet, about 1/4 inch thick. Cook over moderately high heat until the bottom is golden, 10 minutes. Top with the tofu in a single layer and drizzle with unagi sauce. Top with the shiitake, edamame, cheese and bean sprouts and season with salt. Sprinkle with togarashi and sesame seeds.
 Step 3    
 Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake on the top shelf for 15 minutes, until the top is golden. Slide the pizza onto a platter; top with the bonito, shiso and cilantro and serve.
