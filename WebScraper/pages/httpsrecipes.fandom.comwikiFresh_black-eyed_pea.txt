 About Fresh black-eyed pea : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Fresh Black-eyed pea on Wikipedia 
 The black-eyed pea, also called black-eyed bean, blackeye, field peas, lobiya or chawli, is a subspecies of the cowpea, grown for its medium-sized edible bean, pale-colored with a prominent black spot. Its currently accepted botanical name is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the "Frijol ojo de cabra" ("Goat's eye bean") of Northern Mexico are sometimes incorrectly called "black eyed peas" and vice versa.
