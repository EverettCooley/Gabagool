 1 cup  peanut butter 
 1  egg 
 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 ½ cup  water 
 ½ teaspoon  salt

 Roll dough out onto a lightly floured surface till about ½ inch thick. 
 Then cut out the biscuits using a cookie cutter — but mom uses a dogbone cutter but any neat cutter will do (or make squares). 
 Put the biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet. 
 Bake 15 mins for the smaller sized cookies and up to 35 mins. 
 For larger shaped ones. 
 Store in the fridge. 
 If they last that long!!!!!!!!!
