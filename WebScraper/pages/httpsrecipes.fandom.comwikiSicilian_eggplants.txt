 About Sicilian eggplants : 
 Sicilian eggplant is a specie of eggplants, which is characterized by a tender flavor and a sweet taste, similar to the regular Italian eggplant, found on these territories. Due to its valuable nutrients and vitamins (A, B and C) and the fact that it is very low in calories, the Sicilian eggplant is used in both vegetarian dishes and as healthy main courses. Although the edible part is actually an over-sized fruit or berry, the eggplant is prepared as a veggie, due to its taste, which varies from mild and creamy to sweet and bitter. 
 The Italian recipes that are featuring the Sicilian eggplant are represented by the most popular: the eggplant lasagna, the baked eggplant with cheese Sicilian style, the Sicilian eggplant casserole, the Sicilian eggplant burger and the roasted eggplant with herbs and spices. The Sicilian eggplant lasagna is prepared with large Sicilian eggplants (which are peeled and lengthwise sliced), fresh basil, pasta sauce, diced tomatoes, parmesan, mozzarella, chili flakes, cottage cheese, al dente lasagna, oil and garlic powder.
