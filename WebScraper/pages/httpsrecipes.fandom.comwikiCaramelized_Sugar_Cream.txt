Description : 
 In Romanian: crema de zahar ars
 
 Ingredients : 
 6  eggs 
 6 tablespoons  sugar 
 3 cups  milk 
 3 tablespoons of  sugar  for caramelizing 
 vanilla  (stick) 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Boil the  milk  with  vanilla  at slow heat. 
 After the first boil, cover and keep aside. 
 Beat the  eggs  with the  sugar  and the latter dissolves. 
 Heat the  milk  again, add a little  salt  and pour, a little at a time, into the  egg  and  sugar  mixture, constantly stirring, until it is almost cool. 
 Take a 3 qt pan and put 3 tablespoons of  sugar  in it. 
 Heat until the  sugar  melts and becomes yellowish. 
 Remove from heat and tilt the pan in such a way, that the melted  sugar  spreads all over the interior walls of the pan. 
 Stir the  cream  a little and then pour into the pan. 
 Cover and set this pan into a larger pan filled with boiling  water . 
 The boiling  water  must be ¾ of the height of the pan with the  cream . 
 Keep on medium heat for 25 – 30 minutes. 
 The  cream  is ready when it comes off the pan walls quite easily. 
 Remove from the  water  and keep in a cool place. 
 After it has cooled completely, refrigerate. 
 Before serving, take a large round plate and cover the pan with it. 
 Then turn the pan upside down.
