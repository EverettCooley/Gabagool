 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons  granulated sugar 
 1 teaspoon  baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1 1/2 cups  buttermilk 
 2 large  eggs , separated 
 1 tablespoon grated  lemon peel 
 1/3 cup part-skim  ricotta cheese 
 salad oil 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, mix  flour ,  Sugar ,  baking soda , and  salt . In a medium bowl, whisk  buttermilk ,  egg  yolks, and  lemon peel  to blend. Stir  buttermilk  mixture into  flour  mixture just until evenly moistened. Gently stir in  ricotta cheese . 
 
 
 In a bowl, with a mixer on high speed, beat the  egg  whites until soft peaks form. With a flexible spatula, gently fold the whites into the batter just until they are incorporated. 
 
 
 Place a nonstick griddle or a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat (350 degrees F). When hot, coat lightly with  oil  and adjust heat to maintain temperature. Drop batter in 1/2-cup portions onto the griddle and cook until pancakes are browned on the bottom and edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes; turn cakes with a wide spatula and brown other sides, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes longer. Coat pan with more  oil  as necessary to cook remaining pancakes. 
 
 
 Serve pancakes as cooked, or keep warm in a single layer on baking sheets in a 200 degree F oven for up to 15 minutes. 
 
 
 Makes about 8 pancakes.*
