Cake  is a form of food that is usually sweet and often baked. Cakes normally combine some kind of  flour , a sweetening agent (commonly  sugar ), a binding agent (generally  egg , though gluten or starch are often used by lacto-vegetarians and vegans), fats (usually  butter ,  shortening , or  margarine , although a fruit pur√©e such as  applesauce  is sometimes substituted to avoid using fat), a liquid ( milk , water or fruit juice), flavors and some form of leavening agent (such as  yeast  or  baking powder ), though many cakes lack these ingredients and instead rely on air bubbles in the dough to expand and cause the cake to rise. Cake is often frosted with  buttercream  or  marzipan , and finished with piped borders and crystallized fruit.
 Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions, particularly weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.
