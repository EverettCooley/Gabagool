 Description : 
 This is an incredibly easy recipe but it makes a delicious snack to enjoy with a glass of wine. I poached the idea from a Tapas restaurant that I used to work in. Spread on baked Turkish bread or Pizza Bianca.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 slab of  feta  cheese 
 1 ripe  roma tomato 
 1 small  chilli 
 ½ small  red capsicum 
 ¼ small  red onion 
 a pinch of  oregano 
 extra-virgin  olive oil 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 200 °C. 
 Slice the capsicum, tomato and the red onion thinly. 
 Place the slab of feta in a shallow, oven proof dish. 
 Arrange the whole chili, sliced tomato, capsicum and onion around and on top of the Feta. 
 Sprinkle with oregano, salt and pepper. 
 Add a very liberal dash of olive oil (approximately 2 tbsp). 
 Cook for around 10 minutes or until the texture of the cheese is soft and creamy.
