 About Cremini mushroom : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Cremini mushroom on Wikipedia 
 Although sometimes described as a sub-variety of the portobello mushroom, the crimini or cremini mushroom is actually an immature portobello. In fact, savvy marketers have begun to refer to crimini mushrooms as baby portobellos. Left to grow another 48 to 72 hours, a crimini mushroom will more than quadruple in size, taking on the large-capped portobello shape. They are more delicate in texture but still have the meaty portobello flavor.
 Cremini mushrooms, similar in size, and shape to the common, cultivated, white mushrooms, have a more pronounced flavor and a rich, brown skin concealing creamy, tan flesh. Simply select firm, plump mushrooms that are not slimy or bruised. Store mushrooms wrapped in paper towels or in a paper bag, never in plastic within the refrigerator.
