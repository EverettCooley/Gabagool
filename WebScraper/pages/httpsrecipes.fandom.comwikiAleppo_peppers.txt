 About Aleppo pepper : 
 The Aleppo pepper (Arabic: فلفل حلبي‎) is a variety of  Capsicum annuum  named after the town Aleppo in northern Syria. Most Aleppo peppers are grown in Syria.
 It has a moderate heat level with some fruitiness and mild, cumin-like undertones. The most common form found is crushed flakes, which are typically slightly milder and more oily than conventional crushed red peppers, with a hint of saltiness and a slightly raisin-like flavor.
 Aleppo peppers can be used to provide flavor and body to soups, stews, and sauces. Crushed Aleppo peppers can be used as a substitute for crushed red peppers or paprika.
 Aleppo pepper usually refers to the dried and coarsely ground spice, produced in Syria.
