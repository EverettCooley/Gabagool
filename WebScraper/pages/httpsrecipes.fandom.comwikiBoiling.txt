 Pasta : 
 Fill water in your pot and turn the stove on high. Set a timer for about 3 – 10 minutes depending on the amount of water you put in, the less water you put in the faster it takes to cook. When the water is boiling, quickly add the pasta of your choice. 1 – 2 minutes before the water is boiling, add 1½ tablespoons salt to about 3 – 4 quarts of the water.
