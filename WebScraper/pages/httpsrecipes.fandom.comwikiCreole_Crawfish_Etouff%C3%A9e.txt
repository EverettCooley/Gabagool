 1 small can diced Rotel™  tomatoes 
 2 cups  water 
 3 lbs of cleaned  crawfish  meat 
 1 tsp each  salt ,  pepper ,  garlic powder 
 dash of  cayenne 
 1 cup finely chopped  green onion  tops for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Make a roux by browning "slowly" in a small iron skillet ¼ cup  oil  and ¼ cup  flour  until it is dark brown. 
 Do not rush this. 
 Add chopped white  onions  and  bell pepper . 
 Next add Rotel™  tomatoes ,  water  and seasoning. 
 Stir very well over medium high heat. 
 Cover and reduce to low and simmer for about 15 minutes. 
 Add  crawfish  tail meat and raise heat to a slow boil. 
 Cook for about 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Take off the heat. 
 Cover and let set while you cook a pot of  white rice  (about 3 cups of raw  rice , 6 cups  water ,  salt , and  butter  ). 
 Serve over the 'cooked'  white rice  and garnish each bowl with  green onion . 
 This is so good with  garlic  bread and  potato  salad or cole slaw.
