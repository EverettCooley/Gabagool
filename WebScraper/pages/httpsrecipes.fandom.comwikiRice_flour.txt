 About Rice flour : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Rice flour on Wikipedia 
 Rice flour is of great importance in Southeast Asian cuisine. Also edible rice paper can be made from it. Most rice flour is made from white rice, thus is essentially a pure starch, but whole-grain brown rice flour is commercially available.
 Regular rice flour is a fine, powdery flour made from regular white rice. It's used mainly for baked goods. Glutinous or sweet rice flour (such as the Japanese Mochi) is made from high starch short-grain rice. It's widely used in Asian cooking to thicken sauces and for some desserts.
