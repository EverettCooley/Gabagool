 Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 The Super Easy Slacker way: 
 
 1 package of Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix (the dip mix has no dairy, but the dressing mix does have dairy, so be careful) 
 12.5 oz package of Mori-Nu firm  silken tofu 
 soy milk 
 
 *or* 
 
 The Spicy Ranch Dressing from Scratch Way: 
 
 1 1/4 cup veganaise 
 3/4 cup  soy milk 
 2 tbsp chopped  green onion 
 2 tbsp chopped fresh  parsley 
 1 tbsp  apple cider vinegar 
 1  garlic  clove, minced 
 1/2 tsp grated  lemon peel 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 
 SPICES: You should use between 1/8 and 1/4 of each of these, depending on how spicy or how peppery you want it: 
 
 garlic powder 
 Onion  powder 
 dried  thyme 
 dried  oregano 
 ground  black pepper 
 paprika 
 cayenne pepper 
 Directions : 
 SLACKER WAY: Blend the mix and  tofu  in a blender or food processor. Add enough  soy milk  to make it the right consistancy.. you might not want to add any if you'll be using it as a dip, but you'll need to add some to make it "pourable" as a dressing. Then just chill and eat!
 
 FROM SCRATCH: Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl until blended.
