 Description : 
 A "bhurji" is a term used to describe a dry-ish  masala  dish which is just a mixture of stuff in small pieces - e.g. pieces of paneer,  Potato  etc. A very commonly-eaten bhurji is the  egg  version - which is effectively a spicy scrambled  egg  dish - or more accurately is probably best described as a scrambled omelette comprising a  masala  of  eggs ,  potatoes  and  onions .
 I have to say that this is a really fast dish to knock up - and so we tend to cook this if we've left it too late to cook anything more involved - or if we cannot really be bothered to cook anything more involved! I also have to say that it's my absolute favourite on a cold and wet British spring day - exactly like it was tonight!
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 OK - this is where I need to point out that there are no hard and fast rules - you can use whatever ingredients you like - but at the very least do use potoatoes and  onions .
 
 5  eggs  - beaten - add some  milk  for extra volume if required. 
 The usual chunks  ginger , chillie,  garlic  from your freezer (thawed of course) 
 2 medium-sized  potatoes  peeled and chopped into pieces the size of, say, board-game dice 
 2 medium  onions  chopped the same way 
 2 (heaped) teaspoons ground coriander 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2 (heaped) teaspoons  garam masala 
 half teaspoon of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 Many people also add deseeded chopped  tomato  as well - but I didn't bother this time. 
 Directions : 
 First of all - get a large frying pan - heat up a couple of tablespoons of your usual  vegetable oil  in it - we use cholesterol-free  sunflower oil . Get the chopped  Potato  frying until they are golden brown on the surface.
 
       Fry chopped potatoes in a little oil     
         They should brown     
 Then add the chopped  Onion  to the pan - mixing it all about - and frying until the  Onion  is soft and translucent. At that point add the thawed pulp of  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie - be generous with the  garlic  and  ginger  - those spices are good for you - and please: (and this applies to all those of you out there who are afraid of the smell of  garlic ) DO NOT WORRY ABOUT  garlic  BREATH! - if you are cooking for your partner - or date - then they will get the same breath too - so there won't be any embarrassment later if/when you are kissing intimately.
 
 
         Then add chopped onions     
         The add ginger, chillie, garlic pulp     
 OK - when the  garlic ,  ginger  starts to show signs of  browning  a little - add the dry ground spices and give the whole pan a thorough coating of all the spices. The mixture in the pan will probably be quite dry by now - don't worry about that - keep it moving in the pan using a wooden spoon.
 
         Add the spices     
         Stir until coated     
 After a few mins - pour the beaten  eggs  into the pan - and leave everything alone until the  egg  starts to set. As the  egg  is setting - stir about infrequently and gently so that it breaks up - and once the  egg  as set completely the scrambled  egg  pieces wiill start to become coated in the spices as well. Keep everything stirring.
 
         Add the beaten eggs     
         Stir and break up as eggs start to set     
 Use your wooden spoon to break up and large  egg  pieces so that everything in the pan is roughly the same size. When it's done - keep to one side - but keep warm - and get some toast or pitta bread warmed up - or if you are feeling a bit adventurous like myself and Mrs.79 were tonight: make some fresh roti (chappati) and pickle - and then simply place the frying pan at the dining table and share the eating experience right out of it! This is great - because not only do you cut down on the washing up - but the  egg  bhurji stays warm on the surface of the previously hot frying pan!
