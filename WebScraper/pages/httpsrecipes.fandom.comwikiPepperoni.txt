      Pepperoni     
 About pepperoni : 
 An Italian salami made of  pork  and  beef  and highly seasoned with authentic black and red  pepper . This slender, firm, air-dried  sausage  is ready to eat, often sliced very thin, and simply used as an appetizer. It can also get used to add flavor to the many fresh, cooked dishes, as those who normally love pepperoni  pizza  will attest.
