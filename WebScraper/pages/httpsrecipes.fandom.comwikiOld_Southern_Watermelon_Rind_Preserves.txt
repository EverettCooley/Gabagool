Ingredients : 
 6 cups  watermelon  rind, diced 
 4 1/2 cups  sugar 
 1  lemon , sliced thinly, then seeded 
 1 teaspoon  allspice  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Peel green skin off the watermelon, but leave a little of the red pulp on rind. 
 Cut into 1-inch slices, then slice into 1-inch cubes. 
 Place rind in a large pot and cover with the sugar. (Bavilacqua's mother always said to cover it until the fruit doesn't show.) 
 Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight. This draws out the juices.. 
 Place pot on stove and add lemon slices and allspice, if desired. 
 Boil whole mixture until rind is clear, about 2 hours. 
 Pack into clean, hot jars. Wipe rims and screw on lids. Process 10 minutes in boiling water deep enough to cover lids by at least 1 inch. 
 Serve the preserves on buttered toast, if desired. 
 
 
 Notes : 
 After cutting watermelon, save the rind in the refrigerator until you are ready to prepare the preserves.
