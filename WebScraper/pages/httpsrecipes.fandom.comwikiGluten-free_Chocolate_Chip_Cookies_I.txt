Ingredients : 
 1  egg , beaten 
 ¼ cup  canola oil 
 1 (4-oz) jar strained baby fruit or 1 mashed  banana 
 1 teaspoon gluten free  vanilla 
 1 cup instant baby  brown rice  cereal 
 ¼ cup  quinoa flour 
 ¼ cup  brown sugar 
 1 teaspoon gluten free  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¾ teaspoon  cinnamon  + ¼ cup white  raisins   or  ¼ cup  chocolate chips  + ¼ cup chopped  macadamia nuts 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, mix the first 4 ingredients together. 
 In another bowl, mix the next 5 ingredients. 
 Combine, then add: either  cinnamon  and  raisins  or  chocolate chips  and  macadamia nuts . 
 The dough may be a bit sticky. Oil your hands slightly if necessary. 
 Use a balled-up paper towel to spread  canola oil  on a cookie sheet. 
 Do not discard. 
 Roll dough into small balls (1-inch), and place on the cookie sheet. 
 Use the oiled paper towel to flatten the dough, or use oiled fingertips. 
 Flatter means crispier - experiment with size and shape!. 
 They will not spread, so small and flat usually comes out the best. 
 Bake for 20–25 minutes. 
 They will be perfect when bottoms are lightly browned. 
 These look and taste almost exactly like the regular kind, and are worth the effort.
