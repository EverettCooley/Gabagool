 Vernonia is a large genus of plants in the family Asteraceae, named for English botanist William Vernon. Some species are sometimes known as ironweeds. Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers.
 Common names for these species include bitterleaf, ewuro, ndole and onugbu. They are common in most West African and Central African countries. They are one of the most widely consumed leaf vegetables of Cameroon, where they are a key ingredient of ndole stew. The leaves have a sweet and bitter taste.
