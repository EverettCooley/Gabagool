 Description : 
 Purchased from the McDonald Estate in Wylie, Texas in 1990. Dated 1944. Notation on card indicates this is a family favorite Sunday dinner opener. I made this and thought it was “good”, not “great” but I’m not big on  asparagus  so might not be the best person to judge it. My sister and sister-in-laws love it.

 1 pound fresh  asparagus 
 3 cups  chicken broth 
 2 tablespoons  flour 
 3 tablespoons  unsalted butter 
 2  egg   yolks 
 ½ cup  heavy cream 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  white pepper

 Cut  asparagus  in small pieces.

 Add to soup.
