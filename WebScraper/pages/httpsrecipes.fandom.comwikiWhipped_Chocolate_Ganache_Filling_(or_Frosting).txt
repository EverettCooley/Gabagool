       Whipped Chocolate Ganache Filling (or Frosting)     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  all-purpose flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 1 tablespoon  powdered sugar 
 4  egg  whites, at room temperature 
 1 cup skim  milk 
 ½ teaspoon  vanilla extract  or  butter  flavoring (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Place chopped  chocolate  in a medium-sized bowl. 
 Heat  heavy cream  and  sugar  (if using) in a large heavy saucepan over med-hi heat until it simmers gently. 
 Immediately pour the hot  cream  over the  chocolate  and stir gently until the  chocolate  is mostly melted. 
 Let stand for 15mins to be sure all  chocolate  is melted. 
 Stir ganache gently until perfectly smooth, let cool. 
 Cover and chill for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight (it must be very cold or it will curdle when it's whipped; ganache can be made up to 4 days ahead). 
 When you're ready to assemble the cake (and not before), whip ganache until it's stiff enough to hold a nice shape and seems spreadable (don't overwhip; overwhipped ganache looks granular, so watch carefully). 
 Spread whipped ganache immediately, as it will firm as it sits. 
 Note: if using 50-60%  bittersweet chocolate , use 8 oz of  chocolate  and omit the  sugar ; if using 60-64%  chocolate , use 7 oz of  chocolate  and omit  sugar ; if using 66-72%  chocolate , use 6 oz and add the optional  sugar  to give the ganache a bit of'lift'. 
 If you're just using this as a filling, halve the recipe. 
 If you're glazing the cake with a  chocolate  glaze, chill the filled cake for at least 1 hour (up to 2 days) before glazing.
