 Ingredients : 
 enough  lettuce  leaves for 4 people (use  butter lettuce ,  red-  or  green-leaf lettuce ) 
 1 tbsp  sugar 
 1 tbsp  vinegar 
 about Â½ cup  sour cream 
 fresh  chives , cut fine  or  finely sliced  onions 
 salt 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Wash and drain  lettuce . 
 Stir other ingredients together and pour over the  lettuce . 
 Mix lightly. 
 A sliced  hard-boiled egg  may be used as a garnish if desired, to be fancy or give it more body. 
 This salad won't keep long. 
 It should be served at once or the  lettuce  will wilt and be miserable. 
 Don't use the  iceberg lettuce  in this recipe, if you can help it. Use the kind listed in the ingredients. Only if they aren't available, then you may use the iceberg.
