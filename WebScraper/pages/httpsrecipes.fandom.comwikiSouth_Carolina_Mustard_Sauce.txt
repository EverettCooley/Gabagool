 Description : 
 This golden, homemade barbecue sauce is made with real mustard, vinegar, sugar, and spices and is absolutely great for marinating or dipping, as it keeps a sour, white-hot taste with the other condiments based in South Carolina, simply used for fresh meats, seafood, or poultry. Hot sauce or chili powder occasionally works for this too.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup yellow mustard 
 ¾ cup cider vinegar 
 1 tablespoon brown sugar 
 1 ½ tablespoon unsalted butter 
 2 teaspoons salt 
 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
 2 teaspoons hot sauce, to taste 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan. Whisk to combine occasionally while simmering for 20-30 minutes. 
 Let cool before using. Spoon, funnel, or pour contents into the fresh container then reserve this in the refrigerator.
