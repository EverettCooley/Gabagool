 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  milk 
 9 ounces  cornmeal 
 1 cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Heat  water  in saucepan. While  water  is being heated, mix half of the  cornmeal  with  milk  in jug until it forms a smooth paste. You will need to mix vigorously. 
 Carefully add the mixture to the boiling  water  and stir. Gradually add the remaining  cornmeal  and allow to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Mixture will get heavier and form a mash. 
 Remove it from saucepan and put into large bowl. You may shape it into a large ball by hand before serving. Make sure hands are slightly wet so that the mixture does not stick to them. 
 Serve with meat or stew.
