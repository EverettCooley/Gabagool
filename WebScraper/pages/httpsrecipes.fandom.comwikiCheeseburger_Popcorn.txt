Ingredients
 
 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
 
 2 slices bacon, diced
 
 2 tablespoons beef trimmings, diced, or substitute 1 tablespoon rendered beef fat
 
 1 teaspoon mustard powder
 
 1 teaspoon tomato powder
 
 1 teaspoon worcestershire powder
 
 1 teaspoon onion powder
 
 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
 
 1/2 teaspoon smoked salt
 
 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
 
 1/4 cup cheddar cheese powder (or go rogue and use a cheese packet from a box of mac and cheese, just don't forget the next time you want to make mac and cheese)
 
 Directions
 
 In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, add the diced bacon and beef trimmings.
 
 Cook until the fat has rendered and the bacon and beef bits are crispy, 8-12 minutes.
 
 Strain through a fine mesh colander into a bowl and reserve the fat.
 
 In a clean, small skillet over medium-low heat, toast the mustard powder, tomato powder, worcestershire powder, onion powder and sesame seeds until aromatic, 3-5 minutes. Set aside.
