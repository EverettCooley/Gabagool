Ingredients : 
 ½ cup of  butter 
 1 teaspoonful of  vanilla extract 
 1 cup of powdered  sugar 
 ¼ teaspoonful of  almond extract 
 2  eggs 
 2 tablespoonfuls of  milk 
 blanched  almonds , cut in halves 
 2 cups of  flour 
 Directions : 
 First  cream  the  butter  and gradually beat in the  sugar . 
 Reserve the white of one  egg  to glaze the cakes. 
 Beat the  yolk  of this  egg  and the other whole  egg ; add to the creamed ingredients with the  milk ,  flour  and flavoring. 
 More  flour  may be needed. 
 The dough must be stiff enough to hold its shape when baked. 
 Take a little of the dough onto a floured board, turn it in the  flour  with a knife, then knead slightly and with the rolling pin roll into a thin sheet. 
 With a French patty cutter stamp the dough into rounds and stamp each round with the same cutter again, to divide each into a crescent and an oval shaped cake. 
 Set these on buttered baking pans. 
 Press upon each three halves of  almonds , then brush over with the white of  egg , reserved for the purpose, and sprinkle the whole with  granulated sugar . 
 Bake in a quick  oven  to a pale straw color.
