Raspberry vinegar is a flavoured vinegar made from raspberry juice, vinegar and sugar.
 It is made by filling jars with raspberries, adding vinegar and leaving to stand for 8-10 days then pouring off all the liquid. This process is sometimes repeated several times with fresh fruit each time. Finally the liquid is boiled for 5 minutes with an equal weight of refined sugar.
