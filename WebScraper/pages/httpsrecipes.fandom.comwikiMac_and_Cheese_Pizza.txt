INGREDIENTS
 1 box macaroni and cheese, plus ingredients called for on box
 1 c. shredded cheddar, divided
 1 c. shredded mozzarella, divided
 1 lb. pizza dough
 Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing
 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning
 kosher salt
 Freshly ground black pepper
 Freshly chopped parsley, for serving
 DIRECTIONS
 
 Preheat oven to 450° and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  
 Prepare macaroni and cheese according to package instructions, then add ½ cup cheddar and ½ cup mozzarella to the pot. Stir until cheese is melted.  
 Stretch and roll pizza dough into a large round, about 12” wide. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder. Bake until the crust begins to turn golden, about 10 minutes.  
 Spread the macaroni and cheese on top of the baked crust in an even layer, leaving a ½” border for the crust. Top with remaining cheddar and mozzarella and bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden, about 10 minutes more.  
 Garnish with parsley and serve warm.
