Description : 
 Serves 2 quite generously. Delicious with freshly steamed  jasmine rice  — or  sticky rice  — to soak up the dressing.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  green mango , peeled and julienned 
 1  apple , sliced 
 1 crisp  Asian pear , sliced 
 a good handful of  grapes , seeded if necessary 
 8  cherry tomatoes , halved if large 
 big handful of  long beans  in 2-in segments 
 big handful of roasted  peanuts ; dried  shrimp 
 big handful of Thai "globe"  eggplants , quartered and soaked 1 hour in  salt   water , then rinsed (optional) 
 2  garlic  cloves, unpeeled 
 6 tiny  Thai chiles 
 3 tbsp  fish sauce 
 1 tbsp palm or  coconut sugar  (substitute dark or  light brown sugar  — but moderate  lime juice  in this case) 
 3  limes , sliced vertically around the "core" into seedless quarters (alternately, juice them) 
 Directions : 
 In a mortar and pestle pound the  garlic  and chilies and then add  sugar , fish sauce, and  limes  (if using juice, add a bit now and a bit as you go along, to avoid splashing the dressing into your face!). 
 Pound again. 
 Add  long beans  and pound only to bruise, not to mash; follow with mangoes and  tomatoes . 
 At this point use one hand to mix with a large spoon while pounding with the other. 
 Add fruits, pound and mix. 
 Taste for salt-sweet-sour-hot, and adjust seasonings as necessary. 
 Place on a plate and sprinkle with  peanuts  and  shrimp  (alternately, pound a few of the  shrimp  and leave the rest for garnish).
