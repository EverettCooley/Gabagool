 Ingredients : 
 1/3 cup whole unsalted  almonds 
 2/3 cup multibran or whole- grain  cereal squares 
 1/2 cup low-fat granola cereal without  raisins 
 1/4 cup  dried apricot  halves, cut into strips, or golden  raisins 
 1/4 cup sweetened dried  cranberries 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 F. Spread the  almonds  in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted, stirring once or twice to ensure even baking. Transfer to a plate to cool completely. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients. Stir in the cooled  almonds .
 Cook's Tip: If all the snack mix isn't likely to be eaten on the day you make it, we recommend using the golden  raisins . The moisture of the  dried apricots  may cause the cereal to lose its crispness over time. Be sure the  almonds  are completely cooled when you add them to the mix; otherwise, they will make it soggy.
