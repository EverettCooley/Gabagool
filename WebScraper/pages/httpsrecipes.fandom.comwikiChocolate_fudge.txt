 Place all ingredients (except marshmallows) into a large heavy pan prepare a plate/pan by spraying with  butter  flavored vegetable spray. (i used a small cookie sheet) measure the marshmallows and set aside. Place the pan on the burner set to the hottest setting. Mix and stir continuously when mixture comes to a full rolling boil, set the timer to 5 minutes and continue stirring. After 5 minutes remove the pan from the stove and continue stirring until mixture no longer boils. Add marshmallows and stir until marshmallows are melted and mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into prepared pan. The mixture is very stringy but after it sits for a few hours (fudging process) it gets the fudge consistency
