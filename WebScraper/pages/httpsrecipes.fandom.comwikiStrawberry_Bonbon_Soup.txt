Strawberry Bonbon Soup
 Makes 2 � cups - 4 servings
 Your best-loved fruit bonbon in a bowl. This soup is hard to beat. 
The chocolate sauce is speedy to prepare, but your jarred favorite 
from the supermarket works just fine. For a festive presentation, 
serve in a clear glass dessert bowl or a martini glass with a 
strawberry over the rim. 
 For the soup
 2 cups sliced strawberries 
1 cup plain yogurt 
� cup red grape juice or sweet and fragrant red wine, such as muscat 
1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste
 For the chocolate sauce
 1 ounce unsweetened baking chocolate 
1 teaspoon butter 
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup (see Tip) 
1 tablespoon cream or half-and-half
 To complete the recipe
 Sprigs of fresh mint and whole strawberries for garnish
 Pur�e all the soup ingredients in a blender. Adjust the sweetening to 
taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving. 
 Meanwhile, make the chocolate sauce. Stir the chocolate and butter in 
the top pan of a double boiler over simmering water until melted. 
Remove the top pan from the double boiler. Whisk in the maple syrup 
and cream until smooth. Serve immediately or set aside and bring to 
room temperature. 
 To serve, drizzle a swirl of chocolate sauce over bowls of the 
chilled soup and garnish with fresh mint and strawberries. 
 Advance preparation
This soup and the chocolate sauce will keep in separate covered 
containers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. When chilled, the 
sauce becomes firm; reheat in the microwave on high for about 30 
seconds, or until softened; stir before using.
