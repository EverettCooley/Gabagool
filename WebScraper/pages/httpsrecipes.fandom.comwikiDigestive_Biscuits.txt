 Description : 
 These are one of the most popular biscuits sold commercially in Britain. They are very delicate and, therefore, extremely difficult to reproduce exactly but this recipe is fairly close. The ORIGINAL recipe is posted, verbatim, below. However, please note that I used Pillsbury plain  whole wheat flour  (which I sifted) and I used 4 ROUNDED, not level, tablespoons of  wheat germ . These minor modifications were made as a result of the (always) invaluable advice and information I received from fellow chefs in a Recipezaar discussion forum. Biscuits will be 2 1/2 inch diameter x 1/8 inch thick.
 
       Digestive Biscuits     
 Ingredients : 
 11 ounces plain whole- wheat flour 
 4 tablespoons  wheat germ 
 1/4 teaspoon  baking soda 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt 
 2 tablespoons nonfat dry  milk  powder 
 4 tablespoons  Sugar 
 4 1/2 ounces  butter 
 5 tablespoons cold  water 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Combine the dry ingredients, and then cut in the  butter  so that the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. 
Combine the  water  and  vanilla  and drizzle over the dry mixture. 
Blend until the dough can be packed together. 
Roll out on a floured surface or between two sheets of waxed paper until the dough is about 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick. 
Cut into circles or other shapes and bake on a greased baking sheet at 170 °C/ 325 °F/ Gas Mark 3 for 20 to 25 minutes; make sure the oven does not get too hot- they should not be too brown. 
Cool and store in an airtight container at room temperature.
