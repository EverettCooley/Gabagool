 Description : 
 White or plain rice. Makes enough for 6-8 people.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups (about 1 liter) of  white rice 
 salt 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Unless the  rice  is pretty clean, you will want to rinse it before cooking it. 
 Put the  rice  and about 6 cups (or about 1½ liters) of  water  into a pot and place on high heat. (Some people prefer to boil the  water  and add the  rice  to boiling  water . This is fine too.) 
 Let the  rice  boil for about 10–15 minutes (the time will be less if you added the  rice  to the boiling  water ). 
 Some people prefer to drain the  rice , and others prefer to simmer it. 
 If you are draining the  rice , let the  rice  boil until it is soft enough to eat (try a few  grains ) but not so soft that it is sticky. 
 Then place in a sieve, and allow the excess  water  to drain out. 
 If you are simmering the  rice , allow the  rice  to boil but not until it is soft enough to eat. 
 Cover the pot with a lid, and turn the heat low. 
 Allow the  rice  to simmer for about 15–20 minutes...the  rice  should be soft enough to eat, not so soft that it is sticky, and there should be little or no  water  at the bottom of the pot by the time the  rice  is finished.
