 Description : 
 6 to 8 servings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 	medium  cucumber 
 6 	 radishes 
 4 	 green onions 
 2 	cups cream-style  cottage cheese 
 1/3 	cup  sour cream 
 1 	teaspoon  salt 
 1/4 	teaspoon  pepper 
 1 	dash red  cayenne pepper 
 lettuce  cups (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Cut  cucumber  lengthwise into fourths, then into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Cut  radishes  into halves and  onions  into 1 1/2-inch pieces. 
 Place vegetables in blender container; add enough  water  to cover. Cover and blend on high speed until finely chopped; drain completely. (Can use your food processor, or vegetables can be finely chopped by hand). 
 Mix  cottage cheese ,  sour cream ,  salt ,  pepper  and red pepper; stir in vegetables. 
 I like to cover and refrigerate for several hours to let the flavors blend. 
 Spoon into  lettuce  cups and, if desired, garnish with sliced  ripe olives .
