 Ingredients : 
 1 lb Dried white beans (navy or cannellini) 
 2  onions , chopped 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 3  bay leaves 
 2 tb Chopped  parsley 
 2 tb  tomato  paste 
 1 lg  carrot , scraped and sliced 
 5 To 6 whole peppercorns 
 1 lb Kielbasa, thickly sliced 
 1/2 tb  salt 
 2 tb  olive oil 
 1 ts  paprika 
 2 tb  flour 
 Directions : 
 You will need a large saucepan. 
Pick over the beans for bits of grit and chaff, and rinse them twice in cold  water .  
Put the beans in a large saucepan and cover them with  water  to a depth of 1 to 2 inches. 
Bring the  water  to a boil and then turn down the heat. 
Leave to simmer gently for half an hour. 
Remove the pan from the heat and pour in enough cold  water  to cover the beans to a depth of 3 inches.
The beans will settle on the bottom. 
Leave them for a minute or two; then pour off the  water  and replace with fresh  water . 
Bring the  water  to a boil and then turn down the heat to simmer. 
Add the  onions ,  garlic ,  bay leaves ,  parsley ,  tomato  paste,  carrot , and peppercorns to the beans. 
Cook gently over very low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the beans are soft. 
After 45 minutes of the cooking, add the kielbasa. 
Fifteen minutes before you are ready to serve, add the  salt  and prepare a liaison for the soup. 
Heat the  oil  until it is smoking lightly; then quickly stir in the  paprika , followed by the  flour . 
Mix to a thin paste. 
Add this to the soup, stirring well. 
Simmer for 5 minutes, until the soup is thick and rich.
