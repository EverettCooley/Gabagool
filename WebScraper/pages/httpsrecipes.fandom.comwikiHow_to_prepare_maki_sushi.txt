    1. Set down the Makisu. 
 
 
    2. On top of the Makisu, place a sheet of  nori  toward you.  nori  is sold in packages of square sheets - to make sushi you use half sheets such as the one pictured to the left.  Larger rolls can be made with a full sheet (dragon roll, rainbow rolls etc.) 
 
 
    3. Put some Shari on top of  nori . The amount of Shari you use should be about the same used to make three pieces of Maki-zushi. Shari is  sushi rice  (short grained  rice  with a  vinegar  mixture added to it while hot and mixed lightly until cool - ratios are Â½ cup  rice wine vinegar , 4 tbsp  sugar , 1 tsp  salt  mixture on top of 5 cups cooked  rice ). 
 
 
    4. Spread the Shari from left to right. 
 
 
    5. Leave about an inch of space on the bottom and the top of  nori  without any Shari . 
 
 
    6. Place a long, thin strip of Neta (sushi topping) on top of the Shari . Spread some  Wasabi  as well. Neta can be any of a wide assortment of ingredients - from raw fish, to  cucumber  to more western ingredients such as  cream cheese  and  lox . 
 
 
    7. Slowly lift the Makisu in order to roll it while keeping  nori  steady. 
 
 
    8. Make sure both left and right sides are even. 
 
 
    9. Roll it up forward. 
 
 
      10. Place both index fingers on the sides of Makisu and shape the maki-zushi into a square, or triangle, or leave it as a circular roll. 
 
 
    11. Cut the maki-zushi in half with a very sharp knife. Wet knife with cold  water  /  vinegar  mixture so it does not stick.  Ideally a Japanese knife would be best for this, as it is only sharpened on one side and does not drag across items it cuts. 
 
 
    12. Place them together and cut them into 6 pieces. 
 
 
    13. Done.
