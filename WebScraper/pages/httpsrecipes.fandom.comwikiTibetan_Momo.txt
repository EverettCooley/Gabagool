 Ingredients : 
 2 medium  onions , finely chopped 
 1 lb. Yak meat, finely chopped 
 2-5 cm. minced  ginger 
 2 tablespoons  soy sauce 
 3 cloves minced  garlic 
 salt  to taste 
 4 cups  flour

 Mix meat,  onion ,  garlic , soy sauce,  ginger  and  salt  together. 
 Put a teaspoon of meat mixture in each little pancake and fold over.
