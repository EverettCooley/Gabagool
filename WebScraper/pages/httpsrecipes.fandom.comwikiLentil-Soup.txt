 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  brown lentils 
 2 quarts  chicken stock  (or your choice) 
 1 large  onion , quartered 
 2 tablespoons  garlic , chopped or sliced 
 1 medium  tomato , quartered 
 2 tablespoons  butter , less if desired 
 1 medium  onion , sliced thinly 
 1 teaspoon  cumin , to taste 
 Directions : 
 Wash  Lentils  thoroughly and soak if desired. 
 I never soak them, and they always seem to cook up quickly. 
 Bring stock to a boil. 
 Add quartered  Onion ,  garlic ,  tomato  and  Lentils . 
 Return to boil, then lower heat and allow to simmer, partially covered, until  Lentils  are tender. 
 The amount of time will depend on the freshness of the  Lentils  and whether or not they were soaked, but plan on an hour to an hour and a half. 
 Over-cooking wouldn't be a problem since this is a blended soup, but under-cooking would. 
 As  Lentils  approach tenderness, melt  butter  in a small frying pan over medium-low heat. 
 Add thinly sliced  Onion  and allow to fry until very dark brown. 
 Add  cumin , saute briefly. 
 Add mixture to soup and stir through. 
 Ladle one ladle-full of soup at a time into a blender or food processor. 
 Using a dishtowel, hold lid down and process soup until homogenous. 
 When soup has been completely pureed, return to a pot and reheat until ready to serve.
