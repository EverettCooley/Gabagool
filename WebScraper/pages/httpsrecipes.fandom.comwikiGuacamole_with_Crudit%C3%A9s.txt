 Description : 
 This fresh, tasty and spicy dip is made using peas instead of the traditional avocados normally associated with guacamole. This version saves on both fat and calories without compromising taste.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2¼ cups frozen  peas , defrosted 
 1  garlic  clove, crushed 
 2  scallions , chopped 
 1 tsp. finely grated rind and juice of 1  lime 
 ½ tsp. ground  cumin 
 1 tbsp. reduced fat  mayonnaise  (or mayonnaise made with olive oil) 
 2 tbsp. chopped  cilantro   or   parsley 
 dash of  Tabasco sauce 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 pinch of  paprika  and lime slices, to garnish 
 Directions : 
 Put the peas, garlic clove, scallions, lime rind and juice, cumin, Tabasco sauce, mayonnaise and salt and black pepper into a food processor or blender for a few minutes and process until smooth. 
 Add the chopped cilantro or parsley and process for a few more seconds. Spoon into a serving bowl, cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes, to let the flavors meld. 
 For the crudités, assemble about half a dozen different "dippers." The bulk of the crudités should be vegetables, but make sure to include up to 2 different types of fruit. I suggest using a pear and a sweet red-skinned eating apple for your fruit and baby carrots, celery stalks and canned baby corn (you can usually find this in the aisle in your grocery store that specializes in ethnic food) for the veggies...but by all means, use whatever you'd like (and whatever would hold up well to dipping). 
 To serve, sprinkle the paprika over the guacamole and garnish with twisted lime slices. Place the bowl on a larger serving platter and fan out your sliced fruit and the vegetables. For a little something extra, you may serve the guacamole with warmed whole-wheat pita bread.
