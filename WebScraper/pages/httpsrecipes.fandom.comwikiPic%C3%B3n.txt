 About Picón : 
 Picón is a three-milk blue cheese from the mountains of Picos de Europa in the Northern region of Cantabria. It has a sticky, soft rind that is gray, with yellowish-green spots. The cheese itself is white with bluish-green veins running through it. It is particularly creamy and tangy, and was traditionally wrapped in leaves. Picón is aged for a minimum of 2 months in caves.
