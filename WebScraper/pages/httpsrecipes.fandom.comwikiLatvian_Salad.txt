 Ingredients : 
 ½ pound reduced fat  regular tofu (firm) , rinsed and patted dry (press if time permits) 
 Marinade : 
 2 Tbsp  red wine vinegar 
 1 Tbsp fresh  lemon juice 
 4 tsp  olive oil 
 ½ tsp dried  basil  leaves 
 ½ tsp dried  oregano  leaves 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp  garlic  granules 
 ¼ tsp ground  black pepper 
 Salad : 
 4 cups  romaine lettuce , torn into bite-size pieces 
 1½ cup  cucumber , sliced horizontally and cut into half-moon shapes (peel if waxed or thick-skinned) 
 1 ripe medium  tomato , cut in half and thinly sliced into half-moon shapes 
 ⅓ cup whole  black olives   or  Greek * ¼ cup chopped  red onion 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  tofu  into ¾ inch cubes, and place it in a wide, shallow ceramic or glass mixing bowl 
 In a small measuring cup or mixing bowl whisk together the ingredients for the marinade. 
 Pour the marinade over the  tofu  chunks, tossing them gently so that they are evenly coated. 
 Cover, marinate in fridge several hours or overnight. (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND 18 to 24 hours, and give them a stir whenever you go in the kitchen so they marinate evenly.) 
 Just before serving prepare the salad ingredients and place them in a large mixing bowl. 
 Add the  tofu  and marinade to the salad ingredients, and toss gently but thoroughly. 
 Serve at once, with  salt  and  pepper  on the side to season as desired.
