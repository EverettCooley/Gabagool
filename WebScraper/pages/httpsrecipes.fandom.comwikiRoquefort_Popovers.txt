 Description : 
 Most recipes call for pricking popovers as soon as they come out of the oven to prevent them from becoming soggy. These light and lacy popovers won’t need to be pricked. Use 2 mini-muffin pans with a nonstick finish so the popovers are easily freed from the cups. As noted in the recipe, you can reheat them but do not refrigerate, or they will become irreversibly soggy.
 
       Roquefort Popovers     
 Ingredients : 
 1 	 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 	teaspoon  salt 
 1/4 	teaspoon freshly ground  white pepper 
 1 	tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf  parsley 
 1 1/4 	cups  milk , at room temperature 
 2 	 eggs , at room temperature 
 1 	tablespoon  unsalted butter , melted 
 3 	ounces  Roquefort   Cheese  or other strong-flavored crumbly blue  Cheese , crumbled 
 Directions : 
 Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 450 °F. 
Generously brush two 12-cup mini-muffin pans with  vegetable oil . 
In a large bowl, whisk together the  flour ,  salt ,  white pepper  and  parsley . 
In a large measuring cup, whisk together the  milk ,  eggs  and  butter . 
Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and whisk together until just combined (don't worry if a few lumps remain). 
Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups to within about 1/4 inch of the rim (about 1 1/2 Tbs. each). 
Place a scant 1 tsp crumbled  Cheese  in the center of each filled cup. 
Bake for 10 minutes. 
Do not open the oven door during this time. 
Reduce the oven temperature to 350 °F and continue to bake until the popovers are brown and crusty and fully puffed, 8 to 10 minutes more. 
Remove from the oven and immediately transfer the popovers to a napkin-lined bowl or warmed platter. 
Serve immediately. 
Or, let cool on wire racks for up to 2 hours, then reheat in a 350 °F oven for 10 minutes.
