A small cut of meat taken from the rib section and including part of the rib. Pork, veal and lamb chops are the most popular 
 The process of cutting foods into fine or coarse cut pieces. Onions, carrots, sweet peppers, celery, tomatoes, and potatoes are all examples of foods that are coarsely chopped to be added to stews and chili. This can be accomplished manually with a knife or the food can be placed into an electric blender or food processor and chopped very quickly resulting in a cut to match the needs of the recipe. A chop differs from a dice or mince by its larger-sized cut.
 To coarsely chop is to cut food into small pieces, about  3 / 16  inches square.
