 The sweetness of papaya balances the spice of cayenne pepper in this 
Caribbean-inspired favorite. Wrap any leftovers in a wholewheat tortilla for a
quick next-day lunch.

 Serves : 6 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tsp  olive oil 
 1 cup chopped  red onion 
 ½ cup  orange juice 
 ¼ cup  lemon juice 
 2 Tbsp fresh chopped  cilantro 
 ½ tsp  cayenne pepper 
 1 cup finely chopped  red bell pepper 
 1 cup finely chopped  green bell pepper 
 1 medium  papaya , peeled, seeded, and diced 
 2  garlic  cloves, minced 
 2 15-oz can  black beans , rinsed and drained 
 6 cups  brown rice , cooked 
 Directions : 
 Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add all ingredients except beans and rice. 
 Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until bell peppers are crisp-tender. 
 Stir in beans. Cook about 5 minutes or until heated through. 
 Serve over rice. 
 Tips : 
 One large pepper equals one cup chopped. One medium onion equals one cup chopped. 
 Variations : 
 Reduce the number of ingredients needed. Use 2 cups of red peppers or 2 cups of green peppers instead of 1 cup of each. Use either lemon juice or orange juice instead of both. Lemon juice adds tartness while orange juice adds sweetness.
