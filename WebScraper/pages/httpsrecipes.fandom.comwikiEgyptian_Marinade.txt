 1/2 cup  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons ground  cumin 
 1 tablespoon ground coriander 
 1  Onion , grated 
 3 cloves  garlic , finely minced 
 1 teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste.

 If using boneless  Chicken  pieces, cut into 1-in cubes and place in a shallow non-aluminum container, or plastic zip top bag. You may use cut up  Chicken  pieces also. 
 Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl and pour over the  Chicken . Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. You can marinate for up to 48 hours if properly refrigerated. 
 Bring the meat to room temperature before cooking. While the meat is warming to room temp., prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat your oven broiler (griller) Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade. 
 If using  Chicken  cubes, thread on to skewers. Place the skewers or butterfield or halved birds on the grill rack or a broilerpan and grill or broil until cooked through, basting with reserved marinade while cooking. (use a kitchen brush or spoon). 
 Cooking time will depend upon the size of the poultry pieces; But do not let meat become dry. Watch the meat carefully. It may only take 1 hour for breast pieces and less for bonier pieces. Serve the broiled/grilled  Chicken  with pita bread &  lemon  wedges.
