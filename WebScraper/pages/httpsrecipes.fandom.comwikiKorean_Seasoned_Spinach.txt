Description : 
 She geum chi Namul (Seasoned Spinach)
 In Korea, every restaurant serves this as a side dish because its so easy to make -- and cheap. What spinach you don't use for the side dish can be saved and served as a cold midnight snack with mayonaisse. While growing up in Hawaii, I would kill any leftover spinach.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 bunch spinach (she geum chi) 
 1 tb soy sauce 
 1 tb sesame oil 
 2 tsp sesame seeds 
 1 tsp minced garlic 
 salt to taste 
 Directions : 
 Wash spinach very thoroughly. 
 Bring pot of water to boil. 
 Blanch the spinach by putting it in boiling water for 1 minute. 
 Remove and rinse in cold running water. Squeeze out excess water. 
 Chop spinach coarsely and place in a bowl. 
 Add remaining ingredients and mix by hand. Taste and add salt if needed.
