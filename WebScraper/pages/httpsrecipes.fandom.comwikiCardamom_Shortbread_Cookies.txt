 Ingredients : 
 1 1/3 cups (2 2/3 sticks)  unsalted butter  at room temperature 
 1/3 cup  Sugar 
 3  egg yolks 
 1 teaspoon  pure vanilla extract 
 2 1/2 cups  all-purpose flour , sifted 
 2 teaspoons ground  cardamom 
 1/8 teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium-high speed,  cream  the  butter  and  sugar  for 3 to 4 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add the  egg yolks  one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the  vanilla .
 
 In another bowl, whisk the  flour ,  cardamom  and  salt  together.
 
 Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the  flour  in a few additions until incorporated. Scrape the dough from the bowl and gather it into a mass. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour or as long as overnight.
 
 Preheat the oven to 350 °F.
 
 On a lightly floured surface, knead the chilled dough a few times to warm it up and make it pliable. With a floured rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick and 12 inches long. Using a small, sharp knife, cut the dough into the desired shapes. Lay on an ungreased baking sheet and prick the shortbread several times with a fork. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until lightly browned and firm.
 
 Transfer to wire racks to cool.
