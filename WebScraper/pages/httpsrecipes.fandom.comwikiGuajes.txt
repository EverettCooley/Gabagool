 About Guajes : 
 Guajes or huajes are the flat, green (or brown) pods of the  Leucaena spp .  The pods are sometimes light green or deep red in color -- both taste the same.
 Guaje seeds are small and turn brown as they age.  The seeds are eaten raw with guacamole, sometimes cooked and made into a sauce. They can also be made into fritters. The ground seeds are used to impart a slightly garlicky flavor to a mole (sauce) called guaxmole (huaxmole). The dried seeds may be toasted and salted and eaten as a snack referred to as "cacalas".
