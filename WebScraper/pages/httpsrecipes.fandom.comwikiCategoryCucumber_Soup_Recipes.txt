Together with different other vegetables, Cucumber is one of the main ingredients of several tasty soups that are enjoyed all over the world. Since Cucumber takes a short time to cook, it’s a favorite vegetable ingredient for many cooks and professional chefs. In many recipes you will notice that the Cucumber is only added towards the end of the preparation time – this is because it cooks rapidly and adding it late enables it to keep most of its nutritious elements. Often combined with chopped and minced veggies, Cucumber may be used in different shapes as part of a soup.
