Chocolate Toffee Crunch Squares 
 2 packages (11.5 oz. each) milk chocolate chips 
1 cup Toffee Bits 
1 cup salted peanuts 
1 cup halved pretzel sticks 
1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes, optional 
1/2 cup white chocolate chips 
1 teaspoon shortening(do not use butter, margarine, spread or oil) 
Paper candy cups, optional 
 Line 9-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Place
chocolate chips in large microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir. If necessary,
microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time,
stirring after each heating just until chips are
melted and mixture is smooth when stirred. Immediately
add toffee bits, peanuts, pretzels and coconut, if
desired; stir to coat.
 Spread mixture into prepared pan; cover with plastic
wrap or foil. Refrigerate 45 minutes or until firm.
 Place white chips and shortening in small
microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH 1 minute; stir.
If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15
seconds at a time, stirring after each heating just
until chips are melted and mixture is smooth when

chocolate mixture in pan. Cover; refrigerate 5 minutes
or until firm. 
 Bring to room temperature. Remove chocolate mixture
from pan and place on cutting board, top side up;
discard plastic wrap. Cut into 1-1/2 inch squares.
Place each square in a candy cup, if desired. Store in
covered container in a cool place. 
 About 3 dozen squares.
