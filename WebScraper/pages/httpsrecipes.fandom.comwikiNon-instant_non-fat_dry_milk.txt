 Storage : 
 Unopened Milk : 
 Store nonfat dry milk off the floor in a cool, dry place until ready to use.
 
 Opened Milk : 
 Store opened nonfat dry milk in a tightly covered container. When exposed to the air and moisture, it becomes lumpy and the flavor changes.
 After mixing with water, cover milk and refrigerate. Handle and treat the same as fresh fluid milk. Use within 3 to 5 days.
 
 Uses & Tips : 
 Use reconstituted nonfat dry milk in place of fresh  milk  in recipes such as  breads ,  cakes ,  soups ,  gravies ,  sauces ,  mashed potatoes , and  custards .
 
 Preparation : 
 When nonfat dry milk is specified in recipes such as bread,  biscuits ,  muffins , and cakes which contain large portions of dry ingredients, the nonfat dry milk may be mixed with the other dry ingredients. The water for reconstitution may be added to the liquid ingredients. 
 Use nonfat dry milk as directed in recipes requiring dry or reconstituted milk or as a substitute in a cooked product when fresh milk is specified. 
 Because this milk is non-instant, it does not mix easily for drinking purposes.
