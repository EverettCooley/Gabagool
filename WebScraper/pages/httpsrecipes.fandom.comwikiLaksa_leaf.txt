 About Laksa leaf : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Laksa leaf on Wikipedia 
 Vietnamese Coriander (Polygonum odoratum syn. Persicaria odorata, Polygonaceae) is a herb whose leaves are commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking. Other English names for the herb include Vietnamese mint, Vietnamese cilantro, Cambodian mint and hot mint. The Vietnamese name is Rau răm. In Malaysia and Singapore it is called daun kesom or daun laksa. It is not related to the mints, but the general appearance and odor are reminiscent.
 Above all, the leaf is identified with Vietnamese cuisine, where it is commonly eaten fresh in salads and in raw spring rolls (goi cuon). Bowls of pho (beef noodles) are also typically garnished with Vietnamese mint. It is also popularly eaten with hột vịt lộn, (known as balut in the Philippines).
 In Singapore and Malaysia, the shredded leaf is an essential ingredient of laksa soup, so much so that the Malay name daun laksa means "laksa leaf".
 In Australia the plant is being investigated for a source of essential oil (kesom oil).
