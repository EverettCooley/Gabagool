With the onset of Fall, many times the cooler weather seems to "creep" up on gardens and harvests that still need a little bit more growing time.  green tomatoes  - they worked so hard to get to where they are - but never had the chance to finish growing, and turn into that beautiful red globe that astonishes everyone as they wait for that wonderful sweet taste of a  vine-ripened tomato ! 
 Green tomatoes  are excellent fried, sauteed, or cooked in sauces or meat stews. Use small  green tomatoes  for pickling. Large, unblemished  green tomatoes  will ripen on a sunny window sill,or you can wrap them in newspaper and let them ripen slowly in a cool, dark place.
