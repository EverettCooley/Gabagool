Description : 
 I added the nutrition info to this... it is a Dr. Weil recipe that has been previously posted. It is quite yummy and a good dish to serve to guests or taken to a gathering. Take care, Gloria
 Traditional pates are often made from high-fat meats and liver. They can be delicious and quite elegant, but less than nutritious. This vegetarian version is sophisticated, filled with flavor, and healthful. Enjoy it on a special occasion or as an everyday spread with whole-grain crackers.
