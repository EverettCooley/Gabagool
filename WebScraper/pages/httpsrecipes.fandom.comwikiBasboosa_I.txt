Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  semolina ,  farina  or  cream of wheat 
 ½ cup desiccated  coconut 
 2 tbsp  baking powder 
 ½ cup liquid  butter  or  margarine 
 2  eggs 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 ½ cup plain  yogurt  (or canned thickened  cream ) 
 1 tsp  pineapple  flavoring or  vanilla flavoring  (optional)

 ½ cup  water 
 ¾ cup  sugar 
 the juice of half a  lemon  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl mix the  semolina ,  coconut  and  baking powder . 
 Knead in the liquid  butter  until it is well blended. 
 In a blender (or with a mixer or hand beater) blend the  eggs ,  sugar ,  yogurt  and flavoring. 
 Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. 
 Stir with a spoon until combined and pour immediately into a 9" by 13" ungreased cake pan. 
 If desired, decorate the top of the batter with the  nuts  so that there will be one nut in the middle of each piece (which is cut when removed from the oven) or sprinkle a little  coconut  on top instead. 
 Bake in a 350°F oven until done and nicely browned. 
 Over the hot cake pour cool syrup (recipe follows). 
 Allow to sit to absorb the syrup (a half an hour is good). 
 Cut, eat and enjoy!.

 In a small saucepan combine and boil for about 5 minutes the  water ,  sugar  and (optionally) the juice of half a  lemon .
