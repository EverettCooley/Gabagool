Description : 
 The literal translation of Shahi Paneer is ‘Royal Paneer’…very appropriate – A dish fit for a king. The richness of the sauce comes from the cashews.

 Add onions and fry until they start to dry out. 
 Add ginger, garlic and green chili and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

 While onions/tomato sauce is cooking, blend soaked cashews and milk in a blender until smooth. 
 Once onion/tomato mixture is ready, add cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala – mix well.
