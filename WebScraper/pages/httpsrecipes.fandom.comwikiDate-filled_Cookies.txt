 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ¾ cup  butter  or  margarine  (at room temperature) 
 1½ cups  sugar 
 2  eggs 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Filling : 
 8 ounces of pitted  dates , cut up 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 ¼ cup  lemon juice 
 ½ cup chopped  walnuts 
 Directions : 
 Sift the  flour  with the  baking powder  and  salt . 
 Set aside. 
 In a large bowl mix the  butter ,  sugar ,  eggs  and  vanilla  until light and fluffy. 
 Gradually stir in the  flour  mixture until it is all well combined. 
 Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate several hours or overnight. 
 Divide dough into four parts and refrigerate until ready to use. 
 Meanwhile, make the filling: in a small saucepan combine the  dates  and  sugar  with ½ cup of  water . 
 Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the mixture has thickened - about 5 minutes. 
 Remove from heat. 
 Stir in the  lemon juice  and  walnuts . 
 Cool completely. 
 On a lightly floured surface, roll dough, one part at a time, ⅛ inch thick. 
 With a floured 2½ inch cookie cutter (or the bottom of a glass), cut out cookies. 
 Re-roll trimmings and cut. 
 Using a spatula, place half of the cookies on a lightly greased cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. 
 Spread 1 teaspoon of filling over each cookie. 
 Cover with another cookie. 
 With a floured fork, seal the edges firmly. 
 Also, prick the center of the cookie once with the fork. 
 Bake in a 375°F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. 
 Remove to a wire rack, cool and enjoy!
