      Hot sauces     
 About hot sauce : 
 Hot sauce is a sauce with capsaicin as a primary ingredient. This is generally found in chili peppers, and even used in self-defense pepper spray (mace). Generally hot sauces are made using 4 or 5 ingredients: peppers, vinegar, onions, garlic and tomato sauce. Many manufacturers will promote their sauces by boasting about the relative heat and problems it may cause with digestive systems. 
 
 Heat : 
 Peppers and hot sauces are generally rated using the Scoville scale, or Scoville Heat Units (SHU). This measurement is found by extracting capsaicin and measuring how much water it takes to dilute the heat. Common peppers rate as follows:
 
 Bell peppers  - 0 SHU 
 Jalape√±o peppers  - 5,000 SHU 
 Serrano peppers  - 15,000 SHU 
 Tabasco peppers  - 30,000 SHU 
 Pequin peppers  - 75,000 SHU 
 Scotch bonnet  habanero - 200,000 SHU 
 Red Seville  habanero  - 450,000 SHU 
 Bhut jolokia  - 1,000,000 SHU 
 Pepper Spray - 4,000,000 SHU 
 Generally sauces made from the same peppers will have a comparatively low rating compared to the peppers themselves. Almost all manufacturers will advertise the peppers used and sometimes an included SHU.
 
 El Yucateco Green Habanero Sauce is rated at 9,000 SHU, less than 1/10 the rating of the peppers themselves. 
 Z... Nothing Beyond Hot Sauce is rated at 4,000,000 SHU, which is the same range as most self-defense pepper sprays. 
 T he Ghost, made using Bhut Jolokia, rates in at around 1,000,000 SHU.
