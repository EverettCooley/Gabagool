 Most of the Sierra Leonean soups are consistent and include meat. A specific Sierra Leonean soup is the egusi soup, which contains minced meat, ground egusi, beef bullion cube, stockfish and smoked fish, palm oil, pepper, onion and sorrel leaves. The soup can be eaten with the foo-foo, rice or cassava. There is a complex recipe that defines both a meat meal and a soup: the West African lemony chicken and okra soup, which is prepared with broiler chicken, lime juice, chicken broth, peeled and chopped tomatoes, canned tomatoes paste, browned onion, cayenne pepper, uncooked long grain rice, ground pepper and turmeric and sliced okra (fresh or frozen).
