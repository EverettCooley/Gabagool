Tiny pancakes that are traditionally served directly out of the pan with a little cube of butter melting over them and completely covered in icing sugar. You can get them at a 'poffertjeskraam' (poffertjes stall/ eating house, usually encountered near shopping centers during the fall and winter seasons)
