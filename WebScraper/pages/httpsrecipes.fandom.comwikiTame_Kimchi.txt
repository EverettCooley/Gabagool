 ¼ cup  kosher salt  or  sea salt

 1-3 teaspoon hot  chili sauce  or  chili flakes 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 3 tablespoons  rice vinegar 
 2 tablespoons  canola oil  or  corn oil

 Chill the salad for at least 1 hour before serving. 
 It will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. 
 Variation : 
 This kimchi doesn't undergo a fermenting process, as real kimchi does. If you'd like to ferment this kimchi, omit the  oil , and put the mixture into a large sterilized jar. Let the kimchi stand at room temperature for 2-4 days, opening the jar once a day to let out the gases that build up. Store the kimchi in the refrigerator after this period. It will keep for several weeks.
