 Yugoslavia
 
According to Yugoslavian Tradition This Dish is Made With  Pork  Chops,But it is Just as Flavorful Made With Any Other Tender Cut of Meat.Culbastija is a Modernized Version of Roast on The Spit Which inYugoslavia is The Culinary Highlight of a Picnic or a VintageFestival. The Fireplace is Improvised; Two Fork Branches Are StuckInto The Ground to Hold a Spit That Has a Rotating Device at OneEnd. a Hole, in Which a Charcoal Fire is Ignited, is Dug UnderneathThe Spit. Only When The Fire is Burned Down And Reduced to GlowingCharcoal Can The Roasting Begin. if The Roast Tends to Brown TooRapidly, The Heat is Controlled by Throwing Ashes Onto The GlowingCoals. During The Roasting, The Meat is Brushed Frequently WithShortening or  oil  Until a Firm Crust Has Formed. The Roast MustRemain Juicy And Pink Inside.
 if Necessary, Cook Culbastija Under a Broiler, But For Best ResultsFollow Directions For Grilling Over an Open Fire.
