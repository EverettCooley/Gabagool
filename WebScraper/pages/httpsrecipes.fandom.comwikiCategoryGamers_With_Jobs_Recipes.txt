      Gamers With Jobs Community     
 Gamers With Jobs  is a gaming community for gamers that are into other things as well! Here are some of their favorite recipes!
 Here is a concept you don’t run across every day – gamers are little kids right, not adults with families, responsibilities, pets, cars, homes and, to top it all – JOBS! This intriguing website proves us wrong and redefines the word “gamer” for those of use that only look at it from a shallow perspective. As you would expect, the forums hosted on the website are about games – PC, xbox, Play Station – you name it. However, the members of the forums – this weird but captivating online community – also have other interests. This is why the website is a combination of Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde – one is the adult that handles all those responsibilities, while the other is the crazy little kid that ignores biological age and is always young at heart.
 But there’s more than the forums. The website administrators have an updated schedule for all the upcoming games. Oh, and they do more than that – they also organize online massacres, races or economical clashes. If you are up for an Unreal Tournament challenge, this is the place to be. If you think this is nice… check this out – Gamers with Jobs also has a radio station! This self-proclaimed “mature video gaming podcast for people who hate podcasts.” offers audio information and debates on all the hottest game related topics.
 There are also articles, personal opinions, game reviews. This is a place where any gamer (with a job or without one) will feel right at home. Gamers with Jobs is more than one of the million game related websites out there. GWJ is a place where the kid in adults is roaming free and where the posts and articles have a certain “something” that keeps you reading the next one, and the next one, and the next one… And speaking of gamers and their jobs, we can only think of George Burns’ eternal words: "Too bad the only people who know how to run the country are busy driving cabs and cutting hair."
