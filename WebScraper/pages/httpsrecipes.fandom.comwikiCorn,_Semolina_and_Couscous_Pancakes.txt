Description : 
 I just made this one up because the ingredients were the only stuff I had at home at the time. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 100 g of fine  cornflour 
 1 cup  semolina 
 1 cup  couscous 
 2  eggs 
 Â½ cup  milk   or   water , about 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients and work into a thick dough. 
 Use a spoon to make small (about 10 cm in diameter) pancakes and fry in very hot  oil  until golden. 
 Serve hot as side with a creamy soup (like  cream of tomato ,  peas  etc.). 
 The  couscous  is crunchy while the pancakes are hot. 
 The  baking powder  is optional. The pancakes are lighter with it but somewhat dryer.
