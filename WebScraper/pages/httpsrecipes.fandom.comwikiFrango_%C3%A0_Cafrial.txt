Description : 
 Barbecued chicken. In Mozambique about 4 Tbsp of hot red pepper are used in the Cafrial. In this recipe,  crushed red peppers  may be substituted. 1 tsp  cayenne pepper  will give quite a "bite," so if you prefer to hold the seasoning and add it after the chickens are cooked, cut down on the amount given.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 x 2½ lb whole  chickens 
 Seasoning : 
 1 tsp  cayenne pepper 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 1 tsp  garlic powder 
 ½ tsp  ground ginger 
 1 tsp  paprika 
 ½ cup  salad oil 
 Directions : 
 Combine all seasoning ingredients and blend thoroughly. 
 Rub chickens with the seasoned  oil  on all sides thoroughly. 
 Roast, broil, or barbecue the chickens in your favorite manner, basting them from time to time with the seasoned  oil  until chickens are done. 
 Cut chickens in half. 
 Serve with plenty of  white rice  (allow 1 cup cooked  rice  per person).
