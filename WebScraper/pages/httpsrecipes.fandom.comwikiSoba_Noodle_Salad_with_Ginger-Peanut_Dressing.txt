Description : 
       Soba Noodle Salad with Ginger-Peanut Dressing     
 Soba  are Japanese buckwheat noodles - you can find them at some grocery stores; if not, any Asian food store should have them. (The recipe originally called for  ramen , but I just couldn't do that to people). I've also had good luck finding dried  shiitake mushrooms  at a reasonable price at Asian food stores. Prep time includes the final sitting time.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Dressing : 
 2 tablespoons  ginger , minced 
 ¼ cup  sweet rice wine  ( mirin ) 
 1 tablespoon  turbinado sugar   or   brown sugar 
 ¼ teaspoon  sea salt 
 3 tablespoons  peanut butter 
 ¼ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 2 tablespoons  soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons  rice vinegar 
 1 teaspoon  sesame oil 
 Salad : 
 1 lb  asparagus 
 2 ounces fresh  snow peas 
 1  red bell pepper 
 3 ounces  shiitake mushrooms 
 1 cup  bean sprouts , rinsed 
 8 ounces  soba  noodles 
 ¼ cup roasted  peanuts , chopped 
 Directions : 
 Combine all dressing ingredients in a small pan and whisk over low heat until smooth. 
 Set aside. 
 Trim the  asparagus  and cut into 2-inch pieces. 
 Cut  snow peas  into thirds after pulling the strings. 
 Cook the  asparagus  in boiling  water  for 3 minutes (time it!). 
 Add the  snow peas  and cook another 30 seconds, then drain immediately in a colander and rinse with cold  water  until cool. 
 Pat the vegetables dry and put into a bowl. 
 Cut the  pepper  into ¼ inch slices and slice the  mushrooms  thinly. 
 Toss the  pepper  and  mushrooms  with the  asparagus ,  snow peas , and  bean sprouts  as well as 3 tbs of dressing, then refrigerate. 
 Bring a pot of  water  to a boil, break the  soba  noodles into halves or thirds, and cook until tender. 
 Drain and rinse. 
 Toss the noodles with the vegetable mix and the remaining dressing, then refrigerate for 15 minutes to let the flavors blend and the noodles absorb some of the dressing. 
 Garnish with  peanuts  and serve.
