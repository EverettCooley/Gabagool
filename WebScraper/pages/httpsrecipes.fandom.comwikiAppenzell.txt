 Wikipedia Article  About Appenzell on Wikipedia 
 Appenzeller cheese is a hard cow's-milk cheese produced in the Appenzell region of northeast Switzerland. An herbal brine, sometimes incorporating wine or cider, is applied to the wheels of cheese while they cure, which flavours and preserves the cheese while promoting the formation of a rind.
 Appenzeller has a documented history of at least 700 years. Today, about 75 dairies produce it, each with a different recipe for their brine wash. Most of the recipes are trade secrets.
 The cheese is straw-colored, with tiny holes and a golden rind. It has a strong smell and a nutty or fruity flavour, which can range from mild to tangy, depending on how long it is aged. Three types are sold:
 
 "Classic". Aged three to four months. The wheels are wrapped in a silver label. 
 "Surchoix". Aged four to six months. Gold label. 
 "Extra". Aged six months or longer. Black label. 
 A Whole-milk cow's cheese that has a golden yellow rind and a firm, straw-colored curd with timy holes. The flavor is somewhat fruity owing to the wine or cider wash it receives during curing.
