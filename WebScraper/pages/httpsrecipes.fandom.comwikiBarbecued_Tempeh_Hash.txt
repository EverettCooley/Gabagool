 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 Tbs.  vegetable oil 
 1 medium  Onion , chopped 
 1 medium green  bell pepper , chopped 
 1 medium clove  garlic , minced 
 1 cup low-sodium  vegetable broth , plus additional if needed 
 3 cups peeled, diced all-purpose  potatoes  ( 1/2-inch pieces) 
 8-oz. pkg.  tempeh , cut into 1/2-inch dice 
 1/2 tsp. dried  oregano 
 1/4 tsp.  salt 
 3/4 cup barbecue sauce 
 Directions : 
 In large skillet, heat  oil  over medium heat. Add  Onion  and  bell pepper  and cook, stirring often, until  Onion  is softened, about 7 minutes. Add  garlic  and cook, stirring, 1 minute.
 
 Stir in 1 cup broth,  potatoes ,  tempeh ,  oregano  and  salt . Season with freshly ground  pepper  to taste. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat slightly and cook gently until  potatoes  are barely tender, about 8 minutes. (There should be a little liquid left in the pan; if not, stir in additional broth or  water  by the tablespoon.)
 
 Stir in barbecue sauce and simmer uncovered until liquid is like a thick gravy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, at least 10 minutes. Reheat briefly and serve hot.
