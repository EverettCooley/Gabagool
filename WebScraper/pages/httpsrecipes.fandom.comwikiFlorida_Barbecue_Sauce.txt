 This barbecue sauce is mixed with fruit for extra sweetness and tang, used for meat, poultry, and seafood. Lemon or lime zest and white vinegar work for this but replace the cider vinegar, too.

 1 stick unsalted  butter 
 1 cup  cider vinegar 
 1 cup  ketchup 
 5 to 6 oz. prepared  horseradish 
 juice of lemons, limes, pineapples, oranges, mangoes, guavas, or tamarinds, your choice 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 1 tbsp.  Worcestershire sauce 
 1 tsp. hot sauce or Sriracha 
 Directions : 
 In a medium-size, stainless, or enamelware saucepan, melt butter. Add remaining ingredients. 
 Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, 20 to 25 minutes. 
 Use as a basting sauce on pork, chicken, and beef and serve as a table sauce. Spoon or pour contents from the homemade barbecue sauce into a glass or plastic jar. Left-over sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to 2 or 3 weeks.
