Description : 
 If you receive candied or spiced nuts as a holiday gift, try them on this salad for a special touch. To splurge, use a variety of mushrooms such as shiitake, portobello, oyster or enoki. Often grocers carry a gourmet mushroom mix. Standard white mushrooms will yield tasty results too. 
 Make the vinaigrette up to two days ahead and refrigerate in an airtight container. Let it come to room temperature and whisk before serving.
