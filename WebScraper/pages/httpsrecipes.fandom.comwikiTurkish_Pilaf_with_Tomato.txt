 Description : 
 This is a wonderful, mild pilaf made with  tomato juice  and optional  cinnamon . The handkerchief steaming is what makes it authentically Turkish. Because of the steaming, the cook time is 30 minutes longer than just cooking the  rice .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  long-grain rice  or  basmati rice 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 boiling  water 
 1 tablespoon unsalted  butter 
 2 cups  tomato juice 
 salt 
 1 small  cinnamon  stick, optional 
 Directions : 
 Place the  rice  and  salt  in a small bowl and pour in boiling  water  to cover; set aside until  water  cools; drain, wash with cold  water  and drain again. Bring  butter ,  tomato juice ,  salt  to taste and optional  cinnamon  stick if desired, to boil in a heavy saucepan; add  rice , stir, cover and boil for 2 minutes. Lower heat and simmer  rice  until all the liquid is absorbed; turn off the heat, cover the pan with a clean handkerchief or kitchen towel, replace the cover and set aside for 30 minutes before serving.
