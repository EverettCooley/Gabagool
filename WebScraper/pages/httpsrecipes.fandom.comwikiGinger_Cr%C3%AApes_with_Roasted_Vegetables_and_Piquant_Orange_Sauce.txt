Description : 
 .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup whole- Wheat   pastry flour 
 1 tsp.  Wasabi  powder 
 1 tsp. dried  mustard 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 Pinch of  Cayenne 
 6-inch piece  fresh ginger 
 1 1/2 Tbs.  vegetable oil , plus 1/4 cup for brushing 
 1 1/2 Tbs. toasted  sesame oil , plus additional for brushing 
 Roasted Vegetables 
 Directions : 
 In large bowl, sift together both flours,  Wasabi ,  mustard ,  salt  and  Cayenne . Set aside.
 
 Using fine holes of a box grater or a  ginger  grater, finely grate  ginger  and squeeze to extract juice. Measure out 1/4 cup juice; discard grated  ginger . In medium bowl, combine  ginger juice , 1 1/2 tablespoons  vegetable oil , 1 1/2 tablespoons  sesame oil  and 2 3/4 cups  water .
 
 In food processor fitted with plastic dough blade, combine  flour  mixture and about one-third of the  ginger  mixture. To prevent spattering, use pulse button to blend in remaining  ginger  mixture. Transfer batter to small bowl. Pour remaining 1/4 cup  vegetable oil  into another small bowl.
 
 Place 8-inch nonstick crepe pan or other heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; brush pan with a little  vegetable oil . When pan is hot, pour scant 1/4 cup batter into center of pan and quickly rotate pan to spread batter evenly. (Don’t worry if crepe isn’t perfectly round.) Pour any excess batter back into bowl.
 
 Cook 60 to 70 seconds. With rubber spatula, gently loosen edge of crepe and lift to see if brown spots appear on underside. When they do, flip crepe and cook until light golden brown. Transfer to wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter to make about 20 crepes, whisking batter as needed and brushing pan with more  vegetable oil  between batches.
 
 To assemble: Preheat oven to 350 °F. Lightly brush shallow casserole dish with  sesame oil . Place about 1/3 cup Roasted Vegetables across center of 1 crepe; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon tofu- garlic  mixture (from Roasted Vegetables recipe). Fold bottom of crepe tightly over filling, pressing gently, then fold opposite end over. Crepe should be firmly packed. Place crepe, seam side down, in prepared casserole. (If you prefer bite-size crepes, cut each into fourths.) Repeat with remaining vegetables, crepes and tofu- garlic  mixture.
 
 Lightly brush crepes with  sesame oil . Bake until heated through, 25 to 30 minutes. Drizzle with Piquant  orange  Sauce and serve hot..
