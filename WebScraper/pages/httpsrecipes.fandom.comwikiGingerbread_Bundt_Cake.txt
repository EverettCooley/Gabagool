INGREDIENTS : 
 For the gingerbread Bundt cake 
  Nonstick baking spray 
  3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 
  1 tablespoon  ground ginger 
  2 teaspoons  ground cinnamon 
  2 teaspoons baking soda 
  1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt 
  2 large eggs 
  1 cup mild vegetable oil 
  3/4 cup granulated sugar 
  1 cup unsulfured molasses 
  1 cup hot water 
 For the lemon glaze 
  1 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar 
  1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 
 DIRECTIONS : 
 Prepare the oven
 Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Spray a 10-cup Bundt pan generously with nonstick baking spray.
 Make the gingerbread Bundt cake
 In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs well. Whisk in the oil, then whisk in the granulated sugar followed by the molasses. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Add the hot water and stir well. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.
 Bake the cake until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
 Make the lemon glaze
 Whisk the confectioners’ sugar with the lemon juice until smooth.
 Assemble the cake
 Flip the cake out onto a rack set over a baking sheet. Let the cake cool for another 5 minutes.
 Using a long skewer, poke deep holes all over the cake. Drizzle the glaze over the cake, trying to get some into each hole and brushing the glaze so it covers the entire surface of the cake. Serve warm or let cool completely.
