 4 oz  buckwheat  flakes 
 2½ oz  linseed 
 3 oz  sesame seeds

 After two hours or more, stir the mixture thoroughly. 
 The consistency should now be like thick porridge. 
 Pour away any superfluous liquid. 
 Take a flat baking tray and cover with baking parchment. 
 Spread the mixture thinly and evenly over the parchment. 
 Bake at 310 °F for 30 minutes. 
 Slice into rectangles and bake for a further half hour. 
 If it is not quite dry, turn off the heat and leave the crispbread in the oven. 
 Variations : 
 Add spices such as caraway, and chopped herbs such as  rosemary , coriander,  basil  and stinging  nettles . For a slightly sweeter crispbread, add desiccated  coconut  and  almonds .
