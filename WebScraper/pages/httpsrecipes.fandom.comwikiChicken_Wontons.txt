 Ingredients : 
 1  onion , chopped 
 1  garlic  clove, crushed 
 1 slice  ginger , grated 
 250 grams (8 ounces)  chicken  meat, minced 
 2 tablespoons  peanut butter 
 1 tablespoon  sweet chilli sauce 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 30  wonton wrappers 
 oil  for stir-frying 
 oil  for deep-frying 
 Dipping sauce of your choice 
 Directions : 
 Heat wok and add  oil , drizzling the  oil  down the sides of the wok. 
 Stir-fry the crushed  garlic ,  ginger  and  Onion . 
 Add the  Chicken  meat and stir-fry on high heat until the  Chicken  browns. Add the seasonings, stirring. 
 Remove the wok from the burner and allow the mixture to cool. 
 Set out the  wonton wrappers  with a small bowl filled with  water . 
 Lay out 1 wonton wrapper, and place approximately 1 tablespoon of the  Chicken  mixture in the middle. 
 Dip your finger in the  water  and run it along the edges of the wonton wrapper to wet. 
 Take another wonton wrapper and place it on top in a way that forms a star shape (the top wrapper looks like a diamond instead of a square). 
 Continue with the rest of the mixture. 
 Deep-fry the wontons a few at a time, sliding them carefully into the wok so that the  oil  doesn't splatter. 
 Deep-fry until they turn golden and drain on paper towels. 
 Serve with Sweet and Sour Sauce or the dipping sauce of your choice.
