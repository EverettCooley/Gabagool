Description : 
 This recipe is wonderful. Recently I fixed a Panamanian dinner for close friends here in Colorado with arroz con pollo,  plantain , stuffed  chayote ,  mango  salad and a  coffee  dessert. It was a big hit!
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 lbs  chicken  pieces 
 about a cup of  Crisco 
 1 lb  pork  cut in small pieces 
 1 can  pimentos  (sliced) 
 4  chorizo  sausages 
 ½ bottle stuffed  olives 
 28 oz can  tomatoes 
 2  bay leaves 
 15 oz  tomato sauce 
 4 cups  rice 
 1 bunch  parsley  (chopped) 
 1 tsp  saffron   [1] 
 2 large  onions  (chopped) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 4 cloves  garlic  (chopped) 
 1 can  peas 
 Directions : 
 Brown  chicken  and  pork  in Crisco. 
 Add sausages and cook (I take out some of the grease before adding the rest of the ingredients). 
 Then add  tomatoes ,  tomato  sauce,  parsley ,  onions ,  garlic ,  bay leaves ,  saffron ,  salt  and  pepper . 
 Simmer until  chicken  is tender. 
 Remove  chicken  and add  rice . 
 Cook on medium high until liquid is absorbed. 
 Then cover tightly and steam until  rice  is done. 
 When serving, add can of heated  peas  and pimientos over the top. 
 Arrange  chicken  around the sides (or remove  chicken  from bones and add to  rice ) 
 Parsley  may also be used to decorate. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Saffron  is expensive and sometimes hard to find. I buy packaged  saffron   rice  and substitute half that kind with regular plain  white rice , and it gives it a wonderful flavor.
