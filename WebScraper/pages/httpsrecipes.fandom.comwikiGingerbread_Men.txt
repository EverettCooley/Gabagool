Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  butter 
 ½ cup (scant)  sugar 
 1 cup + 1 tbsp  honey 
 1 tbsp gingerbread spices (ground  cardamom ,  anise ,  cloves ,  cinnamon ,  ginger  - mixed together according to taste) 
 1 small pinch of  salt 
 grated peel of 1 fresh  lemon 
 2 tbsp  sugar 
 1  egg yolk 
 2½ tsp  baking soda 
 2 tbsp  rosewater 
 2¼ cups  flour 
 vanilla or  Chocolate Icing  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Melt together the  butter ,  sugar , and honey over low heat, then allow to cool. 
 Add the gingerbread spices,  salt , grated  lemon peel ,  sugar , and the  egg  yolk; stir until lightened. 
 Stir the  baking soda  into the  rosewater  and add to the  egg  yolk mixture. 
 Combine this mixture with the  flour  and knead into a dough. 
 Let stand overnight. 
 Preheat the oven to 400°F. 
 Generously  butter  a baking sheet. 
 Roll out the dough on the sheet about ¼ inch thick, and cut the dough into long rectangles or stamp out little gingerbread men with a cookie cutter (the original "kathrinchen" are shaped like the pastries called "langues du chat", or "cat's tongues" - or ladyfingers with broadened ends). 
 Whatever design you decide on, bake for 15 to 20 minutes. 
 And, if you choose, frost with vanilla or  Chocolate Icing  when cookies are lukewarm.
