 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 peanut oil  (or any cooking  oil ) 
 one  Chicken  (for the gourmet version, four to six  Chicken  breasts) cut into bite-sized or serving-sized pieces 
 one or two  onions , cut up 
 one or two cloves of  garlic , minced (optional) 
 one cup  tomato  paste (or  tomato  sauce) 
 one cup  Peanut   butter  (natural, or homemade is best) 
 one cup  water 
 cayenne pepper  or red pepper,  black pepper ,  salt 
 Directions : 
 Heat a couple spoonfuls of  oil  in a deep pot. Add the  Chicken  and fry it on both sides until it is browned and nearly done. Remove the  Chicken  and set aside. (It might be best to fry part of the  Chicken  and remove it, and then repeat the process two or three times. 
 Chicken  cooks best if the  Chicken  pieces do not touch each other while frying.) 
 Fry the  onions  and  garlic  in the same pot. Stir in  tomato  paste. Reduce heat and simmer for a few minutes. Return  Chicken  to pot. 
 Stir in  Peanut   butter  (if using  peanuts , first shell and roast them, then grind or mash them into a paste, adding  water  if needed). Be sure to use a very low heat or  Peanut   butter  will scorch. Stir in enough  water  to make  tomato  paste and  Peanut   butter  into a smooth sauce. Add spices to taste. Stir. Simmer on low heat until  Chicken  is done.
