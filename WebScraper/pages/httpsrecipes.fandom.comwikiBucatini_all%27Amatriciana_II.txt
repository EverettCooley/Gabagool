Description : 
 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 320 g [11 oz]  bucatini  (thick hollow  spaghetti ) 
 300 g [10 oz] tinned [canned] diced  tomatoes 
 100 g [3 1 oz]  guanciale  (cured hog jowl and cheek � if unavailable 
 substitute pancetta or unsmoked  Bacon ) 
 50 g [2 oz] grated well-aged  Pecorino  (hard  Cheese  made from ewe�s  milk ) 
 2 tbsp  oil 
 1 pinch of hot  chilli pepper 
 salt 
 freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Cut the guanciale into cubes and brown in  oil  in a pan, on a medium-high flame, for 4–5 minutes. 
 When thoroughly browned, remove from the pan and reserve. 
 Pour the  tomatoes  into the pan � with the  oil  used to brown the meat � season with  salt  and  pepper  and cook for 10–15 minutes. 
 In the meantime, cook the  Pasta  in boiling salted  water . Drain when still rather "al dente", place in a large bowl and mix with the sauce. 
 Finish off with the guanciale, plenty of grated  Cheese  and the  chilli pepper . Mix and serve. 
 For a tastier alternative, you can cook the guanciale with the  tomatoes  and flavour the sauce with 1 glass  white wine . 
 Otherwise, you can fry the guanciale, remove it from the pan, fry a chopped  Onion  in the  oil  and then add the  tomatoes . 
 In fact there are many variations on this recipe, which has become a classic in Italian cuisine. 
 However, it must be said that the real "amatriciana" should not include  tomato , but should only be made with guanciale, browned and seasoned with a piece of  chilli pepper . 
 This recipe gets its name from Amatrice, the town in the province of Rieti where it was created.
