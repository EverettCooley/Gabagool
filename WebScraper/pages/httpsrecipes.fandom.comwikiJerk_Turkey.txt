Description : 
 This the main entree for a single person's feast or a couple's budget banquet, but you can cut up a whole  turkey  and prepare it as described in this recipe.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  turkey  thigh, fresh or thawed if frozen, skin and fat removed 
 3 cups  white vinegar 
 2 cups  brown sugar 
 ¼ cup fresh  ginger  root, peeled and finely grated 
 1 large  red onion , peeled and chopped 
 2 tablespoons dried  allspice  berries 
 ½ cup (more or less) Pickapeppa sauce, or any of a number of other Caribbean-style pepper sauces that are commercially available ( Tabasco  makes a good one, and Busha Browne's Jerk Sauce also works well) 
 Directions : 
 Stab the  turkey  thigh repeatedly with a meat fork to make it easier for the marinade to thoroughly penetrate the meat. 
 Mix the  vinegar  and  sugar  in a 2 quart or more glass casserole dish (one that has a cover). 
 Stir until the  sugar 's dissolved. 
 Stir in the  ginger ,  onion  and  allspice . 
 Put the  turkey  in the dish, turning it a few times in the marinade and spooning a few of the  ginger  strands,  allspice   berries  and  onions  onto the top of the meat. 
 Cover the dish and put in in the refrigerator. 
 Let marinate for a day, turning the meat and stirring the marinade ingredients several times. 
 Prepare the barbecue fire of your choice. 
 Cook the  turkey  on the barbecue, brushing on the Pickapeppa sauce as you turn it. 
 The  turkey  will be done when all juices coming from it turn clear.
