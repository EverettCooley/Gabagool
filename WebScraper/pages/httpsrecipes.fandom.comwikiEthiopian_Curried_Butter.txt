 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 3" piece  ginger  peeled and grated 
 1/2  Onion , minced 
 1  garlic  clove peeled and minced 
 2Â lb  butter 
 1 2" piece  cinnamon 
 1 tbl  fenugreek seeds 
 2 tsp  cumin  seeds 
 1 tbl  basil , minced 
 1 tsp  cardamon  seeds 
 1 tbl Fresh  oregano 
 1/2 tsp  turmeric 
 1/4 tsp Ground  nutmeg 
 2 Cloves 
 Directions : 
 Combine  ginger ,  Onion , and  garlic , and pound to a coarse paste with a mortar and pestle. Set aside. 
 Melt the  butter  over low heat, stirring constantly, taking care that it does not darken. Skim off the foam as it rises and continue cooking until all the foam is gone. 
 Add the paste and all remaining ingredients to the  butter  and simmer, uncovered, at the lowest possible heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. 
 Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Pour off the transparent top layer and reserve it, leaving behind as much of the  milk  solids and spices as possible. Strain the transparent layer through several layers of cheesecloth. The  butter  will usually be an  oil  at room temperature and will solidify in the refrigerator, where it can be kept, covered, for 3 or 4 months.
