Description : 
       Cherry Dump Cake     
 This recipe, which is great served warm with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, comes from my paternal grandmother, who I liked to call Nanae. As a side note, you can substitute  peaches ,  strawberries , etc. If you want the cake to be a little dryer, cover with foil and cook a little longer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  cherry  pie filling 
 1 box Duncan Hines golden butter cake mix 
 2 sticks melted  butter 
 1 x 15-oz can crushed  pineapple  (use the  juice  too) 
 1 cup  coconut 
 1 Â½ cups  pecans 
 Directions : 
 Spread pie filling on bottom of pan. Spread  pineapple  on top of  cherries , and add  coconut  next. Add dry cake mix. Cover with pats of  butter  and  pecans  on top. Bake at 350 degrees 1 hour.
