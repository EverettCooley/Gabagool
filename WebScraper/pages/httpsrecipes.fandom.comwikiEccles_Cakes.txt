 Prep Time: 45min 
 Cook time: 15-20 min 
 Serves: 8 
 
 Description : 
 Baked originally at Eccks in Lancashire, but now available countrywide, these cakes are pastries with a sweet spicy mixture enclosed in a puff pastry case. They should have a shiny coating and are best eaten warm.
 Each crisp round, glazed with egg white and sugar, is crammed with fruity filling.
 
 Ingredients : 
 25 g (1 oz)  butter 
 100 g (4 oz)  currants 
 25 g (1 oz) chopped mixed  peel 
 50 g (2 oz)  demerara sugar 
 2.5 ml (½ tsp) ground  mixed spice 
 212 g (7½ oz) packet frozen  puff pastry , thawed 
 1  egg white 
 caster sugar  for sprinkling 
 Directions : 
 Melt the butter in a saucepan, then stir in the currants, peel, sugar and spice and mix thoroughly together. 
 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry very thinly and cut out eight 12.5 cm (5 inch) circles using a saucer as a guide. 
 Divide the fruit mixture between the circles, damp the edges of the pastry and draw them to the centre, sealing well together. 
 Turn the cakes over and roll gently into circles with a rolling pin. 
 Brush with egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. 
 Make 3 diagonal cuts across the top of each. 
 Place on dampened baking sheets and bake at 220°C (425°F) mark 7 for about 15 minutes, until light golden brown. 
 Eccles cakes are best eaten while still slightly warm.
