In Mexican cuisine,  Pico de gallo  (Spanish for "rooster's beak") is a fresh, uncooked  condiment  made from chopped tomatoes, onions, and sometimes chiles (typically  jalapeños  or  serranos ). Other ingredients may also be added, such as  lemon  or  lime juice , fresh  cilantro  (leaf of coriander),  cucumber ,  radish  or other fresh firm pulpy fruit such as  mango .
 Pico de gallo can be used in much the same way as Mexican  salsas  or Indian  chutneys , but since it contains less liquid, it can also be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as tacos and fajitas.
 In some regions of Mexico, a fruit salad (watermelon, orange, jícama, cucumber and sometimes melon and papaya) tossed in lime juice and hot sauce or chamoy and sprinkled with a salty Chile powder is also known as pico de gallo; it is a popular snack and it's usually sold outside schools, while the tomato-based condiment is better known as salsa picada, which means minced or chopped sauce, salsa bandera or salsa mexicana, because the colors red (tomato), white (onion), and green (chile) are the colors of the Mexican flag.
