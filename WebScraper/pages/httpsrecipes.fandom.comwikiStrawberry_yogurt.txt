 About Yogurt : 
 Yoghurt or yogurt, less commonly yoghourt or yogourt, is a dairy product produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. Any sort of milk may be used to make yoghurt, but modern production is dominated by cow's milk. It is the fermentation of milk sugar (lactose) into lactic acid that gives yoghurt its gel-like texture and characteristic tang.
 
 Flavored yogurt : 
 To offset its natural sourness, yogurt can be sold sweetened, flavored, mixed with fruit, or in containers with fruit or fruit jam on the bottom.  Yogurt sold commercially may have added pectin, found naturally in fruit, and/or gelatin to artificially create thickness and creaminess at lower cost. Some yoghurts, often called "cream line," are made with whole milk which has not been homogenized so the cream rises to the top. 
 In the USA, sweetened, flavored yoghurt is the most popular type, typically sold in single-serving plastic cups. Typical flavors are vanilla, honey, or fruit such as strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, or peach.
