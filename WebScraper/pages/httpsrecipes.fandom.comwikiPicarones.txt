       Picarones     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  dark brown sugar 
 1 cup  granulated sugar 
 2  cinnamon  sticks (4") 
 4 - 6  cloves 
 1 cup  milk 
 1 tbsp active dry  yeast 
 2 tsp  cornstarch 
 1 cup puréed  butternut squash  (or replace with  sweet potatoes ) 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 ⅛ tsp  coarse salt 
 6 cups  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 The syrup : 
 In a small saucepan, combine the  dark brown sugar , 1 cup  granulated sugar ,  cinnamon ,  chili pepper , and cloves with 1 cup  water . 
 Simmer over a low flame for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens into a syrup. 
 Set aside to cool. 
 In a small mixing bowl, combine the  milk  and  yeast  with 1 tablespoon of  sugar  and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until creamy. 
 Stir in the  cornstarch  and allow to sit a few minutes longer. 
 Place the puréed  squash  or  sweet potatoes  in a large bowl. 
 Add the yeast- cornstarch  mixture and blend thoroughly. 
 The dough : 
 Stir in the  flour  and  salt  and continue to stir vigorously to make a runny, soft, well-blended dough. 
 Place the mixing bowl in a draft-free place, cover with a dampened cloth of plastic wrap, and let rise for about 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. 
 Deflate the dough with a wooden spoon. 
 The dough should be soft. 
 In a deep fryer or heavy saucepan, heat the  oil  to 325 °F. 
 Dip out 1 tbs of the dough and, with another tablespoon, scrape the dough into the hot  oil  and fry until golden. 
 As soon as they are cooked, remove the picarones from the  oil  with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 
 To serve, arrange the picarones on a platter and pour the syrup over them.
