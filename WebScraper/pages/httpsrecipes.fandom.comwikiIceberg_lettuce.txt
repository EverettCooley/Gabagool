 About Iceberg lettuce : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Iceberg Lettuce on Wikipedia 
 Crisphead, also called Iceberg: lettuces form tight, dense heads that resemble cabbage. They are generally the mildest of the lettuces, valued more for their crunchy texture than for flavor. Varieties of iceberg lettuce are the most familiar lettuces in the USA. The name Iceberg comes from the way the lettuce was transported in the US in the 1930s. It was transported on trainwagons all covered in crushed ice - making it look like icebergs.
