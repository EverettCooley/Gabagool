 About Sunflower oil : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Sunflower oil on Wikipedia 
 Also known as sunflower seed oil, this golden colored oil is derived from the seeds of the sunflower plant. Refined sunflower oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and low in saturated fats. It has a fairly high smoke point so it is an excellent choice for cooking. Other uses for refined sunflower oil are for the commercial production of confectionery foods and margarine and shortening production. Unrefined sunflower oil has better flavor than the refined version and a greater level of heart-healthy oleic acid, but it has a lower smoke point so it is not as useful for cooking. It is best used as a base for salad dressings.
