Description : 
 .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ cups  non-fat milk  (divided) 
 ¾ cup  crystallized ginger 
 3 tablespoons  sugar 
 ½ teaspoon fresh (compressed)  yeast 
 1¼ cups Sir Galahad  all-purpose flour 
 ¾ cup  buckwheat flour 
 150 g (5.3 ounces)  rolled oats 
 1 tablespoon  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon  baking powder 
 2  egg whites  (Heidi note: I ended up using 4) 
 ⅓ cup melted  butter 
 Directions : 
 The night before, gently warm ½ cup of the  milk  and dissolve the  yeast . Don't heat the  milk  too much or it will kill the  yeast . 
 Chop the  ginger  and steep it in a different ½ cup of hot  milk , let it steep for ten minutes, so the  milk  becomes flavored. 
 Combine the remaining ½ cup  milk  with the steeped  ginger   milk  and the  yeast   milk . 
 In a separate large bowl combine all the dry ingredients. 
 Pour in the  milk  liquids and stir until combined. 
 Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover with plastic, and leave to rise on a counter overnight. 
 The next morning, heat up your waffle iron. Melt the  butter  in a small saucepan. 
 Whip the  egg whites  in a mixer . Using a mixer with paddle attachment (or by hand) stir in ¾ of the  butter . Mix until fully incorporated. 
 Add the  egg whites , and finish by stirring in the rest of the melted  butter . 
 Ladle waffle batter onto heated waffle maker, and cook until deep and golden brown.
