Description : 
 This variation of taco salad was shown to me many years ago by my old friend's girlfriend. We used to eat it a lot at our parties, since it feeds up to 6 people. For fewer servings, just cut down on the amount of each ingredient.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  ground beef  or  turkey 
 1 package of  taco seasoning 
 1 can of  kidney beans 
 1 small can of  tomato sauce 
 1 head of  lettuce 
 1 bag of shredded  cheese 
 1 bag of Doritos chips 
 1 bottle of Catalina  salad dressing 
 Directions : 
 Cook and drain the ground beef or turkey and return to skillet 
 Add taco seasoning to the ground beef or turkey and stir 
 Add kidney beans and tomato sauce to the seasoned ground beef or turkey and stir 
 Remove the core from the head of lettuce 
 Tear lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place in a very large bowl 
 Break Doritos into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl of lettuce 
 Pour the bag of shredded cheese into the bowl and mix the contents briefly 
 Pour the contents of the skillet into the bowl and stir 
 Finally, pour the Catalina salad dressing into the bowl and stir 
 Serve on plates or in salad bowls
