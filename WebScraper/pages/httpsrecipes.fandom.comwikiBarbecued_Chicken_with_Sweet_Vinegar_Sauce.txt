 Description : 
 This is the first Thai-style dish I ever attempted to make, after I 'discovered' how delicious Thai food is. This recipe is easy enough (for the beginner that I was 10 years ago) and the ingredients not too difficult to find. Prep time does not include the several hours to overnight marinading time.
