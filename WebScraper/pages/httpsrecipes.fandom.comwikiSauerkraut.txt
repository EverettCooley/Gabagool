Sauerkraut  (pronounced /ˈsaʊrkraʊt/ in English; German pronunciation: [ˈzaʊ.ɐkʁaʊt] ( listen), Yiddish: [ˈzɔi̯.əʀ.kʀɔi̯t]) is finely shredded cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria, including Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus. It has a long shelf-life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid that forms when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage. It is therefore not to be confused with coleslaw, which receives its acidic taste from vinegar.
