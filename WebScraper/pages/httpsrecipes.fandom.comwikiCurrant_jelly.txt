 Wikipedia Article  About Currant jelly on Wikipedia 
 Blackcurrants have a slightly bitter taste. They are made into jelly, jam, juice, ice cream, cordial and liqueur. In the UK, Europe and Commonwealth countries, some types of confectionery include a blackcurrant flavour, but this is generally missing in the United States, even within the same brand.
