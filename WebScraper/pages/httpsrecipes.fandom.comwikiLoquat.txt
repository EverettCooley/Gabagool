 About Loquat : 
 The loquat is also called "May apple", "Japanese medlar" and "Japanese plum". This slightly pear-shaped fruit resembles an apricot in size and color. The juicy, crisp flesh is pale yellow and has a delicate, sweetly tart cherry-like flavor. It surrounds 1 to 3 rather large seeds. Loquats bruise easily so they're not good travelers. Loquats can be eaten as a snack, added to salads or used in chicken or duck dishes.
