 In a small bowl, combine  nuts , chips,  sugar  and  cinnamon . 
 Pour  flour  mixture into greased and floured tube pan. 
 You may alternate  flour  mixture then nut and chip mixture. 
 Or you may combine  nuts  and chip mixture to  flour  mixture and pour all into pan. I do the latter.

 Leave cake in pan about 10 minutes then empty on to rack to cool.
