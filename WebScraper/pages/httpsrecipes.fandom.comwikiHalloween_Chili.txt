 Ingredients : 
 1¼ pounds ground goblin gizzards ( ground beef  15% fat) 
 1 medium eye of cyclops ( onion ) 
 1 x 15 oz can soft shelled beetles ( kidney beans ) 
 1 x 28 oz can blood of bat ( V-8 juice ) 
 ⅛ teaspoon puréed wasp ( prepared mustard ) 
 ¼ teaspoon common dried weed ( oregano ) 
 1 dash red-tailed hawk toenails ( crushed red pepper ) 
 2 teaspoons ground sumac blossom ( chili powder ) 
 1 teaspoon hemlock ( honey  or  sugar ) 
 ½ cup fresh grubs (sliced  celery ) 
 1 tablespoon eye of newt ( pearled barley ) 
 1 tablespoon dried maggots (uncooked  rice ) 
 water from a stagnant pond (tap  water ) 
 Directions : 
 Brown the gizzards in an iron cauldron over a fire made from the siding off of a haunted house, add chopped eye of cyclops and simmer until the pieces of eye become translucent again, add blood of bat, and soft shelled beetles, bring to a slow bubbling boil. 
 At this time, add the common weed, maggots, toenails, sumac, grubs, hemlock, eye of newt and the pureed wasp. 
 As it cooks you may want to adjust the consistency with pond water. 
 You can tell it is done when the eye of newt swells and the vertical tan colored 'cats eye' appears on one side.
