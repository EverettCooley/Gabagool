 Ingredients : 
 Authentic Swiss Fondue 
 
 1 large garlic clove, cut in half  
 2 teaspoons cornstarch  
 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 
 3 tablespoons kirsch or brandy  
 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  
 7 ounces (200 g) shredded Gruyere cheese  
 7 ounces (200 g) shredded Emmental cheese 
 Freshly ground black pepper  
 Directions : 
 Rub the cut side of the garlic clove inside a fondue pot and discard. Add the wine and lemon juice to the pot and bring it to a boil on the stove over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low. Toss the Gruyere and Emmental cheeses in a bowl with the cornstarch. One handful at a time, stir the cheeses into the wine, mixing until the cheeses melt before adding more.  
 Cook, stirring constantly, until the fondue just comes to a simmer. Stir in the kirsch, and season with pepper.  
 If the fondue is too thin, add more cheese or stir in cornstarch dissolved in wine. If too thick, stir in a little warmed white wine.  
 To serve, transfer the pot to its stand on the table. Spear the bread cubes onto fondue forks and dunk into the cheese.
