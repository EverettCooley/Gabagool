 Description : 
 Persian herbed meatball soup
 
 Ingredients : 
 Herbed ball : 
 1 lb ground  beef   or   veal 
 1½ cups  rice , raw, well rinsed 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon  turmeric , ground 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper 
 2 tablespoons  tarragon , dried 
 2 bunches  Italian parsley , chopped fine in a processor 
 1 cup  leeks , fine chopped 
 ½ cup  dill , fresh 
 ½ cup  onions , chopped fine 
 Broth : 
 3 tablespoons  oil 
 2 medium  onions , sliced 
 ¼ teaspoon  turmeric , ground 
 1 cup  tomatoes , chopped 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 5 cups  water 
 1 cup  green peas  (fresh  or  frozen) 
 Directions : 
 Mix all the meatball ingredients together and roll into balls, 2½ inches in diameter, firmly packed. 
 Refrigerate them for 1 hour. 
 To make the broth, heat the  oil  in a pan or soup kettle, add the  onions  and  turmeric , and stir-fry over moderate heat until light brown, about 3 minutes. 
 Add the  tomatoes  and  salt  and stir-fry for 2 minutes more. 
 Add the  water  and bring to a boil. 
 Moisten your hands with cold  water . 
 Take each herbed ball and roll it firmly; add the balls to the broth very carefully, one at a time, so that they do not not fall apart. 
 The  water  should just cover the balls. 
 Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat, without stirring, for 45 minutes. 
 Add the  green peas  and cook for 10 minutes more. 
 The broth will reduce somewhat, the balls swell considerably due to the expansion of the  rice . 
 Serve warm—with the meatballs in the broth.
