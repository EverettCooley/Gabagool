 Ingredients : 
 2  onions , chopped 
 6  garlic  cloves, chopped 
 6 Tbsp  olive oil 
 1 lb  beef   sausage , chunked 
 10 cups  beef stock 
 16 oz  kidney beans , with liquid 
 1  cabbage , cored & chopped 
 12  potatoes , new, quartered 
 ¼ cup  balsamic vinegar 
 16 oz  catsup 
 salt  to taste 
 pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Pour  oil  into LARGE, HUMONGOUS, GIGANTIC stock or stew pot and sauté  onions  and  garlic  in it, just until soft and transparent. 
 Add  sausage  chunks and brown slightly. Add  beef stock  and all other ingredients. 
 Bring to a boil, stirring often to keep the bottom of the pan from burning. 
 Reduce heat, simmer 35–45 minutes or longer, stirring occasionally. Correct seasonings to taste. 
 Notes : 
 The recipe SAYS that it yields one gallon, but it's really much more. The hardest part of this recipe is the chopping. You should cut up everything ahead of time ( potatoes ,  sausage ,  cabbage ,  onions ,  garlic ), so you can just dump it all into the pot when you're ready.
