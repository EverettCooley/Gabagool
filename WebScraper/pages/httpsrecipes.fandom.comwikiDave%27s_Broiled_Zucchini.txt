 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 x medium sized  zucchini (s) 
 (about ½ per person as a 
 side dish) 
 x  garlic 
 x  basil 
 x  oregano 
 x  salt 
 x  pepper 
 x grated  Parmesan cheese , or 
 ff  mozzarella  if you prefer 
 Directions : 
 Wash the zukes and slice into planks about 1/8" to ¼" thick. I prefer not to peel them, but do sometimes if the skin is bruised or unattractive. If the zukes are large (long), cut the planks in half. Arrange the planks on a baking sheet. Crush the  garlic  (i cheat and use chopped  garlic  from a jar) and spread it on the  zucchini . When in doubt, use more :) sprinkle on a little  basil  and  oregano ,  salt  and  pepper  to taste. Sprinkle on a little grated  Parmesan cheese . Cook under the broiler 5 – 8 minutes until the zukes are tender, and the  Cheese  is brown. Serve hot, and don"t count on leftovers!
