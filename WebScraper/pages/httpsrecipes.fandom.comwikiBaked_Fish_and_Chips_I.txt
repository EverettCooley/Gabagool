Ingredients : 
 Chips : 
 3 medium  russet potatoes  (1¼ pound) 
 ¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 pinch of  cayenne  pepper 
 Fish : 
 olive oil  cooking spray 
 2¾ cups  crispy rice cereal 
 kosher salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 3 large  egg whites 
 1½ pounds skinless, boneless firm  white fish 
 Directions : 
 Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 450 using the convection setting, if available. 
 Place a baking sheet on one of the racks to preheat. 
 Chips : 
 Prepare the chips: cut the potatoes into ¼" thick sticks. 
 Toss with the olive oil and cayenne in a bowl. 
 Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven, add the potatoes and spread in an even layer. 
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape any oil from the bowl over the potatoes. 
 Bake on the top oven rack, turning once, until browned and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. 
 Season with salt. 
 Fish : 
 Meanwhile, make the fish: set a wire rack on a baking sheet and coat with cooking spray. 
 Lightly crush the cereal in a bowl with your fingers. 
 Add 2 teaspoons salt, and black pepper to taste. 
 In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt until frothy. 
 Dip the fish in the egg whites, then roll in the cereal crumbs to coat. 
 Place the fish pieces on the rack (position them on their sides so that the majority of the crust is exposed) and mist with cooking spray. 
 Bake the fish on the bottom rack until crisp and just cooked through, about 12 minutes. 
 Season with salt and pepper.
