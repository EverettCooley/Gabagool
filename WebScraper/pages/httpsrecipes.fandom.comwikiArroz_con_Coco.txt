 Ingredients : 
 2  coconuts , meat removed 
 3 to 4 cups  rice  (raw) 
 1 tbsp  sugar 
 salt 
 water  (2 cups for every cup of  rice ) 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  coconut  into small pieces. 
 In a blender, grind the  coconut  using boiling  water . 
 Do small amounts at a time. 
 To get a stronger  coconut  flavor, reuse the  coconut milk  from the previous blending. 
 Be sure to strain out the ground  coconut  meat. 
 In a large heavy saucepan, bring the  coconut milk  to boiling. 
 Allow it to boil for 3 or 4 minutes. 
 This helps form the  coconut oil . 
 Add the  rice ,  sugar  and  salt  (as desired). 
 Allow to continue boiling until the  rice  begins to rise in the  water . 
 Be careful not to have the temperature too high as this  rice  burns and sticks easily. 
 As it begins to dry, cover tightly, reduce heat to low and allow the  rice  to finish cooking.
