Description : 
 Delicious marinade given to me years ago by a Korean woman. Excellent for any kind of meat —  beef , roast,  chicken ,  pork , ribs, and  shrimp . Prep time does not include slicing meat, and cook time depends on what you are cooking and by what method, and does not include marinading time. The longer the marinading time, the better!. Enjoy! 
 
 For up to 5 pounds of meat 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  soy sauce 
 1 cup  water 
 ½ cup  honey 
 ½ cup chopped  green onions 
 1 tablespoon  sesame oil  (or any other  oil ) 
 1 teaspoon  black pepper 
 ½ tablespoon Accent seasoning or  msg  (optional, but better with) 
 1 teaspoon  garlic powder  (or less to taste) 
 Directions : 
 If using roast, slice paper-thin. 
 Pour marinade over meat. 
 If using any kind of  beef , let soak overnight room temperature. 
 (the  salt  content from the soy sauce keeps  beef  from going bad). 
 If using any kind of  chicken ,  pork , ribs, or  shrimp ,refrigerate for up to 24 hours in fridge, then cook. 
 Can cook on grill, bake, broil, quick panfry.
