Description 
       Latkes     
 Latkes  are potato pancakes, commonly associated with the Jewish cultural tradition in the United States and Europe. They can be and are served any time, but traditionally form part of the menu during the celebration of Chanukah. Eating potato pancakes is not one of the mitzvot of Chanukah; that is, it is not a fundamental part of the Chanukah rituals, and has no religious significance. It is seen as appropriate to eat foods cooked in oil during a festival that celebrates the miracle of the Chanukah oil. In Israel, potato pancakes are familiar and well-liked, but the  sufganiya  (jelly doughnut) is considered to be more Israeli.
 Various recipes for potato pancakes vary in the degree of fineness to which the potatoes are grated. Some are grated to long strips, others to a fine powder. Both  latkes  and potato pancakes bear a distant resemblance to the American dish,  hash browns ; however, hash browns are merely coarsely grated potatoes with no binding ingredients or flour.
