 Directions : 
 Steak : 
 Combine first 8 ingredients in a shallow container. 
 Remove about ¼ cup marinade and reserve; add  steak  to container, turning to coat meat on both sides and marinate at least 1 hour. 
 To prepare arepas, process  cornmeal  in a blender until finely ground (arepa  flour  doesn’t need further grinding). 
 Transfer to large bowl and stir in  cheese , 2 tablespoons melted  butter  and  salt . 
 Add enough boiling  water  to make a very thick batter; stir in  corn . 
 Brush griddle with remaining 1 tablespoon melted  butter  and heat until medium-hot. 
 Using about 1 tablespoon batter for each arepa, drop batter onto hot griddle and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. 
 Keep warm. 
 Drain  steak  from marinade and place on medium-hot grill or in grill pan. 
 Cook 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. 
 Brush  avocado  slices and  bell pepper  halves with reserved marinade and grill, turning once, until lightly browned with grill marks. 
 Avocado cream : 
 Cut  avocado  into chunks and blend with  sour cream ,  lime juice  and  cayenne  in blender until smooth. 
 Slice  steak  and place a few pieces on each arepa. 
 Cut  bell pepper  into strips and arrange over  steak ; top with grilled  avocado  slices and a dollop of  avocado   cream . 
 Sprinkle with chopped red chilies; garnish with  lime  wedges and  corn  husks filled with chopped chilies.
