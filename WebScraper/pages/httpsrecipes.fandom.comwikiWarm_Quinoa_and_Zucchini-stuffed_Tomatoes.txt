 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  quinoa 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1½ cups purified  water   or   vegetable stock 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 teaspoon  Italian seasoning 
 ½ medium  onion , chopped 
 1 cup grated  zucchini 
 2 tablespoons  currants   or   raisins 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh  parsley   or   basil 
 ½ teaspoon ground  curry  ( or   cumin ) 
 ¼ teaspoon  paprika 
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed  lemon juice 
 6 medium  tomatoes 
 2 teaspoons  breadcrumbs 
 2 tablespoons freshly grated  Parmesan cheese 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 In a small saucepan, toss the  quinoa  in, add one tablespoon  olive oil , stir, pour in the  water ,  salt ,  black pepper  and  Italian seasoning , and bring to a boil. 
 Cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. 
 Pour one tablespoon  olive oil  into a nonstick pan and sauté the chopped  onions ,  zucchini ,  currants ,  parsley  or  basil ,  curry ,  paprika  and  lemon juice  over medium heat for about 2 minutes. 
 Scoop the  quinoa  into the sauté pan and mix thoroughly with a spoon until it is blended with the vegetables to make an aromatic stuffing. Remove from heat. 
 Create a lid for each  tomato  by cutting a star shape around the stem about ¼-inch deep. Remove the top and set it aside. 
 Scoop out the seeds of each  tomato  and some of the loose pulp, being careful to leave a strong wall of  tomato  all around. 
 Spoon equal amounts of the stuffing into the cavities of each  tomato , filling them up generously. 
 Put the  tomatoes  in a small ceramic or glass baking dish and garnish with a sprinkle of bread crumbs and one teaspoon  Parmesan cheese  per  tomato . 
 Cover the baking dish with a glass lid or foil and bake for 25 minutes.  Tomatoes  should be firm and easy to transfer from the baking dish to the serving plates. 
 Garnish by putting the star-shaped  tomato  lids back on top of each  tomato .
