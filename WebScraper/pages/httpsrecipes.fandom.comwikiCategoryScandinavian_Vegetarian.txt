 Although there is no traditional culture for vegetarian cooking in the Scandinavian countries, the last decade has seen an increase in vegetarian dishes. Scandinavian vegetarian dishes are either imported from other countries or they are transformed, by local chefs, from non-vegetarian dishes. Here are some relatively popular Scandinavian vegetarian dishes:
 
 Scandinavian Summer Soup - A vegetable soup, made with potatoes, onions, baby carrots, green beans, and green peas. 
 Boiled Potatoes â€“ boiled potatoes with dill butter. 
 Palt - poached potato dumplings that may also come with pork meat for the non-vegetarian version of this dish.
