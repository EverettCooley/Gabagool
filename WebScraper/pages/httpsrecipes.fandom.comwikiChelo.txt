A pat of  butter  is placed on top, a raw  egg yolk  is dropped in, and the top is sprinkled with  salt , a grindings of  pepper  and if desired a little dried sumak. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups Iranian  rice 
 salt 
 4 teaspoons  butter , melted 
 4 raw  egg yolks 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 dried  sumak  (optional) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 If you are using Iranian  rice , start at least 6 hours ahead. 
 Spread it on a clean surface and pick out and discard any dark or discolored  grains . 
 Then wash it in a fine sieve or colander set under warm running  water  until the draining  water  runs clear. 
 Finally place the  rice  in a large bowl or pot, add Â¼ cup of  salt  and enough cold  water  to cover it by about 1 inch and soak overnight, or for at least 6 hours. 
 If you are using other  long-grain rice , wash it in the same way, but soak it in the  salt   water  for about 2 hours. 
 In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan equipped with a tightly fitting lid, bring 6 cups of fresh  water  to a boil over high heat. 
 Drain the  rice  thoroughly and pour it into the boiling  water . 
 In a slow, thin stream so the  water  does not stop boiling. 
 Stir once or twice, then boil briskly, uncovered for 5 minutes. 
 Drain in a sieve. 
 Pour 1 cup fresh  water  and the melted  butter  in the saucepan and pour in the  parboiled rice , mounding it slightly in the middle of the pan. 
 Cover the pan tightly with a strip of aluminum foil and set the lid in place. 
 Simmer the  rice  over moderate heat to 15 to 20 minutes, or until the  grains  are tender and have absorbed all the liquid in the pan. 
 Serve at once.
