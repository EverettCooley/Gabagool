      Paratha     
 This flaky East Indian bread is made with  whole wheat flour  and fried on a  griddle . Parathas range from the simple to the exotic. The basic version simply has  Ghee  (clarified butter) brushed between multiple layers of  dough  that are then folded and rolled out again. This technique creates a flaky bread resembling puff pastry. More exotic versions of paratha are stuffed with various vegetables, fruits, herbs or spices.
