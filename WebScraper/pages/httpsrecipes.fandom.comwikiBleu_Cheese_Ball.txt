Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 16 oz  cream cheese 
 4 oz crumbled bleu  Cheese 
 2 tbsp chopped  chives  (fresh) 
 Directions : 
 Finely chop the  walnuts  and set aside. 
 I toast them, but they are fine without toasting. 
 Thoroughly mix all other ingredients until completely blended. 
 Cover and refrigerate until firm (about an hour), then form into a ball and roll in the chopped  walnuts . 
 Then, refrigerate until about an hour prior to serving. 
 Allow to come to room temperature, then serve with your favorite crackers and breads. 
 
 
 NOTE 
 
 This particular  Cheese  ball has rich flavors which only improve with time. 
 I usually make it a few days before I am going to serve it so the flavors have time to get acquainted. 
 It is also wonderful with the addition of crumbled  Bacon .
