 There are many meat stews, made with various kinds of meat; a traditional meat stew includes onions, eggplant, tomato paste and fresh tomatoes and it is served with root veggies, cassava or rice. The chicken stew also includes black pepper, lime juice, garlic powder and poultry seasonings. There is a complex recipe that defines both a meat meal and a soup: the West African lemony chicken and okra soup, which is prepared with broiler chicken, lime juice, chicken broth, peeled and chopped tomatoes, canned tomatoes paste, browned onion, cayenne pepper, uncooked long grain rice, ground pepper, turmeric and sliced okra (fresh or frozen).
