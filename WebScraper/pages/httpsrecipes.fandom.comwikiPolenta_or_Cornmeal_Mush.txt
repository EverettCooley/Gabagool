 Ingredients : 
 4 cup  water 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1½ cup  polenta  (coarse  cornmeal ) 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  water  to a boil, and add the  salt . 
 Whisk in the polenta, pouring it in a slow, steady stream so that lumps don't form. 
 Lower the heat, and cook about 30 minutes while stirring. 
 Alternatively, cook the polenta in a  double boiler  over simmering  water  for 45 minutes, stirring it every 15 minutes or so. 
 If you wish to serve soft polenta, keep it over the heat in a  double boiler  until needed. 
 To make firm polenta, pour it into a pan and set aside; after a while, it will cool and firm up. 
 Turn it out of its pan and cut into ½-inch slices. 
 To broil or grill the polenta, brush both sides of each slice with  olive oil , and cook until lightly browned. 
 The slices can also be fried in  butter  or  olive oil , until lightly browned or until crisp. 
 Slices can be used as layers in a casserole.
