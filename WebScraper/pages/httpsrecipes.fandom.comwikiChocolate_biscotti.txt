 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  flour 
 1/2 cup  Sugar  (or more) 
 1/2 cup  cocoa 
 2 tbsp flavoring (i used  raspberry 
 orange  or  almond  would work 
 nicely too) 
 2  egg  equivalents 
 3/4 tbsp  baking powder 
 1/4 tbsp  salt 
 splash of  Liquor  to match 
 flavoring (i used chambord) 
 Directions : 
 Combine  flour ,  Sugar ,  cocoa ,  salt  and baking  baking powder . Separately, mix flavoring and  eggs . Combine. Add splash of  Liquor  or  water  as needed to have a sticky consi stency. If the mixture is too stiff, it won"t spread out properly. Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log about 15 inch es long and 1 ½ - 2" wide. Bake at 350 °F for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, then slice diagonally into ½- ¾" slices. I got 18 pieces from mine. Place the slices on their side and put back in the oven (300 degrees) for 15 minutes. Turn over and cook another 10-15 minutes. If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of  semisweet chocolate  is wonderful on these when cooled. I used about 2 t. for all the cookies, which added about 6 g. Fat to the recipe or 1/3 g. Fat each one
