 About Cranberry sauce : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Cranberry sauce on Wikipedia 
 Cranberry sauce is a sauce or relish made out of Cranberries.
 The Cranberries are boiled with sugar and often other ingredients such as orange juice or zest. Cranberry sauce may be condensed or jellied and thus shaped like a cylinder due to the shape of steel cans that often contain the sauce, or may be loose and uncondensed. In the UK, cranberry sauce is often eaten in conjunction with turkey for Christmas dinner, and it is only rarely eaten in other contexts.
 In the U.S., most cranberry sauce (and cranberry products in general) is produced by the company Ocean Spray.
