Ingredients : 
 green tomatoes  (about 1 -md per serving 
 Bread crumbs 
 REAL Parmesan or  Romano   Cheese —grated. 
 olive oil 
 garlic  cloves 
 angel hair pasta 
 Directions : 
 Slice the  tomatoes  about 1/2 cm thick. (Vary this according to your success at frying the suckers!) Dip in  cream , then in a mixture of bread crumbs and  Cheese —about 50% each. 
 Heat about 50-65 ml  olive oil  in a large skillet or omelet pan until hot, but not smoking. NOTE TO THE NOVICE:  olive oil  smokes easily! Saute'  garlic  until LIGHTLY browned. Ifyou overdo the  garlic , or cook at too high a temperature, it will taste YUCKY! Remove the (oh, yeah....peeled and pureed)  garlic  from the  oil  and discard. Fry the  tomato  slices until crusty and lightly browned on each side. The  tomatoes  should be softened, but not mushy. You will probably find it necessary to make more batches of  garlic   oil  from time to time, as you fry up the slices of  green tomato . This is good. 
 You will finally toss all the (cooked)  Pasta  with the remaining garlic-ky  oil  (there should be plenty of this!). If there is some  cream  left over, a LITTLE of this should go in too. Top with the fried  tomato  slices and a generous helping of shredded  Cheese  and a little bit of bread crumbs.
