 9  egg   yolks 
 1  egg  white 
 2 cups  Sugar 
 2 cups  water 
 1 teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Pumpkin Jam (optional) 100gms 
 Directions : 
 Beat  egg   yolks  until light and frothy, then spoon in the beaten  egg  white. 
 Continue beating until mixture is spongy in texture, then pour into muffin tins that have been buttered. 
 Set tins in a bain-marie (about one inch of hot  water  in a shallow pan) and bake in 350Â° F oven about 15-20 minutes. 
 Dissolve  Sugar  in  water  and bring to a boil, add  vanilla extract . 
 Remove papos de anjo from tins, make 3, 4 holes in each one with a toothpick and drop into boiling syrup. 
 Remove from heat, let cool and place in a pyrex. 
 Refrigerate until next day, so papos will soak in the syrup overnight.
