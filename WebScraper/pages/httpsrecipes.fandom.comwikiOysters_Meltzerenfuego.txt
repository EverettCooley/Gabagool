 Description : 
 This came from Playa Juncalito in Baja California Sur. 
 
 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 12 oysters 
 butter  (I use  ghee ) 
 fresh-minced  garlic  (mince it yourself) 
 fresh herbs ( basil ,  dill , etc) 
 salt 
 pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Prepare a small, safety-first fire. 
 Toss oysters in the fire. 
 Naturally, you will put them in a place where you can get them later so when they start to pop open you can pull them out of the fire and place some of the herbs/ butter / salt / pepper / garlic  mixture (which has already been combined and heating in a pot in the fire) inside the oyster. 
 Place them back in the fire until the mixture begins to boil in the shell. 
 Remove and eat as soon as possible. 
 Whoa. So good.
