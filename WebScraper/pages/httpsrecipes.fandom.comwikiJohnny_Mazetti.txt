Mix those ingredients well. Add sauces and paste then mix again. Put on medium low fire. In another pot, cook noodles—when done, add them to the mixture and stir very well. Place mixture in long oblong pan in layers. On each layer, place shredded  Cheese  but leave enough for the top. 
 Place about 4 teaspoons of  butter  on the top, and put into the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes. Don't worry about leftovers - place portions into ziplock freezer bags (preferable over tinfoil). It freezes well and taste twice as good the next time.
