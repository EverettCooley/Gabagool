 About Soul Food and Southern Cooking Y-Group 
 The focus and purpose of our group is sharing Recipes and Methods of cooking the foods of the heart and soul that we have loved since our childhood. We want you to share recipes of all kinds as long as they come from the heart and are special to you. We are willing to try new things but love the old heritage recipes of our Mothers and Grandmothers, our Fathers and Grandfathers, and other family and friends. Comfort foods are especially welcome. We love all kinds of cooking including Soul Food, Southern Cooking, Deep South, Bar-B-Que (no matter what part of the country it comes from), Country and other recipes of all kinds are welcome. Foods from Texas, New Orleans, Cajun, Creole, Low Country, Gulf Coast, Piedmont, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
