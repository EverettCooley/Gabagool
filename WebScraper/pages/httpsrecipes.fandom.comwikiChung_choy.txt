 About chung choy : 
 These preserved greens are dried with salt.  They may be packaged in two forms: flat leaves or leaves rolled into a ball, both in plastic bags. If the recipe calls for "a ball of chung choy", each ball weighs about 1Â½ ounces.
 Salted "Turnip" is popular in stir-fries, giving them a unique and almost smoky flavor. It is generally chopped fine and added near the end of cooking.
 This form is extremely salty and needs to be rinsed well before use. Kept tightly sealed in a cool dry place this form will keep indefinitely at room temperature. 
 Ingredients: "Turnip", salt, water.
