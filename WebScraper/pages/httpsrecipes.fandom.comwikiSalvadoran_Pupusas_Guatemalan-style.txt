Description : 
 This is an easy tropical dish that is full of flavor! I like to serve it with chips, or as a side dish. It would be easy to try slightly different versions by adding  lime  juice,  ginger ,  pineapple , or jalapenos, depending on your personal taste. If you have any other suggestions, I would love to hear them! Thanks!
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 cups  masa harina   flour 
 4 cups  water , approximately 
 16 – 24 ounces canned  refried beans 
 3 cups soft  white cheese 
 light vegetable  oil  or light olive  oil 
 Directions : 
 In a large mixing bowl, gradually stir  water  into  masa harina  until dough forms a ball that can be handled. 
 Into another bowl, empty the  refried beans . 
 Place the grated  cheese  into a separate bowl. 
 Divide dough into about 25 pieces. 
 Roll each into a ball and flatten between the palms of your hands to about ½-inch thick. 
 Put a spoonful of beans and a small handful of  cheese  into the center of each pupusa. 
 Flatten again with the filling inside. 
 Heat a heavy, wide-bottomed or flat skillet until hot. 
 Brush with  oil  and cook pupusas on each side 4 – 5 minutes until a pale golden-brown. 
 The outside should be firm.
