 4 tablespoons  butter

 Directions : 
 This is a thick rich soup, and very much a local specialty (LOMBARDY). 
 Tripe is usually sold "dressed", i.e. cleaned and almost completely cooked. 
 It may have to be blanched simply for extra cleaning but even thisis seldom necessary. 
 The butcher selling the tripe should know how much it has been processed. 
 Wash the tripe and cut into 3-ingh squares. 
 Put it into a pan togetherwith the  onions  stuck with cloves, 1 stalk of  celery , chopped, a little  salt  and enough  water  to cover. 
 Put on the lid and bring to the boil, then lower the heat to moderate and cook for two hours, or until the tripe is quite tender. 
 Take it from the pan, cool it and cut into narrow strips. 
 Melt the  butter  and  Pork  fat in another pan. 
 Fry the  onions , the remaining  celery ,  carrots  and  sage , stirring to mix thoroughly. 
 As the vegetables begin to brown, add the  tomatoes . 
 Cook over a moderate heat for 10 minutes, add the tripe, a little saltand  pepper , and 2/3 cup hot  water . 
 Bring to the booil and cook for further 30 minutese. 
 Finally add the beans, check seasoning and cook gently for another 15 minutes to bring out flavours. 
 Sprinkle generously with Parmesan before serving.
