 Ingredients : 
 8 oz (250 g )  ginger  root 
 2 tablespoons  mirin 
 2 tablespoons of  sake 
 5 teaspoons  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Scrub the ginger under running water as you would a potato for baking. 
 Blanch it in boiling water for one minute and drain. 
 Peel and slice thinly, i used a potato peeler for the slices and well as peeling. 
 Combine mirin, sake, and sugar in a small pan. 
 Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. 
 Cool. 
 Place the ginger into a sterilized jar and pour the cooled vinegar over the ginger. 
 Cover and keep 3 â€“ 4 days before using. 
 Will keep refrigerated for up to one month. 
 The pale pink color develops as it ages, however, you might want to add a small amount of red food coloring.
