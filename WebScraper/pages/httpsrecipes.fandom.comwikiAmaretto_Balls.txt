One Christmas Eve I had to work, but I took a break to pop in a bookstore. They were having an open house, and I managed to snarf a lot of these morsels during those stolen minutes! After Christmas I came back to hunt down the clerk who brought these—my finest bit of sleuthing yet... 
 These are equally enjoyed and requested by my friends. Although some have tried other liqueurs - including  Bourbon  - the results are never as good as the original! I substitute Oreos for the wafers, plus use only 1⅓ cup confectioners' sugar; don't worry about the cookies' filling because it is nothing more than confectioners' sugar.
 
 Yield: not nearly enough. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  pecans , chopped finely 
 2 cups  confectioner's sugar , sifted 
 2 cups  chocolate wafer  crumbs 
 ⅔ cup  amaretto 
 pecans , additional 
 Directions : 
 Process  pecans  and wafers separately; combine in food processor with  sugar . 
 Slowly pour in liqueur until mixture forms a ball. 
 You might not need the whole amount, depending on the humidity level. 
 If mixture gets too wet, put it in the refrigerator - uncovered - overnight to dry out some. 
 Shape into small balls; roll in additional finely chopped  pecans . 
 Store in tightly sealed container.
