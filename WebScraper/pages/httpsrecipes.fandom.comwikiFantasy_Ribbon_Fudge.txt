Description : 
 The best chips to be used are either the semi-sweet or double  chocolate  by Girardelli. I have also used Nestle and Hershey's. And, the  vanilla  has to be pure not imitation for best results. Also, for best results, use a wooden spoon (for keeping an even temperature) and a non-stick pot.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 (7 ounces) jar  marshmallow  cream 
 1 (11.5 ounces) package  chocolate chips 
 ⅔ cup unsweetened  evaporated milk 
 ¾ cup  peanut butter 
 2 teaspoons  vanilla 
 3 cups  sugar 
 12 tablespoons  butter 
 Directions : 
 Mix 1½ cups  sugar  and ⅓ cup  milk  in pan,and 6 tablespoons of  butter  stirring on medium heat to boil, then reduce heat to med-low, set timer for 4 minutes stir continuously. 
 Immediately remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon  vanilla  and quickly add ½ jar of  marshmallow , ¾ bag of  chocolate chips . 
 Add ¾ bag of  chocolate chips , mix vigorously til creamy and there are no hints of  marshmallow . 
 Pour into 9 x 13-inch pan for thin fudge, and an 8x8 pan for thick fudge. 
 Repeat instructions listed, adding the  peanut   butter , in place of the  chocolate chips . 
 Pour over  chocolate  fudge let cool completely, and keep refrigerated. 
 Hint : make sure that your  butter ,  sugar ,  milk  is at a rolling boil before setting your timer. 
 Add,  vanilla , fluff, then the chips in that order.
