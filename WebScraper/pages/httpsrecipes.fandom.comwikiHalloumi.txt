 About Haloumi : 
 Halloumi or haloumi (Greek χαλούμι, Turkish hellim, Arabic حلوم ḥallūm) is a traditional Cypriot cheese that is also popular in the rest of the Middle East and Greece, and is now made the world over. It is made from a mixture of goat's and sheep milk, although some halloumi can be bought that also contains cow's milk. It has a high melting point, and so can easily be fried or grilled. Halloumi is set with rennet, and is unusual in that no acid or acid-producing bacterium is used in its preparation.
 A cheese that was traditionally made with sheep or goat's milk, but today is most often made with cow's milk. The cheese originated in Cyprus, but is also made in Lebanon and Romania. Somewhat similar to Mozzarella, it has a rubbery texture with a bland flavor and is primarily used as a cooking cheese, holding its shape well when heated. Often referred to as a "stretched curd" cheese, the Halloumi curds are heated in water or whey, kneaded and then rolled out into a slab that is cut into blocks to be stored in brine until ready for packaging or use. After the cheese is heated, fresh mint is chopped and mixed into the cheese, giving it a herbal and subdued salty flavor that comes from the brine, but generally the flavor is mellow and somewhat tangy. To reduce the saltiness, wash the brine off cheese after it is removed from the package or add a little lemon juice and olive oil to the cheese.
