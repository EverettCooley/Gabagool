 Wikipedia Article  About Scotch whisky on Wikipedia 
 Scotch whisky is a whisky made in Scotland. In North America, the term is often abbreviated to "Scotch". In Great Britain, the term whisky almost always refers to Scotch whisky, and the term "Scotch" is rarely used by itself.
 Scotch whisky is divided into at least three distinct categories: single malt, vatted malt (also called "pure malt") and blended.
 Due to an issue with the confusing and misleading term "Pure Malt", the Scotch Whisky Association recently introduced new terminology, whereby a "Vatted Malt" is to be referred to as a "Blended Malt" this has met with much push-back from the industry.
