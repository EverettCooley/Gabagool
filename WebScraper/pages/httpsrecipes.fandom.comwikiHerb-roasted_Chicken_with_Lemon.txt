 Description : 
       Herb-roasted Chicken with Lemon     
 The easiest way to know when a  chicken  is done is to use an instant-read meat thermometer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  chicken  (about 3 pounds), washed and patted dry 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon  black pepper 
 2 teaspoons chopped fresh herb (i.e.  thyme ,  parsley ,  sage , etc.) or 1 teaspoon dried 
 1  lemon , sliced into rounds, intact 
 2 tablespoons  butter 
 ¾ cup reduced sodium  chicken broth 
 Directions : 
 Heat oven to 350°F. 
 Sprinkle  chicken  with  salt ,  pepper  and herb, inside and out. 
 Loosen skin from breast with an index finger, and stuff 2 slices of  lemon  and 1 tablespoon  butter  onto each side of the breast. 
 Place remaining  lemon  in the cavity. 
 Transfer  chicken  to a roasting pan. 
 Roast 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes; basting occasionally. 
 An instant meat thermometer should read 170°F in the thickest part of the thigh (not touching bone). 
 Transfer  chicken  to a cutting board; wait 10 minutes before carving to allow juices to redistribute. 
 Pour off fat from pan. 
 Place pan over 2 oven burners; pour in  chicken broth  and bring to a boil. 
 Scrape up brown bits on bottom of pan. 
 Cook 2 – 3 minutes. 
 Pour over carved  chicken .
