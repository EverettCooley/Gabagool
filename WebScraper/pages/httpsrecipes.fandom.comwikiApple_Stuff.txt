Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Apples  for baking. I use Stayman rather than Grannysmiths. 
 Honey 
 Roasted  nuts  I use  hazelnuts  though  walnuts  work too. 
 cinnamon 
 nutmeg 
 black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Peel and cut the  Apples  into small pieces placing them in a nonstick baking dish or a lightly greased baking dish. 
 Add enough  Honey  to coat the  Apples . 
 Cinnamon  and  nutmeg  to taste. A dash of  black pepper . 
 Add  nuts . Mix thoroughly. Bake at 350F until  Apples  are soft. 
 Stir occasionally while cooking to keep  Honey  mixed and not pooled at the bottom. 
 If you want to roast your own  nuts .... buy whole  nuts  and grind in a mortar and pestle. 
 Cook over med heat on stove in a pan lightly greased with  olive oil .
