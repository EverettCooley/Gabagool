Description : 
       Dalmatian Brodetto     
 Fish stew. The best brodetto is made using assorted fish of various kinds, e.g. rockfish, dent fish, sea bass,  dory , conger eel and tuna. Brodetto is best served with boiled maize-flour (corn meal), rice or spaghetti (pasta). 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 kg various fish ( rockfish ,  sea bass ,  conger eel ,  tuna , etc.) 
 ⅛ l  olive oil  (per kilo of fish) 
 1  onion 
 parsley 
 salt 
 pepper 
 several fresh  tomatoes 
 1 teaspoonful  tomato juice 
 vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Cut the bigger fish into slices, leaving the smaller ones whole. 
 Fry a chopped onion in oil, add fish and fry it a while, adding chopped garlic and parsley. 
 Put in some salt and pepper and 1 tea spoonful of concentrate tomato juice and, depending on the season, some sliced fresh tomatoes. 
 Cover the fish with water and let it boil before adding the vinegar. 
 Cook for 1 – 1,5 hours, letting it simmer over a low fire. 
 Do not stir - shake the casserole gently instead so that the ingredients should remain in layers in the same order they have been added.
