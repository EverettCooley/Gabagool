Description : 
 This is one of the many recipes for Moroccan crepes or pancakes, but this is a dessert. Try it filled with crushed almonds and oranges!
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 400g soaked  semolina 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 50g  Sugar 
 100g softened  butter 
 3/4 glass  water 
 Directions : 
 Mix the semolina, salt and sugar together in a bowl, and then add the butter. When it is blended well, knead the mixture with damp hands so the dough doesn't stick. Make sure the dough stays moist.
 Split the dough into portions and manipulate into pancakes about 1Â cm. To cook, grill them for about 8 minutes on each side, or until they are golden.
 This recipe serves 6 to 8.
