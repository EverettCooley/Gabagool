 Description : 
 This recipe came from an Estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Mahan Estate in Dallas, Texas in 1988.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup crumbled basil and tomato  feta  cheese 
 2 tablespoons  cream cheese 
 4 skinless boneless  chicken breast  halves 
 ½ teaspoon  black pepper 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  olive oil 
 ¼ cup  chicken broth 
 10 ounce package pre-washed fresh  spinach  trimmed 
 2 tablespoons  pecan  pieces toasted 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 lemon  slices halved 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl combine feta cheese and cream cheese then set aside. 
 Using a sharp knife cut a horizontal slit through the thickest portion of each chicken breast half to form a pocket. 
 Stuff pockets with the cheese mixture. 
 If necessary secure openings with wooden toothpicks. 
 Sprinkle chicken with pepper and salt. 
 In a large nonstick skillet cook chicken in hot oil over medium-high heat about 12 minutes or until tender and no longer pink turning once. 
 Remove chicken from skillet then cover and keep warm. 
 Carefully add chicken broth to skillet and bringing to boiling then add half of the spinach. 
 Cover and cook 3 minutes. 
 Remove spinach from skillet reserving liquid in pan. 
 Repeat with remaining spinach. 
 Return all spinach to skillet. 
 Stir in the nuts and lemon juice. 
 To serve divide spinach mixture among 4 dinner plates. 
 Top with chicken breasts and garnish with lemon slices.
