      Xynotyro     
 A Greek cheese made from sheep's and goat's milk. It is an unpasteurized whey cheese with a distinctive sweet and sour flavor. Xynotyro cheese is drained and cured in reed baskets and the finished cheese comes in various shapes with markings on the surface produced from its contact with the reed baskets. Xynotyro is best when used as an addition to salads as well as an ingredient in various baked dishes.
