      Austrian Daily Bread     
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  whole wheat "bread" flour 
 2 cups unbleached white  all purpose flour 
 Â½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon dry baking  yeast 
 2 tablespoons  blackstrap molasses  or  honey  (optional) 
 2 tablespoons  gluten flour  (optional, rises much, much better) 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. 
 Add the honey or  molasses . 
 Begin adding  water  in small amounts, kneading with your hands until a  bread dough  consistency (smooth, not sticky-wet) is achieved. 
 Kneading should take approximately half an hour. 
 Tom usually kneads until  the Simpsons  is over! Form and smooth the bread into a suitable loaf shape for your bread pan. 
 Place the loaf in the pan, cover the pan and let it sit in a warm spot for an hour and a half. 
 If you kneaded it for a full half hour it should rise very nicely. 
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
 Lightly  flour  the outside of the loaf once more to make sure it doesn't stick. 
 Bake the loaf for 50 minutes.
