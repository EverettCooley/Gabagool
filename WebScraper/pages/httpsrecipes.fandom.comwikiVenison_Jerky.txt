       Venison Jerky     
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb.  ground venison 
 2 tsp.  salt 
 ¼ tsp.  cayenne pepper 
 ¼ tsp.  white pepper 
 ½ tsp.  garlic powder 
 1 tsp.  dry mustard 
 2 tbsp.  brown sugar 
 3 tsp.  liquid smoke 
 Directions : 
 Combine ground venison and all spices. Mix very thoroughly. 
 Roll mixture out between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper until it is about ⅛ inch thick. 
 Use a  butter  or chef's knife and cut meat into 1 inch wide strips 4 – 6 inches long. 
 Set the dehydrator to 140°F; it should take about 6 – 8 hours. 
 Take a bite and test for texture. It should only be good and chewy, never mushy, and never brittle.
