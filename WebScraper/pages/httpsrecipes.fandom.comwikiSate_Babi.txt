Description : 
       Sate Babi     
 This is what we call a sweet sate and the  chili paste  that I add does not really belong in this recipe. Here it usually served with a ketjap  peanut  sauce and prawn crackers, it can be an appetizer, snack or a side dish when part of an Indonesian rijsttafel. If you cannot get the sweet soy sauce, use regular and add some  brown sugar . Marinating time is not included.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ lbs  pork tenderloins 
 1 small  onion , grated 
 1 – 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 ½ cup  ketjap manis , sweet soy sauce 
 salt 
 white pepper 
 2 teaspoons  ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons ground  cumin 
 ½ tablespoon  lemon juice 
 1 – 2 teaspoons  sambal oelek  or  chili paste  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  pork  up, into cubes. 
 Make a marinade from the remaining ingredients. 
 Add the meat and leave to marinate for 30 minutes minimum. 
 Skewer the meat onto metal or bamboo/wooden skewers, if you use the wooden soak for half an hour in  water , keep the marinade. 
 Roast them under a grill, in a grill pan or best of all on the barbeque until done, usually about ten minutes or shorter. 
 Baste with the remaining marinade during cooking.
