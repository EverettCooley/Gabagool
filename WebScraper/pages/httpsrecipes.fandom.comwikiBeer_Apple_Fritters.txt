 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  maple syrup 
 2  eggs 
 ½ cup maple  beer  or amber  ale 
 1 cup  flour 
 1 cup  semolina  flour 
 1 tablespoon  white sugar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 5 large  Granny Smith apples 
 2 tablespoons melted  butter 
 3 cups  vegetable oil  for deep frying 
 powdered  maple sugar  granules 
 Directions : 
 Sift the dry ingredients into a 2 quart mixing bowl. 
 Blend the liquid ingredients then mix all ingredients well and let the batter rest in the refrigerator for an hour or more. 
 Peel core and dice the apples. 
 Toss in melted butter then stir gently into the batter making sure apples are evenly coated. 
 Bring the oil to 375°F in a large deep heavy skillet. 
 Prepare a baking sheet lined with brown paper or paper toweling and place in a 150°F oven. 
 Drop tablespoons of fritter batter with several chunks of apple in a tablespoon into the hot oil and fry on both sides until browned and crispy about 3 minutes total. 
 Let oil return to 375°F between batches. 
 Use tongs to place the cooked fritters on paper lined baking sheet in slow oven to drain off excess oil and keep warm. 
 Serve with a dusting of maple sugar.
