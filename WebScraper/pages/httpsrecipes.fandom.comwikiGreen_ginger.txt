 About green ginger : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Green Ginger on Wikipedia 
 Ginger root is used extensively as a spice in many if not most cuisines of the world. Though called a root, it is actually the rhizome of the monocotyledonous perennial plant Zingiber officinale.
 The English word ginger is derived from Dravidian: akin to Tamil iñci (இஞ்சி)
 The word "ginger" can also be used as slang to describe red haired people, or vernacular for something that is particularly savory, sexual, or pleasing.
