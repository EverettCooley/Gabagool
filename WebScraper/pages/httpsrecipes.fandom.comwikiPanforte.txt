Because this confection is a specialty of Siena, Italy, it's also called Siena cake. This dense, flat cake is rich with honey, hazelnuts, almonds, candied Citron, citrus peel, cocoa and spices. It contains only a tiny amount of flour-just enough to hold the fruits and nuts together. After baking, panforte becomes hard and chewy.
