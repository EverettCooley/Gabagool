 Wikipedia Article  About Wheat berries on Wikipedia 
 Whole wheat flour is a powdery substance derived by grinding or mashing the whole wheat berry. It is used in baking but typically mixed with other "white" flours to add nutrition, texture, fiber, and body to the finished product. Usually, the whole wheat flour is not the main ingredients of baked goods due to its quality to add texture and a certain "heaviness" to baked goods which prevents them from rising as well as white flours. This adds to the cost per volume of the baked item as it requires more flour to obtain the same volume due to the fewer and smaller air pockets trapped in the raised goods.
