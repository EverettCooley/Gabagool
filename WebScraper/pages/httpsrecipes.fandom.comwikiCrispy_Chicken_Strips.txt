 Ingredients : 
 12  chicken  strips (or 3 large-sized boneless  chicken  breasts cut into 4 strips each) 
 oil  for frying 
 2  eggs 
 1 cup  breadcrumbs 
 Marinade : 
 1 tablespoon light cooking  oil 
 1 teaspoon red  chili powder 
 ¼ teaspoon  turmeric  powder 
 ¼ teaspoon dry  mango  powder ( amchoor ) 
 1 teaspoon  ginger - garlic  paste 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Mix  chicken  strips in a large bowl with all the marinade ingredients and let sit for an hour. 
 In a bowl beat 2  eggs  and set aside 
 Heat  oil  in a pan and wait till  oil  is really hot. 
 Dip each  chicken  strip first into beaten  egg , and then into bread crumbs to nicely coat each strip. 
 Fry  chicken  strips till brown and crispy. Serve with big bowl or french fries and  ketchup  and enjoy!! 
 Spicy Notes : 
 If you want to avoid the use of excessive  oil  while frying, this dish can be altered by putting it in a 375 °F oven on broil for 15 – 20 mins till  chicken  is crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.
