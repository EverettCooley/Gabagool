 ¼ cup  flour 
 3 Tbsp  breadcrumbs 
 3 Tbsp  cornstarch

 2 tsp  salt 
 1½ tsp  pepper

 Mash with a fork until a dough forms. 
 Roll dough out between two pieces of waxed paper to ¼ inch thick. 
 Carefully peel off the top piece of waxed paper. 
 Cut out 1½-inch circles, using the rim of a glass. 
 Using the end of a drinking straw, cut out two circles for the eyes 
 Use a spoon to cut out a mouth. 
 Pour canola oil into a large pot to a depth of 2 inches. 
 Heat until it reaches 350°F on a deep-fry thermometer. (Or add a pinch of dough to the oil; when it sizzles, the oil is ready.)
