 Description : 
 If you have access to fresh figs when they come into season, I highly suggest preparing this as a fancy, but simple appetizer to serve before any rich main course. You may use any type of fig, including the dark purple, yellowish green or green-skinned varieties. You may use any other type of blue cheese if you cannot find Roquefort - a good Stilton or Gorgonzola are equally good options.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8  figs 
 3 oz.  prosciutto 
 3 tbsp.  honey 
 3 oz.  Roquefort  cheese 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the broiler. Quarter the figs and place on a foil lined grill rack. 
 Tear each slice of prosciutto into two or three pieces and crumple them up on the foil beside the figs. Brush the figs with 1 tbsp. of the honey and cook under the broiler until lightly browned. 
 Crumble the Roquefort cheese and divide among four plates, setting it to one side. Add the honey-grilled figs and ham and pour over any cooking juices caught on the foil. 
 Drizzle the remaining honey over the figs, ham and cheese. Serve seasoned with plenty of freshly ground black pepper.
