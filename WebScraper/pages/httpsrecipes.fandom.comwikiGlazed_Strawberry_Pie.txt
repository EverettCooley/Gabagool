I make this every summer! It's an awesome seasonal recipe - and
soooooo easy!
 1 QT ripe strawberries
3 TBS cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1 9 inch baked pie shell
1 TBS lemon juice
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup sugar
whipped cream for topping.
 Cut half of berries in half, reserving 6 small berries with stems left
on for garnish. Put halved berries in pie shell. Crush remaining
berries and combine with sugar, water, cornstarch, lemon juice and
salt: cook until thick and clear. Cool. Pour cooked mix over berries in
pie shell. Chill. Put a ring of whipped cream around top of pie and
decorate with the reserved berries and serve.
Enjoy!
