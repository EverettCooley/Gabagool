Hard-boiled eggs are boiled for longer than soft-boiled eggs, long enough for the yolk to solidify. They can be eaten warm or cold. Hard-boiled eggs are the basis for many dishes, such as egg salad, Cobb salad and Scotch eggs, and may be further prepared as deviled eggs.
 Hard-boiled eggs are commonly sliced, particularly for use in sandwiches. For this purpose specialized  egg slicers  exist, to ease slicing and yield even slices.
