 Filling : 
 1 (14 ounce) can of  sweetened condensed milk 
 ½ cup  key lime juice 
 2  egg yolks 
 1  egg 
 1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

 2  egg whites 
 4 tablespoons white  sugar

 Mix in egg yolks and whole egg.

 Refrigerate for two hours. 
 Prepare Meringue:
 Always use glass or stainless steel for meringue. Plastic absorbs oils which will prevent the meringue from setting, and copper reacts with egg whites and turns them gray. 
 Beat egg whites until foamy. 
 Gradually add sugar, and continue to beat until whites form stiff peaks. 
 Spread or spoon meringue over pie, covering completely 
 Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Chill before serving. 
 Enjoy.
