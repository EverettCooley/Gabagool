 Description : 
 Texture is similar to that of pizza dough, or bread sticks, but with many fragrant spices. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tbl  active dry yeast 
 1/4 cup Warm  water 
 2 tbl Ground coriander 
 1 tsp Ground  cardamom 
 1/2 tsp  white pepper 
 1 tsp Ground  fenugreek 
 2 tsp  salt 
 1/3 cup  vegetable oil 
 1 1/4 cup Lukewarm  water 
 5 cup  unbleached flour 
 Topping : 
 1 tbl  Cayenne 
 2 tbl  oil 
 1/4 tsp  ground ginger 
 1 pch Ground cloves 
 1/8 tsp  cinnamon 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve the  yeast  in warm  water  for 10 minutes. Add the coriander,  cinnamon ,  white pepper ,  fenugreek ,  salt ,  oil  and lukewarm  water , and stir well. Slowly add the  flour  until a mass forms. On a floured board, knead the dough for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and tiny bubbles form. 
 (note: this recipe makes a stickier dough than usual) 
 Reserve a 1-inch piece of dough. With floured hands spread the dough out on an ungreased pizza pan. Using a sharp knife, score the dough in a design similar to the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Place the reserved ball of dough in the center of the scored dough. Cover and let rise one hour. 
 Bake at 350F for an hour or until golden brown. Combine the topping ingredients (cayenne, oil, ground ginger, ground cloves, cinnamon) in a small bowl. While still warm brush the bread with topping. 
 Yield: 1 16-inch loaf.
