Description : 
 this is my own version of dipping sauce. the best version is my mom's but since she never measures and is too swift in the kitchen to get down the exact proportions *she always gives me amounts like it should be THIS much in your palm...lmbo like what am i supposed to do with that kind of measuring system?* this is the next best thing and second best is just as good,...right? ;-)
 
       Dipping sauce(korean)     
 Ingredients : 
 6 tablespoons  soy sauce  (I use Kikkoman) 
 3 tablespoons  water 
 1 tablespoon  rice vinegar  or  cider vinegar 
 1 tablespoon  sesame oil 
 1 tablespoon  granulated sugar 
 ¼ teaspoon ground  black pepper 
 1 clove  garlic , crushed 
 1 bunch  green onions , chopped 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients together and let sit for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before serving to let the flavors blend. 
 This will be heavy in the  green onion  department so if you don't want as much cut it down a little but we love them and the  green onions  are what all of us go for first. 
 This is great with any kind of steamed or fried dumpling (like Chinese dumplings or Korean mandu).
