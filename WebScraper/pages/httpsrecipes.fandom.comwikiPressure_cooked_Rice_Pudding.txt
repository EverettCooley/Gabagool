Pressure cooked Rice Pudding
Serves 4
 Creamy and comforting. It's preferable to eat it the same day or the
rice may become chewy.
1 tablespoon (15 ml) butter
1/4 cup (60 ml) long grain rice
2 cups (500 ml) milk
1 cup (250 ml) water
1/3 (75 ml) sugar 	1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) salt
1 egg
1/4 cup (60 ml) evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) vanilla
Cinnamon
 Directions:
 Melt the butter in the pressure cooker and stir in the rice, coating
it with the butter. Pour in the fresh milk and water, then stir in
the sugar and salt. Lock the lid in place and bring to pressure, then
lower heat and cook for suggested time. Allow pressure to drop using
the natural release method [1] and remove the lid.
 In a small bowl mix together the egg, evaporated milk and vanilla. 
Stir in a little of the hot liquid from the pressure cooker, then add
the mixture to the pressure cooker. Cook, uncovered, over medium
heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the rice pudding
just barely begins to bubble. Remove immediately from the heat. Cool
10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 Transfer to individual dessert bowls, continue cooling, then
refrigerate. Serve sprinkled with cinnamon.
 Suggested time for 15 psi pressure cookers Cook for 12 minutes on high
pressure.
