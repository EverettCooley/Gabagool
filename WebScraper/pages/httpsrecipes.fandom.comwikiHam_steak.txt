      Ham steak     
 A ham steak is a sliced piece of ham, usually ranging in thickness from about 0.5-2 inches (1.27-5.08 cm). It is normally just a cut piece off the ham shank or leg, and can be convenient to use when you’d like a little ham, but don’t wish to prepare a whole ham roast. Most ham steaks are not cooked, so though they may look like deli “boiled” ham, be sure to heat them thoroughly before eating them. 
 You’ll find ham steak in both bone-in and boneless versions. Most of them are also heavily salted, and the amount of salt in the steak varies significantly with brand. A general rule is that generic and off brands tend to be saltier. In fact, some may find them simply too salty. There is a way to rescue a ham steak you think will be salty. You can soak it in water for about 10 minutes prior to cooking it. This will remove some of the excess salt but still leave you with a very tasty steak.
