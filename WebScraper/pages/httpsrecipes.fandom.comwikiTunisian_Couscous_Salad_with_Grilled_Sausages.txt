 Description : 
 Tunisian  couscous  Salad with Grilled Sausages
 
 Ingredients : 
 For  couscous :
 
 5 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1-1/3 cups  couscous 
 1 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1/4 teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 3/4 teaspoon  salt 
 1 cup  tomato juice 
 1 cup  water 
 For Sausages:
 
 1 pound mild or hot Italian sausages or a combination 
 1 tablespoon  lemon juice 
 1  tomato , diced 
 1/2 cup chopped  cilantro  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 FOR  couscous : In a large frying pan with a lid, heat 1 tablespoon of the  oil  over moderately low heat. Add the  garlic ,  couscous ,  cumin ,  Cayenne , and 1/2 teaspoon of the  salt  to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the  couscous  starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the  tomato juice  and  water . Bring to a simmer. Cover, remove from the heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Transfer the  couscous  to a platter or a large glass or stainless-steel bowl to cool.
 FOR SAUSAGES: Meanwhile, light the grill or heat the broiler. Coat the sausages with 1/2 tablespoon of the  oil . Grill or broil the sausages, turning occasionally, until completely cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. When the sausages are cool enough to handle, cut them into thin slices.
 TO SERVE: Toss the cooled  couscous  with the  lemon juice , the remaining 3-1/2 tablespoons  oil  and 1/4 teaspoon  salt , and the  tomato . Top with the sliced sausages and the  cilantro .
 WINE RECOMMENDATION: Australian  Shiraz  is an all-purpose red that marries particularly well with anything from the grill. It offers lots of ripe  blackberry  flavor,  pepper  nuances, and a soft, lush texture.
