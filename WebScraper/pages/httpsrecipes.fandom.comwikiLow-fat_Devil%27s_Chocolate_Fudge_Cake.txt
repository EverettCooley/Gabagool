Description : 
 This recipe for all of you healthy  chocolate  freaks. Note at the bottom, there is a method for making  prune puree  (very similar to the wonderslim product that no one can find). This recipe comes from an article about fruit, since it uses  prune puree  instead of fat. My one gripe, about which i have written to the paper, is that they do not do a nutritional analysis of a recipe, even though they call it low-fat. However, those of us who are experienced in baking low-fat can see that there is little fat in this cake.
