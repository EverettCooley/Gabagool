 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup  rice flour 
 ¼ cup  potato starch 
 ½ cup  tapioca starch 
 2 teaspoon  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  xanthan gum 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 2  eggs 
 ⅓ cup  oil 
 ½ cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 400 °F. 
 Mix the first 7 ingredients. 
 In a separate bowl mix the eggs, oil and milk *mix wet ingredients with dry ingredients. 
 Spray cookie sheet with PAM and then spray inside of muffin rings. 
 Put two very large spoonfuls of batter in each, make sure the rings aren't to close to each other. 
 Sprinkle with  sesame seeds . 
 And bake immediately for 13–15 minutes, until buns are nice and golden-brown on top. 
 Variations :

 For hot dogs: Add ¼ - ½ teaspoon more of the  xanthan gum  to the batter, and on greased cookie sheet, spoon batter in an oblong shape, about 5-inches long; sprinkle with  sesame seeds , and bake immediately. Let cool completely, wrap individually in Saran wrap, and place in a freezer bag and freeze. When they are thawed, microwave one for about 15–20 seconds, just long enough to warm them.
