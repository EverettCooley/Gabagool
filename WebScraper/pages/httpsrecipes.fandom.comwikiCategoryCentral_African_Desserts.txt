 Central African Republic cuisine is quite an original one. The most popular deserts there are probably the fruit salads that come in very many shapes and forms. After a hot, dry summer day one can understand the need of a wonderful and juicy bowl of fruits. Besides fruits, there are also other things that people here put in the fruit salads such as various spices and sweet sauces. Another very popular dessert in Central African Republisc is the Sago pudding, also known as Melkos, which is a traditional dessert probably in many other African countries. The dessert is supposed to be served with the custard. The dessertâ€™s ingredients are sago, milk, eggs, water, custard powder, salt and sugar. Another very delicious and unusual Central African dessert is the date and banana squares, which is actually a sort of a pie that is cut into small square pieces.
