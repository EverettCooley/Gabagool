 The most common ingredients belonging to classic French Canadian cuisine are goose, duck, rabbit and maple syrup. A delicious speciality from Quebec is Tourtiere which is a stuffed meat pie that traditionally served after midnight mass on Christmas Eve and other special occasions. The ingredients needed to cook Tourtieres are onions, garlic, potatoes, salt, pork, celery seed, dried sage, black pepper, eggs, water, flour, pastry and it can be served with chilli sauce. 
Any meat dish can be transformed in a vegetarian speciality, including fish. Thus, for a delightful fish dish you can try baked salmon Italianne; first of all, you have to combine ¼ cup sugar-free mayonnaise and 2 spoons of ketchup in order to obtain a Russian Dressing; then, in a microwave-safe bowl you combine 6 pieces of sun-dried tomatoes and then you add water to cover them. After you heat the tomatoes, you lay salmon pieces in your dish and cover them with Russian Dressing; then you cut the tomatoes and put them top of the dressing and after this you sprinkle the entire dish with ¼ cup chopped onion and bacon.
