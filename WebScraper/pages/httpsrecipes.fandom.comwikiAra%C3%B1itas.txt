 Description : 
 A fried  plantain  "bird's nest"
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 or 4 large green  plantains 
 Adobo  or seasoning to taste ( garlic salt , ground  pepper , ground  oregano ) 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  plantains . Discard the rinds. 
 Grate using the largest blades in your manual grater or its equivalent in any of the mechanical grating devices. Leave the pieces as long as you possibly can. 
 Season thoroughly, to taste 
 Fry in very hot  oil , a few pieces at a time. Don't worry if they all get tangled together and look like a bird's nest. That's part of the effect. Remove them when they are golden in color and set over paper towels to soak the frying  oil . 
 Use them as a side dish as a tasty substitute for French fries or serve them on their own as appetizers. Careful: they are very addictive!
