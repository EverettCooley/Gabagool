Prep Time: 
 Cook Time:  1 Hour
 Yields:  4 Servings
 
 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup water 
 3 tablespoons Armenian coffee 
 3 lumps Sugar 
 1 Teaspoon Cardamom 
 Directions : 
 Measure one demi-tasse cup of water for each cup desired into the "Imrik", and heat it until it is lukewarm. 
 Add one heaped teaspoon of Armenian coffee and one teaspoon sugar for each cup, and stir it. Amounts may vary according to taste. 
 As the mixture begins to boil, a thick foam should form. Stir it once or twice. As the foam begins to rise, take the pot off the heat, so that the foam will sink down. 
 Put it on again; a moment later the foam will rise again. Do this three times so that the coffee grains are well cooked. Now it is ready to serve. 
 Pour a little foam in all of the cups first, then pour the remainder of coffee, filling to the brim. 
 Add the cardamom with the coffee grinds in order to make it properly.
