 Even if Ghana is famous for its meat stews, vegetarians can eat a wide range of soups or main courses made of local plants. The variety of eatable fruits, exotic vegetables, leaves and plants, the replacement of fat with olive, palm and peanut oil makes many dishes to be vegetarian in the Ghanan cuisine. The plantain, fried or boiled is served as a main course and as a vegetarian dish. The tatale, or the Ghanan plantain cakes are made of ripe plantains, chopped or grated onion, flour, palm oil and salt is served hot as the main vegetarian course. The gari foto is another vegetarian dish, which is also a side dish for stew. The gari foto is prepared with fresh tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms, green peppers and vegetable stock or water hot pepper. The vegetarian bhajee (the bhajee also has a meat version) is made of Spanish onions, chickpeas, canned tomatoes, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, coriander, cayenne and black pepper.
