 Wikipedia Article  About Lime peel on Wikipedia 
 Zest is the outer, colored shell of the citrus fruit and is always used for baking. The zest has become a synonym for spice, strong flavor, or interesting taste. To remove the entire zest, a zester, vegetable/potato peeler, or paring knife should get used to scrape the colored part of the peel off. The white membrane or pericarp under the zest is bitter, so it is important to be careful to not cut too deep.
