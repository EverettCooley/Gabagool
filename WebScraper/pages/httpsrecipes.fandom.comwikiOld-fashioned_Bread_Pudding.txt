Description : 
 Adapted from the 1956 Betty Crocker cookbook
 
 Serves 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 
 3 cups soft bread cubes, use 4 cups for a firmer pudding 
 2 cups  milk  scalded with ¼ cup  butter 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 2  eggs , slightly beaten 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon  or  nutmeg 
 ½ cup seedless  raisins 
 Directions : 
 Add bread cubes to a greased 1½-quart baking dish. 
 Whisk together milk, butter, sugar, eggs, salt and cinnamon or nutmeg. 
 Add raisins. 
 Pour over bread cubes and gently combine. 
 Place in a pan of hot water. 
 Bake at 350 °F for 40 to 45 minutes. 
 Variations : 
 Chocolate:  Add ½ cup  chocolate chips  instead of raisins. Omit the spices. (Cinnamon does taste good with this variation though I have tried it). 
 Butterscotch:  Use  brown sugar  instead of granulated sugar. 
 Notes : 
 You can use  non-fat dry milk  in place of regular milk. If you do this, whisk together the milk and water to make 2 cups. Add the butter. Heat until steaming in a microwave-safe measuring cup in the microwave oven. Follow directions as given.
