 1 cup  sugar 
 ½ cup  brown sugar 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  cinnamon 
 1 tablespoon ground  oregano 
 ½ cup  water 
 12 ounces  blackberries  fresh or frozen 
 3 tablespoons  chocolate syrup 
 2 cup chopped  pecans , toasted 
 Directions : 
 Place chipotles in a saucepan then cover with  water  and bring to a boil. 
 Cover and boil until tender about 15 minutes then drain. 
 Set aside to cool. 
 Finely dice the rehydrated chipotles and combine with serranos, sugars,  salt ,  cinnamon ,  oregano  and  water  in a medium saucepan. 
 Bring mixture to a low boil then cook until thickened slightly stirring frequently.
