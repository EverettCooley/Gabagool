 nuts  Ghanaian Ghana African
 
 Ingredients : 
 3Â lb  Chicken , cut into pieces 
 1/2 A whole  Onion 
 2 tbl  tomato  paste 
 1 tbl  peanut oil  or other light cooking  oil 
 1 cup  Onion , well chopped 
 1 cup  tomatoes , chopped 
 2/3 cup  Peanut   butter 
 2 tsp  salt 
 2 tsp Grated  fresh ginger , 
 2 Hot chilies, crushed, 
 1 tsp  ground ginger 
 1 tsp  Cayenne  powder 
 2 cup Fresh or frozen  okra 
 1 med-size  Eggplant , peeled and cubed 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Across much of Africa, soups and stews made with  peanuts  usually called groundnuts are staple main-meal foods. Depending on the hotness of your chilies or your  Cayenne , this version may be uncomfortably spicy. Unless you relish very hot foods, begin with no more than half the  pepper  specified here.
 Boil  Chicken  with  ginger  and the  Onion  half, using about 2 cups  water .
 Meanwhile, in a separate large pot, fry  tomato  paste in the  oil  over low heat for about five minutes. Add to the paste the chopped  onions  and  tomatoes , stirring occasionally until the  onions  are clear. Remove the partially cooked  Chicken  pieces and put them, along with about half the broth, in the large pot. Add the  Peanut   butter ,  salt  and  peppers . Cook for five minutes before stirring in the  Eggplant  and  okra . Continue cooking until  Chicken  and vegetables are tender. Add more broth as needed to maintain a thick, stewy consistency.
 To make this a vegetarian dish, substitute 2 vegetable bouillon cubes for the  Chicken . Or make fewer pieces of  Chicken  go farther by removing meat from the bone.
 Like many West African foods, this stew is rather peppery. If mild foods are more your style, reduce the amount of  peppers  or  Cayenne . Serve over  rice .
