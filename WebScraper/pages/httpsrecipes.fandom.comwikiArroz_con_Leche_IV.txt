 Ingredients : 
 1 small can of  sweetened condensed milk 
 1 cup of uncooked  rice 
 ½ cup of  water 
 2 sticks of  cinnamon  cracked 
 1 cup of  evaporated milk 
 6 cup of  milk 
 ½ cup of  raisins 
 1 teaspoon fresh  nutmeg 
 ½ teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 First, in a large cooking pot, add the  water , 4 cups of  milk , uncooked  rice ,  cinnamon ,  evaporated milk ,  vanilla  and  nutmeg . 
 Once on the stove, bring the liquid to a boil. 
 Boil for about 5 minutes. Then, add the sweetened  condensed milk . 
 Add a little  water  to the  milk  can and empty its contents into the pot, by this time the liquid should be simmering, on low heat. 
 The  milk  should just barely simmer, with bubbles breaking only the outside edge of the surface. 
 As the liquid begins to reduce, add the remaining  milk  in small increments as you continue to stir. 
 As you add the  milk  stir the mixture so that it cooks evenly. 
 Continue to stir intermittently, until the liquid has become a gooy paste. 
 Then add  raisins  and cook for an additional 10 minutes on. Total cooking time 1:15 minutes. 
 Serve chilled or room temperature.
