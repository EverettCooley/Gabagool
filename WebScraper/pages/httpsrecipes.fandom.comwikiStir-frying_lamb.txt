Stir-frying is an ideal quick method of cooking meat as the thin strips cook in only a few minutes. It is only necessary to use a very small amount of oil when stir-frying. Use vegetable based oil which can be heated to higher temperatures. Use a non-stick wok or large frying pan. Always ensure that the pan or wok is really hot before adding the meat a little at a time - it should sizzle when the pieces are added. The meat should ideally be trimmed of excess fat and cut into approximately 1cm and half strips, cut across the grain to help tenderize the meat and prevent shrinkage. In stir-frying is recommended to use fresh vegetables like green beans, broccoli, mange tout carrots, peppers, and spring onions Chinese leaf, Swiss chard curettes, and sugar snap peas or try a packet of stir-fry vegetables from the supermarket. Add the meat and stir-fry for the recommended time.
