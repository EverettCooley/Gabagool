About Bread machine yeast : 
 This type of dry yeast is highly active and very finely granulated so that it hydrates quickly. Breads made with this yeast require only a single rise, so this yeast is handy to use in a bread machine. Most machines will have you add this yeast last, on top of the dry ingredients. If you're not using a bread machine, add this yeast to the flour and other dry ingredients. It's often sold in 4-ounce jars. 
 Equivalents : One package active dry yeast = 2¼ teaspoons bread machine yeast 
 Substitutes : 
 
 Active dry yeast  – One envelope active dry yeast = 2¼ teaspoons bread machine yeast. Ordinary active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water first, and the bread will need to rise more than once 
 Compressed yeast  – Substitute one cake for each package or 2¼ teaspoons of dry yeast. This needs to be dissolved in water first, and the bread will need to rise more than once 
 Instant yeast  – This is very similar. One envelope active dry yeast = 2¼ teaspoons bread machine yeast 
 Storage : 
 You can store unopened jars at room temperature until the expiration date stamped on the jar, but the yeast lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer. If you freeze yeast, let it come to room temperature before using.
