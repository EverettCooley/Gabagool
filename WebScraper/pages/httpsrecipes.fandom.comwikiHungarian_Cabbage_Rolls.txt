 Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds  ground pork 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 1 teaspoon  paprika 
 2 tablespoons  lard 
 ½ cup  onions , finely chopped 
 ½ cup  rice 
 1 head  cabbage 
 1 can  tomato soup  (or ¼ cup  ketchup ) 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  onion  in  lard  until soft, then add  paprika . 
 Then combine the ground  pork ,  salt ,  pepper  and  rice . 
 Then pour the  onion  mixture over this and mix very well. 
 Remove the core from the  cabbage  and steam until the leaves just wilt. 
 Separate the leaves and remove the back rib from the  cabbage  with a knife. 
 Then wrap meat mixture in  cabbage  and place in a pot. 
 Pour tomato soup (I prefer the  ketchup ) over the rolls and add enough  water  to cover and some to spare. 
 Boil for 45 to 60 minutes. 
 Enjoy.
