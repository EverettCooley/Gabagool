 Ingredients : 
 Dough : 
 2½ cups  flour 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 cup hot  water 
 1 tbsp  shortening  or  oil 
 Filling : 
 1 lb  ground pork 
 2 tbsp  soy sauce 
 1 tbsp  sesame oil 
 1 tsp grated  ginger 
 pinch of  sugar 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 3  green onions , chopped 
 1  egg 
 1 tbsp  cornstarch 
 1 can  water chestnuts , finely chopped 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 Dipping Sauce : 
 ½ cup  soy sauce 
 ¼ cup  white vinegar 
 1 tsp chile oil 
 1  green onion , chopped 
 Directions : 
 Combine the  flour ,  salt , hot  water  and  shortening  in a bowl and incorporate into a smooth dough. 
 Allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes, covered. 
 Combine the filling ingredients. 
 Combine the dipping sauce ingredients. 
 Roll the dough out about ⅛ thick. 
 Use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out 3 inch circles. 
 Brush a little  water  over the circles and place about 2 teaspoons of filling in center. 
 Fold the circles in half and press to seal, making sure to squeeze out any air. 
 Stand the dumplings up on the folded side and press slightly so that they stand up nicely. 
 To cook, bring a pot of salted  water  to boil, and boil the dumplings until cooked through, about 5 minutes. 
 Drain well. 
 The dumplings may be frozen at this point for future use; this recipe makes about 8 dozen. 
 Heat a skillet with about 2 tablespoons  oil  and fry the dumplings on one side only, until nicely browned. 
 Drain on paper towels. 
 Serve with the dipping sauce.
