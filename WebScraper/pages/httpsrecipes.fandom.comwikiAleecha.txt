 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup  Onion , sliced 
 10 clv  garlic , sliced thin 
 2 cup  carrots , sliced thin 
 1 cup  water 
 3 tbl  corn oil 
 1 tsp  turmeric , ground 
 1 fresh hot  green peppers , halved, to 3  peppers 
 1 lb  cabbage , coarsely sliced 
 1 tsp queman, see note 
 1 tbl  tomato  paste 
 1 tsp  salt , to taste 
 1 lb  potatoes , cut like French 
 Directions : 
 Aleecha is a mixed vegetable stew. Quemam contains an ingredient not found in the US. I'd substitute dry  berbere  spice mix. In dry pan over moderate low heat, stir fry  Onion ,  garlic , and  carrots  for 2 mins. Add 1/2 cup of the  water  and cook 5 mins longer. Add the  oil  and continue to simmer. 
 Add the  turmeric , chilies, and  cabbage . Cover the pan and steam to reduce the bulk for 2 mins. Stir well and add the quemam,  tomato  paste,  salt  and the  potatoes . 
 Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins. Add the remaining  water  and simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the  potatoes  and thicken the sauce somewhat. Serve at room temperature with Injeera.
