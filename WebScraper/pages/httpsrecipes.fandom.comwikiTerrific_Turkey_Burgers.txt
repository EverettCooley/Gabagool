Terrific Turkey Burgers
 Looking to lighten up your burgers? Try these easy-on-the-calories, 
protein-packed turkey sensations, topped with a tangy sauce of light 
mayonnaise, garlic and green onions. The recipe is part of our July 
Quick & Healthy Five-Day Plan.
 
 1 bunch green onions, coarsely chopped, green and white parts 
 
 separated 
 
 1 garlic clove  

3 tablespoons light mayonnaise  

1/2 cup packed fresh parsley leaves  

1 pound lean ground turkey  

3/4 teaspoon salt  

1/2 teaspoon black pepper  

16 spinach leaves, cleaned  

4 whole wheat sandwich buns, split  

1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers or pimientos, rinsed, patted dry 
 
 and sliced 
 Directions
1. In a food processor, pulse the greens of the onions and the garlic 
to finely chop. Scrape into a bowl; stir in the mayonnaise. Set 
aside. 
 2. Process the white of the onions and the parsley to finely chop. 
Add the turkey, salt and pepper. Process just to blend. Shape the 
turkey mixture into 4 patties. 
 3. In a large nonstick skillet, cook the burgers over medium-high 
heat, turning once, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. 
 4. Place the spinach on the buns. Top with burgers, peppers and onion 
mayonnaise.

 Village Tip
Do not overprocess the turkey mixture or the burgers will be too 
dense. If you'd like to grill the burgers, brush both sides with 
olive oil before placing on the grill.
