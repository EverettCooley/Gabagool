 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 lbs Small  Squid , cleaned, bodies sliced into ¼-inch rings tentacles halved if large 
 1 cup Plain dried  bread  crumbs (about 4 ounces) 
 1 tsp  oregano , crumbled 
 1 tsp Freshly ground  pepper 
 salt 
 1/2 cup  olive oil 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 1 large clove  garlic , minced 
 1 tsp Anchovy paste 
 1/2 lbs Dried  capellini  (or other thin  Pasta ) 
 1 tbsp  unsalted butter 
 lemon  wedges, for serving 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 450 °F. 
Bring a large saucepan of  water  to a boil. 
In a large bowl, toss the  Squid  with the breadcrumbs,  oregano ,  pepper , and one teaspoon  salt . 
Spread the  Squid  in a large baking dish in a single layer and sprinkle with any leftover crumbs. 
Drizzle ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons of the  olive oil  on top. 
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the  Squid  is golden brown and crunchy. 
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, whisk the  garlic  and the anchovy paste into the remaining ¼ cup  oil  and bring to a simmer over low heat. 
Cook, whisking, until fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes; add  salt  to the boiling  water . 
Add the  capellini  and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 3 minutes. 
Drain the  Pasta  and return it to the saucepan. 
Add the anchovy sauce and the  butter  and toss to coat; make a bed of  capellini  on a platter or plates. 
Mound the baked  Squid  on the  Pasta  and serve with  lemon  wedges.
