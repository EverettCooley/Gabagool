 About Mace : 
 This spice tastes and smells like a pungent version of  Nutmeg , and for a very good reason ... mace is the bright red membrane that covers the nutmeg seed. After the membrane is removed and dried it becomes a yellow-orange color. It's sold ground and, less frequently, whole (in which case it's called a blade). Mace is used to flavor all manners of foods, sweet to savory.
