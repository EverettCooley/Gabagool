Description : 
 A TNT recipe contributed by  Catsrecipes Y-Group 
 
 Source: With Love from Darling's Kitchen 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  butter , softened (1 stick) 
 2 cups grated  Swiss cheese  (8 oz) 
 2 to 3 tbsp finely chopped  chives 
 1 pkg.  cream cheese , softened (8 oz) 
 ½ tbsp  sweet basil  flakes 
 ¼ tbsp  oregano  flakes 
 ⅛ tbsp  garlic powder 
 2 sprinkle  cayenne pepper  (just a pinch) 
 ¼ cup  pine nuts  (optional, but recommended) 
 Directions : 
 Beat  butter  until creamy. 
 Beat in  Swiss cheese  and chopped  chives  and beat until thoroughly blended. 
 Set aside. 
 In another bowl, beat  cream cheese  until creamy. 
 Beat in the remaining ingredients until blended. 
 Line a 2 cups mold (without a hole in the center) with plastic wrap. 
 Now layer evenly half the  Swiss cheese  mixture and half the  cream cheese  mixture, using a piece of plastic wrap to help you press the mixture into the designs of the mold. 
 Repeat layers. 
 Cover top with plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
 To unmold, remove plastic cover, invert onto a serving platter and carefully peel off plastic lining. 
 Sound like a whole production, but lining the mold with plastic wrap, makes unmolding incredibly simple. 
 Decorate top with fresh minced  chives  and surround with  lemon  slices. 
 Serve with gland soda crackers, or thin slices of crusty  Italian bread . 
 Serves 8 as an appetizer. 
 Notes : 
 Gorgonzola  may be substitute for the  Swiss cheese . Can be prepared 2 or 3 days earlier and stored in the refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Can be served at the end of the meal with fresh fruit....just lovely.
