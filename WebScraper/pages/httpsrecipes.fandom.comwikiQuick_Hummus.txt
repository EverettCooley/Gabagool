Description : 
 Garbanzo bean dip
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can of  garbanzo (ceci) beans 
 1 medium-sized clove of  garlic  (or Â½ of a big clove) 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 3 tablespoons sesame seed paste ( tahina ) 
 3 tablespoons of  lemon juice 
 a pinch of  cayenne (red) pepper 
 Directions : 
 Strain the  garbanzo beans , reserving the liquid. 
 Put the  garbanzo beans  and all of the other ingredients in a blender. 
 Blend on high for about 20 seconds. 
 Turn off the blender and stir the mixture with a spoon. 
 Add from the reserved liquid, 1 spoon at a time, just enough to get the mixture to run smoothly in the blender (you will not need to add all of the liquid) 
 Run the blender for about 20 seconds after each addition of liquid. The final product should be thick, not runny. 
 Spoon into a bowl or plate. Drizzle with more  olive oil  if desired. 
 Serve with grilled meats or spread in sandwiches. 
 For a light dinner, serve along-side a plate of finely chopped tossed salad. 
 Eat with pita or other soft flat bread, using the bread to grab the hummus dip and salad (without the use of spoon or fork).
