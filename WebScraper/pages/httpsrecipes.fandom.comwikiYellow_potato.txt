About yellow potatoes : 
 Yellow potatoes have skins and flesh that would range from pale yellow to golden yellow. Their flesh has a buttery flavor and they are used for baking, boiling, roasting, and mashing. Some yellow potato varieties are the  Bintje , Charlotte,  Yellow Finn , and  Yukon Gold . It is a type of potato that will typically not develop a brown tone when cut as quickly as some varieties.
 When selecting, then choose those that are only firm and plump, avoiding those that have the shriveled skins, sprouting eyes, soft spots, blemishes, and green spots. Store potatoes in a cool, dry place. They will keep at room temperature for up to two weeks and longer when stored in cool temperatures. Do not store in the refrigerator because the cold temperatures will convert the starches into sugar and the potato will become sweet and turn a dark color whenever cooked. Do not store with onions; the gas given off by onions will accelerate the decay of potatoes.
