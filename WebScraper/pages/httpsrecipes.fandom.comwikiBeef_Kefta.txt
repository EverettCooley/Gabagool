 Ingredients : 
 1 1/2 pounds ground  Beef 
 1/2 cup grated  Onion 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh  parsley 
 1 teaspoon dried  mint , crumbled 
 salt 
 black pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 1/2 teaspoon Spanish  paprika 
 1/4 teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  Beef ,  Onion ,  garlic ,  parsley , coriander,  mint ,  salt ,  pepper ,  cumin ,  paprika  and  Cayenne  in a large bowl, making sure the mixture is even. 
 Cover the bowl and let it sit for one hour whilst soaking 12 wooden skewers in  water . 
 Preheat the grill so it is hot when needed. 
 Shape about a 1/3 cup of the meat mixture into 2 sausages and put onto a soaked wooden skewer. Dampen your hands first so the meat does not stick to them. Do this until the mixture is used up. 
 Grill them on one side until golden brown and turn over. Leave them for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. 
 Serve immediately whilst piping hot.
