      Bratwurst     
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup fresh white  bread crumbs 
 ½ cup  milk 
 2½ lbs lean  veal , preferably  shoulder 
 2½ lbs  pork belly  or fatty  pork butt 
 1 tbsp + 2 tsp  salt 
 1 tsp freshly ground  white pepper 
 1½ tsp freshly ground  nutmeg 
 8 yards prepared  casings , about 4 oz. 
 2 tbsp melted salted  butter 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl, soak the bread crumbs in the  milk . 
 Grind the  veal  and  pork  belly together, first coarsely and then finely. Place the meat into a large bowl. Add the  salt ,  nutmeg ,  white pepper  and softened bread crumbs. Mix well with your hands until thoroughly blended. 
 Working with about one-quarter of  sausage  filling at a time (cover the rest and refrigerate the remainder). Stuff the casings loosely with the  sausage  filling. Pinch and twist into 4 inch links. Refrigerate the first ones while doing the rest. 
 To cook, prick the sausages all over to prevent the skins from bursting. Place as many sausages in a skillet as will fit in a single layer without crowding. Pour in about one-half inch of  water , cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Pour off any liquid. Add  butter  to the pan and cook uncovered, turning, until the sausages are evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
