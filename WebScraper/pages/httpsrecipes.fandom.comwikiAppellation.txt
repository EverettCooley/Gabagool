A grape growing region. Each appellation has its own regulations for wine making. For example, Appellation dâ€™Origine Controlle (AOC) are a series of laws which were developed in France in the early twentieth century. These laws regulate specifics such as the regional boundaries, grape varieties that are allowed to be grown in the region, and labeling rules. If a wine is labeled with an Appellation, the wine must be in compliance with the regulations of that region. All wine countries of the world have their own AOC laws. Wine produced in a specific region is known to have the specific characteristics of that appellation.
