      Cultivated mushrooms     
 Mushroom grown from pasteurized spawn, often commercially. Cultivated mushrooms are common mushrooms with smooth, white circular caps. They are also called white mushrooms. Select firm, plump mushrooms that are not slimy or bruised. Store mushrooms unwashed-lightly wrapped in paper towels or in a paper bag, never in plastic-in the refrigerator.
