INGREDIENTS : 
 cooking spray 
 2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
 1-1/2 cups granulated sugar 
 3-1/2 tsps baking powder 
 1 tsps salt 
 1-1/4 cups RumChata liqueur 
 vegetable oil 
 8 tbsps butter, softened 
 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract 
 3 large eggs, room temperature 
 confectioners' sugar 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a 12-cup Bundt cake pan by spraying with cooking spray. 
 In the bowl of your stand mixer or other large mixing bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. 
 Measure the 1-1/4 cups of RumChata in a clear, glass, 2-cup capacity measuring cup, then add enough vegetable oil to bring the liquid up to 1-1/3 cups. (Make sure this measurement is accurate as they are very close to each other.) 
 Add the RumChata mixture, butter and vanilla to the flour mixture and beat on medium-high for two minutes. Add the eggs and beat another two minutes. (It is imperative not to overmix, otherwise your cake will be tough.) Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan. Bake cake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 
 Cool on wire racks for 2 hours. Remove from pan and cool completely. 
 Dust with confectioners' sugar when completely cool.
