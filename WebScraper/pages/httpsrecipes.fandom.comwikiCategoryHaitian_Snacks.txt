 You will notice that Haitians are not familiar with junk food and their snacks are mostly considered light salads that can be eaten between meals, such as noni salad, papaya jam or green papaya salad. Other snacks that can be found in the restaurants situated on the coast are the fish and chicken croquettes and sweet Haitians vanilla bean marshmallows. The fries are also common, but not made of potatoes; the Haitians fries include white fish fries and the famous breadfruit fries. Bananas, under any fresh or cooked form are great snacks, especially because they are various, light and accessible anywhere. Of course, commercial snacks are also available, such as crackers, roasted seeds, peanuts and all other types of snacks you would expect to find in a US store, for example.
