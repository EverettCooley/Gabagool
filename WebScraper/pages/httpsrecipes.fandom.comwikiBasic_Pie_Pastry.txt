 Ingredients : 
 1 2/3 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 2 Tbs.  Sugar 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 1/2 cup (1 stick) very cold  unsalted butter , cut into 1/4-inch pieces 
 4 1/2 Tbs. ice-cold  water 
 Directions : 
 To make dough in food processor: In work bowl, combine  flour ,  Sugar  and  salt  and pulse to mix. Remove lid and scatter  butter  over  flour  mixture; replace lid. Pulse machine repeatedly in 4-second bursts until  butter  is broken into fine bits. Remove lid and add 3 tablespoons  ice   water . Replace lid and pulse several times until mixture is evenly dampened. Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons  water ; pulse again until dough starts to form large crumbs that can be easily packed together.
 
 To make dough by hand: In medium bowl, mix together  flour ,  Sugar  and  salt . With pastry blender or two knives, cut in  butter  until mixture resembles small  Peas . Add  ice   water  about 1 1/2 tablespoons at a time, mixing, fluffing and compressing dough with fork until it adheres. (You may need to add slightly more  water  than stated when making dough by hand.)
 
 Empty crumbs onto work surface and pack together like a snowball. Gently knead 2 or 3 times to distribute fat. Place dough on large sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 3/4-inch-thick disk; smooth cracked edges. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 45 to 60 minutes before rolling out.
