      Eton Mess     
 Prep Time:  20 minutes
 Cook time:  1 hour (plus overnight to dry out the meringues)
 Serves:  6
 
 Description : 
 Strawberries and cream with meringue for long summer dreaming days.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 oz / 175 g  caster sugar 
 3 large  egg whites 
 1 lb / 450 g fresh  strawberries , hulled 
 1 tbsp  icing sugar 
 1 pint / 570 ml  double cream 
 Directions : 
       Strawberries     
 Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time until thoroughly whisked in. Take rounded dessertspoonfuls of the mixture and place in rows on a lined baking tray. Place in the oven at 275 °F/140 °C for an hour. After that, turn the oven off and leave the meringues in the oven to dry out overnight, or until the oven is completely cold. 
 When you're ready to go, chop half the strawberries and place in a blender with the icing sugar. Whiz to a purée and pass through a sieve to remove the seeds. Chop up the rest of the strawberries and whip up the cream to the floppy stage. 
 Break up the meringues, place in a bowl with the chopped strawberries and fold in the cream and the purée.
