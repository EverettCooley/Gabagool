 Every region which is a part of the country of Bhutan has its own specialty, as a result of different influences. Although meat is considered very delicious and consistent in the Bhutani cuisine, the slaughter of animals is forbidden here and this is because Bhutan is a Buddhist country. In any case, this does not represent a problem, as people can replace meat with any kind of vegetarian dish consisting of cheese and chilli. Chilli seems to be an essential or, more exactly, a vital element in Bhutani cuisine and this is due to the fact that the Bhutani people seem to depend on this ingredient. Yak meat is another delicious meal, together with pork fing, beef and mushrooms, spicy pork with potatoes, minced chicken, beef and mushroom tshoem, and rice or cheese dishes.
