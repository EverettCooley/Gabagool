 Ingredients : 
 3 tbsp  mango chutney 
 16  pitted dried plums (prunes) 
 1 tsp  dry mustard 
 8  bacon strips, each cut in half crosswise 
 pinch  of cayenne pepper, plus more for garnish 
 4 slices  of firm white sandwich bread 
 salt and freshly ground pepper 
 butter for spreading   
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Mix the chutney, mustard, and cayenne, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
 Make a small slit in each dried plum and stuff with a little of the chutney mixture. Wrap each with a bacon strip and secure with a toothpick. Place the wrapped dried plums on an oiled baking sheet.
 Bake for 10–12 minutes, turning them after 5 minutes, until the bacon is crisp.
 Meanwhile, toast the bread. Remove the crusts, and using a 2in (5cm) cookie cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Butter the toast rounds and top each one with a bacon-wrapped plum. Sprinkle each with a little cayenne pepper and serve warm.
