Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup  popcorn  unpopped, or 16 cups premade 
 1/4 cup  oil 
 1/4 cup  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 2 cups dark melting chocolate wafers 
 1/2 cup  red hots  cinnamon candies 
 3/4 cup thin  pretzel  sticks broken in half 
 1 package candy eyes 
 Instructions : 
 Pour the oil and corn kernels in a large pot over med-high heat (make sure you use one that has a tight fitting lid). Place the lid on top of the pot and mix it around a few times directly on burner. 
 In a small bowl mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Then add sugar directly on top of the corn kernels. 
 Replace lid and shake the pot in circular motion on the burner, until you hear the kernels start to pop. 
 Continue to shake in a circular motion while the kernels are popping until they are all completely popped, when there's about 2-3 seconds between pops. 
 Remove from heat and pour out onto 2 ft. x 2 ft. piece of wax paper and let it cool. 
 Melt dark chocolate in the microwave, I started with 1 minute then stir and heat for another 30-45. Stir again until completely melted, no chunks.  
 Drizzle over popcorn, then top with red hots and pretzels; then mix together using two large spoons and slightly turning the popcorn, pretzels and red hots over one another, until all of the mix is mostly covered. 
 Once chocolate has cooled and hardened, add in eyeballs and serve.
