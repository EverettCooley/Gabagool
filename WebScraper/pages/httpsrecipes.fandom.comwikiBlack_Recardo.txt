 2 tablespoons  achiote  seeds 
 ¾ cup  bitter orange juice  (or a mixture of sweet  orange juice  and fresh  lime juice ) 
 2 lbs. dried  ancho chiles , seeded and deveined 
 2 large whole  cloves 
 4 large whole  allspice 
 1 tablespoon  black peppercorns 
 1 tablespoon dried  oregano 
 ½ teaspoon  cumin  seeds 
 1 head  garlic , peeled (about 10 large cloves)

 Directions : 
 Place the achiote seeds in a small bowl, pour the juice over them, and allow to soak 2 – 3 hours. 
 Toast the chiles just until they give off their fragrance, soak them in hot water until they soften, and drain them well. 
 Place all ingredients in a spice mill or food processor and process until they are well blended. 
 They should form a thick paste, the consistency of a chilled cookie dough.
