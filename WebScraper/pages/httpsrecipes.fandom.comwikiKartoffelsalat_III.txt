 1 large  white onion  chopped 
 ½ cup  cider vinegar 
 ½ cup  water 
 4 tablespoons  olive oil 
 4 slices  bacon  cooked and crumbled 
 3 tablespoons  parsley  chopped

 While hot remove skins and set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle comfortably. 
 Slice into a large bowl. 
 Simmer onion in a saucepan with vinegar and water until tender. 
 Pour over potatoes and allow to stand until cold. 
 Do not mix or disturb the potatoes as they will crumble and become mushy. 
 When potatoes are cool add oil, bacon, parsley, salt and pepper then toss gently to blend flavors.
