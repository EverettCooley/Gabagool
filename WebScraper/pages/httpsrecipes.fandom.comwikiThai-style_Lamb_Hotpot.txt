      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 This is an alternative-style  Lamb  casserole dish that tastes really nice.
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 chicken stock  (or "bouillon" paste) 
 3 tablespoons of your favourite Thai  curry paste 
 10  Lamb chops  - fat trimmed off 
 1 large  leek 
 3 medium  potatoes 
 A few  shallots 
 4 mild long  red chillies 
 1 large  carrot 
 Some chopped fresh  coriander leaf 
 Directions : 
 The  Lamb  chops should be your favourite cut - but should be trimmed of most of the fat - in order to keep this meal as low-fat as possible.
 
       Lamb chops     
           
 Chop the  coriander leaf  - chopping the stalks finely - but the leaves coarsely. Also slice the mild red chillies into half-size strips. For the  chicken stock  - I used a  Chicken  "bouillon" paste - which when diluted in 400ml of boiling  water  makes a really nice  Chicken  "stock" soup base for the casserole. And the Thai  curry  paste I used for this dish is "Sharwoods" Thai red  Chicken   curry  paste - but you can use whatever you like - but just make sure that there are no artificial ingredients - especially make sure that there is NO  monosodium glutamate  ( MSG ) - as this will spoil the dish. (And will also make you feel incredibly thirsty afterwards too.)
 
           
           
 Chop the  carrot  into similar sized strips - and slice the  leeks  as well as the  potatoes  - doing the latter thinly as they will be used to cover the top of the casserole dish. Also coarsely chop the shallots. Don't worry if you can't get hold of shallots - use  Onion  instead.
 Brown the  Lamb  chops in a little  oil  in a large frying pan - turning over once or twice on medium heat.
 
         Chop shallots and chillie. Slice leek, carot and potato     
         Brown lamb chops     
 Then add the Thai  curry  paste to the frying pan - stirring and turning the chops as you go . Also toss in the sliced red chillies.
 
         Add the Thay paste     
         Add the chope red cillie     
 Meantime - make up the  chicken stock  - about 400ml. And then lay the browned  Lamb  chops in the bottom of the casserole dish - and then pour on the chopped veg and also the chopped stalks of the coriander. Pour over the  chicken stock .
 
         Make up the chicken stock     
         Add the leek, carot and coriander leaf     
 Then layer on the slices of  Potato  so that it covers all of the mixture. Crack some  black pepper  on top and put the lid on - and stick the dish in a preheated oven at 130 celcius. Cook like this for 1.25 hours.
 
 
         Layer the potatoe slices on top     
         Pool lid on and stick in oven     
 Then take the lid off and cook for another 45 mins - so that the  potatoes  go brown and crispy a bit on top.
 
         Take lid off and cook further     
         Should look like this     
 Then garnish with the remaining  coriander leaf  and serve up into a couple of bowls. Then eat!
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
