 Ingredients : 
 x soy sauce 
 x  garlic powder 
 x  powdered ginger 
 x  sesame oil 
 x hot  oil 
 Directions : 
 I tend to cook without recipes and with a real eye to quickness. In other words, i"m lazy. Thought i"d share a couple ideas i"ve come up with recently (obviously i never measure anythingâ€”sorry). To a partly-full bottle of soy sauce, i add some  garlic powder  and some  powdered ginger  and a little  sesame oil  and hot  oil . I keep this around (haven"t needed to refrigerate it), shake it up and sprinkle a bit over steamed vegetables (my favorite is  green cabbage , sliced finely). A little goes a long way so i think the fat from the oils is negligible. The flavor they add is significant
