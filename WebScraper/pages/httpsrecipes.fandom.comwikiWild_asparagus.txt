 About Wild asparagus : 
 This plant is a native asparagus species and is endemic  to Western Europe. Recent evidence indicates that wild asparagus is a separate species to garden  asparagus  ( Asparagus officinalis spp. officinalis ) and not a subspecies as previously thought. The stems grow prostrately and have needle-like leaves, which reach 16 (exceptionally 24) mm long. The flowers are small and green, and produce bright red berries.
