 Serves 4 to 6 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup (125 ml) shelled  pumpkin seeds  (pepitas) 
 1 cup (250 ml) chopped  cilantro  (coriander leaves) 
 1 cup (250 ml) chopped  scallions  (spring onions) 
 1 cup (250 ml) chopped canned or fresh  tomatillos 
 1  jalapeño  or other hot green chile, seeded and chopped, or to taste 
 about ½ cup (125 ml)  chicken stock  or  water 
 3 tbs (45 ml)  vegetable oil 
 2 – 3 lbs (900 – 1350 g)  chicken  parts 
 salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Toast the pumpkin seeds in a dry skillet over moderate heat until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. 
 Combine in a blender with the cilantro, scallions, tomatillos, jalapeño, and enough chicken stock to make a smooth, thin paste. 
 Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet, preferably non-stick, over moderate heat. 
 Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brown on all sides in the hot oil. 
 Add the green sauce and enough additional chicken stock to make a thin, soupy sauce. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer uncovered until the chicken is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
