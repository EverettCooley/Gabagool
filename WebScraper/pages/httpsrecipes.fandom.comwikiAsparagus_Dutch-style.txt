 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â½ to 2 pounds  asparagus , trimmed 
 6 tablespoons  butter , or more 
 4  eggs 
 salt  and  pepper 
 8 thin slices dry-cured  ham , like  prosciutto 
 12 or 16 paper-thin slices  Parmigiano-Reggiano 
 Directions : 
 Poach or steam asparagus in or above boiling salted water until it is bright green and just tender, 3 to 7 minutes, depending on its thickness. 
 Meanwhile, put 4 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat. 
 Place at least 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, and turn heat to medium. 
 When butter in skillet melts, crack eggs into it. 
 Cook, sprinkling with salt and pepper, until whites are no longer runny, about 5 minutes. 
 Drain asparagus and divide among 4 plates. 
 Turn off heat under butter in saucepan the moment it browns; if eggs are not quite ready, keep butter warm over low flame. 
 Top asparagus with a portion of ham, then a fried egg, then some browned butter, and finally a few slices of the cheese. 
 Serve.
