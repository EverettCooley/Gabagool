 Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. 
 Ingredients : 
 3  zucchini , scrubbed 
 2 cups  parsley  sprigs 
 1 to 2  garlic  cloves, or to taste 
 ⅔ cup  walnuts 
 3 tablespoons freshly grated  Parmesan 
 Directions : 
 Using a mandolin or similar slicing device cut the  zucchini  lengthwise into ⅛-inch slices. 
 Arrange the slices on a steamer rack set over simmering  water  and steam them, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are just tender. (The  zucchini  slices should be barely flexible enough to roll. They will soften more as they cool.) 
 In a food processor purée the  parsley , the  garlic , the  walnuts , 2 tablespoons of the  Parmesan , and  salt  to taste until the mixture is smooth. 
 Arrange the  zucchini  slices on a work surface and dot each slice along its length with a heaping teaspoon of the purée. 
 Roll up each slice jelly-roll fashion and fasten the spirals with wooden picks. 
 Arrange the spirals in a shallow baking dish. 
 Sprinkle them with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan, and bake them in the upper third of a preheated 425 °F oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the spirals are heated through.
