 Season the fish with the  garlic ,  olive oil ,  salt  and laurel. 
 In a large saucepan place the  Onion  sliced in rings, the  garlic , the laurel, the  pepper , the  tomatoes  chopped up, the  sage  and the  olive oil . 
 Fry this for a short while then add the  potatoes , the  cassava , the  yam  and the  pumpkin  cut into cubes. Allow it to stew for a while, adding sufficient  water  for this purpose. 
 When nearly all the ingredients are cooked, add the fish. 
 When the fish is cooked the broth is ready. 
 If the broth is too watery then, separate from the saucepan, you can dilute a spoon of  flour  with a small quantity of the broth, and add this to the saucepan with a wooden spoon, to ensure that it does not stick to the spoon.
