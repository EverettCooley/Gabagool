 About Celery seed : 
 The seed from a wild form of celery, which is used as a spice. It has a strong celery flavor, so a little goes a long way. It is a popular flavoring for soups, salads, pickles, and sauces.  Celery salt  can be substituted, but only if absolutely necessary, because it is basically just flavored  salt  and may add too much sodium to a recipe.
