 Ingredients : 
 1 pint  heavy cream 
 2 tbsp  buttermilk 
 Directions : 
 Put cream in glass container or jar and add  buttermilk . 
 Stir lightly and cover. 
 Allow jar to stand at room temperature until thickened to the consistency of  sour cream . 
 This can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, depending on the temperature of the room. 
 The warmer the room, the faster it will turn to crème fraîche. 
 Crème fraîche will continue to thicken as it chills. 
 It will keep for about 10 days in the refrigerator.
