 Description : 
 Tunisian-Style Greens and beans
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 1 medium  Onion , sliced 
 2 or 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 teaspoon ground coriander 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1/4 teaspoon crushed  chile  flakes 
 4 cup chopped greens, such as  beet greens  or  Swiss chard 
 1 cup diced  tomatoes  with juices 
 1 cup cooked beans (garbanzos are my favorite) 
 approx. 1/2 cup bean cooking  water 
 
 Directions : 
 Stew the  Onion  and  garlic  in a little  oil  until the  Onion  is soft. 
 Stir in the  salt  and spices. 
 Chop the greens and stir them in. (A little  water  left on the greens from washing them is good, it helps steam them done.) 
 When the greens wilt, add the  tomatoes , beans and some of the bean cooking  water . Cook for 10 or 15 minutes. The finished dish should be a little saucy, but not soupy. Add bean  water  or plain  water  accordingly.
