 Description : 
 This vegetarian salad is made with real vegetables and enriched with real cheese to white-hot perfection. This is as great a dish as it can get when it comes to vegetables.
 
 Ingredients: : 
 1 ½ pound fresh  asparagus , trimmed and cut into thirds 
 2 medium yellow  bell peppers , seeded and diced 
 ¼ cup  olive oil 
 1 large  red onion , cut into strips 
 ¼ cup toasted  almond  slices 
 ½ cup grated  Parmesan  cheese 
 ½ cup olive oil 
 3 tablespoons  Dijon mustard 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 teaspoons  lime juice 
 2 teaspoons  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  hot sauce 
 salad seasoning mix, to taste 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 400° F. 
 Arrange the asparagus spears and bell peppers in a single layer on the baking sheet, and drizzle or mist with ¼ cup of olive oil. 
 Roast 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Remove from heat, and cool completely. 
 In a bowl, toss together the asparagus, bell peppers, onion, almond slices, and Parmesan cheese. 
 In a separate bowl, mix the ½ cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, lime juice, sugar, hot sauce, and salad seasoning. 
 Pour dressing over the salad and toss to coat.
