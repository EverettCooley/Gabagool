Description : 
 This is called asag and it is used in makaronah felforn bilbashamel ( pasta  casserole).
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  onion  chopped 
 1 lb very lean  ground beef 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 1½ cups  water 
 salt  and  pepper 
 ½ cup chopped  nuts  ( almonds  or  walnuts ) optional 
 1 stick of  butter  (melted) 
 1  egg 
 ½ cup  milk 
 1 package frozen  filo dough  sheets (thawed) 
 Directions : 
 Sauté the  onion  in the  oil  until it changes color to dark yellow. 
 Add the meat and brown it then add the  water ,  salt  and  pepper  and let it cook until all the  water  has evaporated. 
 If you decide to use  nuts  add them at this time. 
 Open the  filo dough  package and divide the sheets in half (they are usually sheets of 10x20" rectangles, you want to end up with 2 stacks of 10x10 sheets. 
 In a greased 9x12x3" baking dish layer 2 to 3 sheets at a time and sprinkle them with a few drops of the melted  butter , and so on until you finish the first half of the sheets. 
 Spread the meat and nut mixture on it and start doing the same thing with the other half of the sheets. 
 Don't worry about spreading the  butter  on the sheets. 
 When you finish with all the dough cut the feteer in 2x1" squares with a sharp knife. 
 Mix together the left-over melted  butter , the  egg  and the  milk  and a pinch of  salt  (not much) beat it with fork. 
 At this point, if you want, you can wrap the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ½ hr before it is time to eat. 
 Pour the  egg  mixture gently over the feteer and bake, uncovered, in a 375°F oven for about 20 minutes or until the  milk  is absorbed and the feteer turns gold yellow.
