Description : 
 This is a recipe I obtained from an Estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Konder Estate in Dallas, Texas in 1991.

 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  dry yeast 
 ½ teaspoon  sugar 
 2⅔ cups warm  water 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 7½ cups unbleached  all purpose flour 
 ¼ cup  whole wheat flour 
 1 tablespoon  coarse salt 
 Directions : 
 Proof the yeast for 10 minutes in 1 cup of warm water and a pinch of sugar until yeast dissolves and liquid begins to appear creamy. 
 Add remaining water and 2 cups flour including the whole wheat flour. 
 Beat this well until it's smooth and soupy then let it stand for 15 minutes until it is bubbly and swollen. 
 Add salt and olive oil and proceed to stir in the rest of the flour by the cupful until the dough is stiff but still slightly sticky. 
 When dough begins to form a cohesive mass thick enough to hold its shape then turn out onto a lightly floured surface and let it rest. 
 Meanwhile clean and oil the bowl. 
 Knead dough turning it clockwise by quarter turns and sprinkling a little flour on top and on the surface underneath before folding it over. 
 Add just enough flour so the dough doesn't stick and tear. 
 When dough is smooth return it to the oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. 
 Let it rise until doubled then it is ready for use.
