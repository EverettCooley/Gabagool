Description : 
 Chili recipes abound! There are recipes for super-hot "5-alarm" chili, white chili, vegetarian chili â€” if you can imagine it, there's probably a recipe for it. What sets the following chili recipe apart from the others is that it's loaded with flavor (so the adults will like it) without all the "heat" (so the kids can eat it.)
 This makes a lot of chili. Fortunately, it freezes well. I recommend freezing the leftovers in meal-sized portions. If you defrost in the microwave, defrost in 5 minute increments using medium power (50%), stirring each time you add another 5 minutes. Total defrosting time varies, depending on such factors as individual microwave oven wattages and amount of chili being defrosted.
