 6 ounces  semisweet chocolate  morsels 
 2 ounces  white chocolate , chopped 
 Â¼ cup  heavy cream 
 4 ounces  bittersweet chocolate , finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon  unsalted butter , softened 
 cocoa , for dusting 
 ground toasted  nuts  ( hazelnuts ,  walnuts  or  pecans ), for dusting 
 Directions :

 In a double boiler (or a metal bowl over simmering  water ), melt remaining  semisweet chocolate  without stirring.

 In a separate metal bowl, melt  white chocolate  using the same method. 
 Spread  semisweet chocolate  on cookie sheet, creating a 6" x 9" rectangle.

 Place cookie sheet in refrigerator and chill 1 hour. 
 When  chocolate  is hard, trim edges with a knife and cut into six 3" squares. 
 Place 1 square on a piece of parchment paper and create a box by standing 4 pieces around it (reserve remaining piece for lid). 
 Dip a small metal spatula in very hot  water , wipe off excess  water , and using the hot spatula, heat outside seams of box so  chocolate  melts slightly and edges adhere to each other (if at any time  chocolate  gets too soft, put it back in refrigerator until firm again) keep chilled until ready to use. 
 In a small saucepan, bring  cream  to a boil. 
 Remove from heat and add  chocolate , stirring gently until smooth. 
 Add  butter  and pour into a small plastic bowl.

 Using a melon baller, scoop  chocolate  into 12 to 20 balls. 
 Roll half the balls in  cocoa  and the other half in  nuts .
