 Ingredients : 
 2 cups warm  water 
 2 tsp  baking powder 
 4 cups  all-purpose flour 
 one-half cup  Sugar 
 one-quarter tsp spice (one or more of the following to total one-quarter teaspoon:  cardamom ,  cinnamon ,  allspice ,  ginger ) 
 2 tbs  butter ,  margarine , or  vegetable oil 
 one-quarter cup warm  milk  (optional) 
 1  egg , lightly beaten (optional) 
 pinch of  salt 
 oil  for deep frying 
 Directions : 
 All pastry ingredients should be allowed to come to room temperature if they have been in the refrigerator. 
 In a mixing bowl combine the  flour ,  baking powder ,  Sugar , and spice. 
 Add the  yeast . 
 Mix the  water ,  butter  (or  margarine , or  oil ),  milk , and  egg  together. 
 Gradually add this mixture to the  flour  while kneading into dough. 
 Head until a smooth and elastic dough is formedâ€”fifteen to twenty minutes. 
 If using  yeast : Place dough in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to rise in a warm place for an hour or more. 
 If using  baking powder , let dough rest for several minutes. 
 Divide the dough into several hand-sized pieces. 
 Roll or press the pieces into circles about one-half inch thick. 
 Cut circles into halves or quarters. 
 Heat a few cups of  vegetable oil  to 300 degrees Farenheit in a skillet or deep pot. 
 Fry the doughs in the hot  oil , turning a few times, until they are golden brown all over. 
 Fry only as many together as can float in the  oil  without touching one another. 
 Place on paper towels to drain. 
 Serve warm.
