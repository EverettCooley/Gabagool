INSTRUCTIONS
 
Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of your oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.
 
 While the oven is warming up, you can begin to prepare the sauce and toppings.
 
 In a medium sauté pan, heat about a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low and sauté the onions, garlic, bell pepper, and okra until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside until you're ready to top the pizza.
 
 Place the same pan back on medium-low heat, and add the tomato sauce, paste, and wine. Stir to combine and reduce until pizza sauce consistency, about 5 minutes. Add the cayenne pepper, thyme, and about a half a tsp of salt and pepper. Set aside.
 
 Dust a counter with the 2 tablespoons flour. Roll the dough into a 13- to 15-inch diameter round and transfer to your hot pizza stone that was preheating in the oven.
 
 Top the pizza first with the sauce, leaving about an inch around the edges.
 
 Add half of the cheese, then the sautéed vegetables and meats, then the rest of the cheese.
 
 Bake for 15 minutes, until crust is crispy and cheese is melted.
 
 Let the pizza cool for 5 minutes before slicing!
