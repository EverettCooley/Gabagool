 Sausages are an important part of the meat dishes in the Spanish cuisine. Embutidos, chorizo and morcilla are the most famous Spanish sausages, and each has a specific taste. The chorizo is the spiciest of them all, and is made of pork, seasoned with chili and paprika. Cocido, another meat based dish, combines different kind of meats, from pork to lamb and chicken, all into a thick stew served with chickpeas. Lechazo asado (a dish based on roasted lamb meat) and Chuletillas, also made from lamb chops, are other typically meat-based Spanish dishes. There are also some thick soups made from a large variety of meats, so you can surly have a choice for every taste.
