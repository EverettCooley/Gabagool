 Ingredients : 
 2 fresh  Beef  (or other species) marrow bones, each at least 1 in long 
 water 
 1  beer 
 
 Directions : 
 In about a 2 qt pan, put the bones, and add enough  water  to cover the bones. Bring  water  to a boil; continue to boil for at least 10 minutes. (More time is ok, for a richer broth.) 
 
 Remove bones, and return any  Beef  marrow to the liquid, along with any meat that you can get off the bones. Cool the broth to room temperature. Pour liquid only into 2-4  ice  cube trays. Chop up the marrow/meat/gristle into little bits, and put them into each section of the tray. Freeze solid. Serve 2-3 cubes to your beardie on a very hot day. (Not too many if you made the broth very rich with extra bones or lots of marrow.)
