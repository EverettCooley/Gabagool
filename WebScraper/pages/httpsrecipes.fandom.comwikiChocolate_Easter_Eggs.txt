 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  butter , softened 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 1 (8 oz) package  cream cheese , softened 
 2½ lbs  confectioners' sugar 
 1 cup creamy  peanut butter  (optional) 
 1 cup flaked  coconut  (optional) 
 1 cup unsweetened  cocoa powder  (optional) 
 2 cups  semisweet chocolate  pieces 
 2 tbsp  shortening   or   vegetable oil  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, mix together the butter, vanilla, and cream cheese. 
 Stir in confectioners' sugar to make a workable dough. 
 For best results, use your hands for mixing. 
 Divide the dough into four parts. 
 Leave one of the parts plain. 
 To the second part, mix in peanut butter. 
 Mix coconut into the third part, and cocoa powder into the last part. 
 Roll each type of dough into egg shapes, and place on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet. 
 Refrigerate until hard, at least an hr. 
 Melt chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water. 
 Stir occasionally until smooth. 
 If the chocolate seems too thick for coating, stir in some of the shortening or oil until it thins. 
 Dip the chilled candy eggs in chocolate, and return to the waxed paper lined sheet to set. 
 Refrigerate for ½ hr to harden.
