 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs.  shrimp  (peeled and de-veined) 
 1½ dozen  limes 
 1 medium  onion  (chopped) 
 1  red bell pepper  (chopped finely) 
 2 – 3  jalapeno  or  habanero peppers  (chopped finely) 
 6 – 8 tbsp.  parsley  and/or  cilantro  (chopped) 
 YiiiEiiii Chombo sauce (or a purchased Habanero  pepper sauce ) 
 Directions : 
 Squeeze  limes  and pour juice into a glass bowl or pan (no metal!!) 
 Chop  shrimp  into about 4 – 5 pieces depending on what size you bought 
 Add  shrimp ,  onions , red pepper, jalapenos, and  parsley  and/or  cilantro  to bowl. 
 Let this mixture sit on kitchen counter for up to 2 hours. Then refrigerate. This is done when the  shrimp  are pink and opaque. 
 Before serving, taste for hotness. If not hot enough for you, add a few drops of  pepper  Sauce. 
 Serve with Saltine Crackers. 
 Notes : 
 Corvina Seviche is made the same way. Amount would be 6 – 8 fillets, skinned and cut into small pieces. You can substitute the type of (corvina...keep wishing): it should be a firm white , such as red  snapper . 
 The amount of  limes  is going to depend on how juicy they are. You want the juice to cover the  shrimp . Also, for the faint-hearted that don't want this hot—cut  peppers  into long strips. Keep tasting the  lime juice  as the  shrimp  marinate. When it tastes hot enough for you, take out the  pepper  strips.
