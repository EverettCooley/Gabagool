 First, it is essential that you buy the freshest possible green chilies.

 Heat  water  to a rolling boil, along with one teaspoon of  salt . 
 Now, add the clean green chilies to the hot  water , stir and let stay for one minute. 
 Remove the green chilies and drain on a paper towel. 
 Discard the  water . 
 Mix the ingredients of set 2 and grind in a blender until smooth. 
 The consistency should be that of very thick  yogurt . 
 It should not be of dripping consistency! this is the stuffing. 
 Make a slit, lengthwise, along three fourth of the  chile 's length. 
 Remove any seeds and then stuff the stuffing in the  chile . 
 Repeat this for the remaining chilies. 
 Mix well the  flour  from set 1,  baking soda ,  salt ,  yogurt  and a little  water . 
 The consistency is that of thick, beaten  yogurt . 
 This is the batter. 
 Heat  oil  in a skillet, dip the chilies in the batter and drop gently in the  oil . 
 Deep fry the chilies, occasionally turning, until they are golden yellow in color. 
 Repeat for all the chilies. 
 Serve warm. 
 Alternate serving option: make a slit along the bajji lengthwise, like you have made before, and stuff with finely chopped  onions  mixed with  lime juice  and  salt .
