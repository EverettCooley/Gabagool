 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ teaspoon dried  rosemary 
 ¼ teaspoon dried  basil 
 ½ teaspoon dried  thyme 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 4  lamb chops  (¾ inch thick) 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 ¼ cup minced  shallots 
 ⅓ cup aged  balsamic vinegar 
 ¾ cup  chicken broth 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl or cup, mix together the  rosemary ,  basil ,  thyme ,  salt  and  pepper . 
 Rub this mixture onto the  lamb  chops on both sides. 
 Place them on a plate, cover and set aside for 15 minutes to absorb the flavors. 
 Heat  olive oil  in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
 Place  lamb  chops in the skillet, and cook for about 3½ minutes per side for medium rare, or continue to cook to your desired doneness. 
 Remove from the skillet, and keep warm on a serving platter. 
 Add  shallots  to the skillet, and cook for a few minutes, just until browned. 
 Stir in  vinegar , scraping any bits of  lamb  from the bottom of the skillet, then stir in the  chicken broth . 
 Continue to cook and stir over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until the sauce has reduced by half. 
 If you don't, the sauce will be runny and not good. 
 Remove from heat, and stir in the  butter . 
 Pour over the  lamb  chops, and serve.
