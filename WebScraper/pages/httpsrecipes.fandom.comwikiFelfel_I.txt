Description : 
 Algerian pepper confit
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 – 12 miniature  sweet peppers 
 ¼ cup of  pine nuts 
 1½ cup or more of  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons of  white vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Make an incision in the  peppers  and stuff with whole  pine nuts . I used about 8 – 10 in each  pepper . You can substitute coarsely chopped  almonds  or  walnuts . 
 Cook the  peppers  over very low heat in the  olive oil , turning frequently. 
 They will start to blister and take a light golden color. 
 Very carefully transfer them to a clean glass jar and cover with the cooking  oil . 
 If there is not enough  olive oil  to cover the  peppers  add more  oil . 
 Add about 2 tablespoons of  white vinegar . 
 Seal the jar and let rest at room temperature for at least a day before eating. 
 Sprinkle fresh chopped herbs such as flat leaf  parsley  or  coriander leaf  on top and wedges of  lemon  for service if desired.
