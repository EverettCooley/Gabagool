From my grandmother's collection. The date has faded out, but the recipe card is well worn and has lots of stains on it so I am guessing it is very old. It has to be at least 60 years old because she died in 1938 (unfortunately I never knew her, but my aunts and great aunts tell me she was a fabulous cook). She had 13 children, so she was used to cooking.
