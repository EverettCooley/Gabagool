Ingredients : 
 1 kg of  semolina  flour (2.2 lbs) 
 3  eggs  separated 
 750 gm of  sugar  (1.6 lbs) 
 2 sticks of  butter  softened 
 1 tablespoon of  vanilla extract 
 If you add a teaspoon of  baking soda  the cookies will be lighter. 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  egg  yolks and  butter  until light and fluffy as shown. Add the  Sugar  and blend. 
 Whisk the  egg  whites until the consistency shown. This is the way I was taught to make the cookies. I don't really know if it makes much of a difference to the finished product. 
 Add the  vanilla . Blend the  egg  and  butter  mixture with the  flour . The dough will feel "gritty". 
 Add the  egg  whites. If the dough does not come together add a little  water  and blend until it does. Do not overwork the cookie dough. 
 Take a  walnut  sized piece of dough and shape it with your hands to form a sphere. Wetting your hands with  water  keeps the dough from sticking to your hands. It takes a little practice to form dozens of even ones. If you like you can dip the cookies in  confectioner's sugar  before baking. Place the cookies 2" apart from each other on a buttered or parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for about 10 â€“ 15 minutes. My home oven is awful, poorly calibrated and it burns
