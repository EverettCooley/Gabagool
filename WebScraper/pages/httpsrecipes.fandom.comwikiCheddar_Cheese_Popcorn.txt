 INGREDIENTS : 
 1/2 cup uncooked popcorn kernels (around 15 cups popped popcorn) 
 1/2 stick butter, melted 
 1/2 cup cheddar cheese sprinkle 
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Cook your popcorn kernels your preferred way. If using a silicone popcorn bowl, cook kernels in the microwave with the lid on for about 3 minutes on high, or until popping slows to 8 seconds between pops. 
 While popcorn is cooling, melt butter in the microwave (around 45 seconds to 1 minute) and let cool slightly. 
 Pour popcorn into a mixing bowl. Drizzle half the butter over popcorn, then sprinkle with half the cheddar cheese sprinkle. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon. Repeat with the remaining butter and cheddar sprinkle, and season with salt, to taste. Enjoy!
