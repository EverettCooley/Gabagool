 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 6 sheets of  fillo  (or  puff pastry , pancakes, or bread) 
 6-8 tablespoons of  butter , melted 
 2/3 cup black or  golden raisins 
 1 cup mixed whole or slivered  blanched almonds , chopped  hazelnuts  and chopped pistachios 
 5 cups whole  milk 
 1 ¼ cups  heavy cream 
 ½ - 2/3 cup  Sugar 
 1-2 teaspoons  cinnamon  (optional) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Keep the sheets of  fillo  in a pile, covered with a damp towel to keep them from drying out. 
 Brush each one with melted  butter  and place them on top of each other on a buttered baking sheet. 
 But the buttered  fillo  sheets in a preheated 350F oven for about 10 minutes, until they are crisp and the top ones are slightly colored. 
 When cool enough to handle, crush the pastry with your hands into pieces into a baking dish, sprinkling the  nuts  and  Raisins  between the layers. 
 Bring the  milk  and  cream  to a boil in a pan with the  Sugar  and pour over the pastry. 
 Sprinkle, if you like, with the  cinnamon  and return to the oven. 
 Raise the heat to 425F and bake for about 20–30 minutes, until slightly golden. 
 Serve hot.
