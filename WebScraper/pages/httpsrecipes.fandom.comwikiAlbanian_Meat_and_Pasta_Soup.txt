 Place the boned meat into a saucepan of boiling water and bring back to the boil. Cook for 2 hours so that the meat is tender and starting to come away from the bone. (If mince is being used skip this step) 
 Once the meat is ready, remove from the heat and remove all the meat from the bone placing it back into the water and disgarding the bone. You will need about 2 litres of boiling water - disgarde some if you have to much. 
 In a frying pan fry the onion for a couple of minutes. If you are using mince meat then add the meat and continue to fry until the mince is browned. 
 Add the carrots, puree and 100ml of boiling water. Leave to simmer for 10 minutes. 
 Add the mixture into the water and meat saucepan, bring back to the boil and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, parsley and the dried vegetable stock. 
 Add the soup pasta and leave to simmer for a further 30 minutes. 
 Leave the soup to cool slightly, serving warm.
