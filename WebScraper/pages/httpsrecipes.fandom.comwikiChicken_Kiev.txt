      Chicken Kiev     A boned  chicken breast  rolled around a chilled chunk of herbed butter, with the edges fastened so the butter won't escape during cooking. The breast is dipped in  egg  and then  bread crumbs  and fried until crisp. When pierced with a fork or cut into, the chicken emits a jet of the fragrant melted butter. The dish is named after the Ukrainian city of Kiev.
