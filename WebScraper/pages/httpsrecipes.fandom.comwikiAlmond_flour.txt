 About Almond flour : 
 Almond flour is very finely ground almonds. The taste of most baked goods made with almond flour is quite similar to those made with wheat flour. One precaution, cookies and other goodies made with almond flour tend to brown more quickly than those made with other flours. When using almond flour, adjust the oven temperature down about twenty degrees to compensate for this.
