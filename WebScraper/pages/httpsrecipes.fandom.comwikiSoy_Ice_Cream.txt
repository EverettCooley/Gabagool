 2 cups  soy milk 
 ⅓ cup  maple syrup  or  brown rice syrup  (or a combination) 
 2 tsp  vanilla

 Blend in any desired flavoring ingredients (see below). 
 Pour into your ice cream machine, and prepare following the manufacturer's instructions. 
 For various flavors : 
 For  banana soy ice cream , blend in 2 ripe bananas 
 For  strawberry soy ice cream , blend in 12-16 frozen and partially thawed strawberries. 
 For  ginger soy ice cream , add either ¼ cup preserved ginger or 1 to 2 inches grated fresh ginger (for preserved ginger, add to food processor so it gets ground up). 
 Use your imagination to come up with new flavors!
 Flavored liqueurs or syrups are a great way to add punch. Try crème de menthe and chocolate chips, or coffee liqueur, or instant coffee powder...
 This would be especially great as a vegan brownie sunday using our brownie mix, or a vegan ice cream sandwich using one of our cookie mixes, or serve with our rich chocolate cake.
