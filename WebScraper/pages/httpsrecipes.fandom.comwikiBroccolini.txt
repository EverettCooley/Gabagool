 About Broccolini : 
 Broccolini is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is a green vegetable that resembles broccoli. Even though it is often mistaken for broccoli, broccolini is in fact o hybrid of the cabbage family Brassica oleracea, a cross between broccoli and Chinese Kale. This plant has a sweeter flavor than broccoli and it can be prepared in many ways, from sauteeing, boiling, or steaming to stir frying. Broccolini contains a rich amount of calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, and folate. It also has a sweet and delicate flavor with a subtle peppery edge, and its flavour becomes sweeter and milder when it is cooked. This plant has a long, slender steam, reminiscent of asparagus, being topped with a small flowering bud which is similar to a cross between broccoli and an asparagus tip. The long and slender steams and flowering buds can be cooked in many different ways, such as marinated, grilled, microwaved, steamed, or blanched. Broccolini can be cooked with rye bread, mustard-flavored mayonnaise, red onions and cheddar cheese.
