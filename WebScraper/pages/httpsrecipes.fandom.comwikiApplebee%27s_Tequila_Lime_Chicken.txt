My favorite line from a movie & so trueÂ :-) The American President
 They don't have a choice! Rob
Rumson's the only one doing the
talking. People want leadership.
And in the absence of genuine
leadership, they will listen to
anyone who steps up to the
microphone. They want leadership,
Mr. President. They're so thirsty
for it, they'll crawl through the
desert toward a mirage, and when
they discover there's no water,
they'll drink the sand.
 SHEPHERD
 
   (evenly)
 
 Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
sentence with two hands and a
flashlight. People don't drink the
sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
They drink it 'cause they don't know
the difference.
