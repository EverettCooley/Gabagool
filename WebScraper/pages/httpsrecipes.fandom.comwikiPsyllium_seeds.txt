 About Psyllium seeds : 
 Psyllium is mainly used as a dietary fiber, which is not absorbed by the small intestine. Psyllium ( P. ovata ) has small seeds; 1,000 seeds weigh less than 2 grams. Under ideal conditions of adequate moisture and low temperature 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), 30% of seeds germinate in 5 to 8 days. The seed shows some innate dormancy (3 months) following harvest.
