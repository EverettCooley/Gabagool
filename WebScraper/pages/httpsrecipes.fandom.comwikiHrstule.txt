Description : 
       Hrstule     
 Makes 1 batch 
 Ingredients : 
 6  eggs 
 ¼ cup  sugar 
 2 tsp  butter 
 1½ l cooking  oil 
 1 tsp  lemon peel  bits 
 1 tbsp  rum 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 2 lbs  flour ; blended with... 
 3 tsp  baking powder 
 Directions : 
 Separate  eggs ; beat whites until they "peak". 
 To slightly beaten  eggs , add  sugar  and cooled, melted  butter ; blend until smooth. 
 Add the  egg  whites,  lemon peel ,  rum  and  vanilla  and blend. 
 Add enough  flour  (about 2 pounds) to make a dough that will roll nicely. 
 Roll out the dough to ⅛ inch thickness. 
 Cut into ⅝ x 6 inch strips. 
 Over quite hot fire, heat the  oil  until it stops hissing or "speaking". 
 Use a pan to give you an  oil  depth of about 2 to 2½ inches. 
 This will allow your hrstule to submerge when you drop it in, and when it rises to the surface, it pretty well indicates readiness to turn. 
 Turn and cook both sides a golden brown color. 
 Coat with  powdered sugar  while hot. 
 Twist in various shapes or knot your hrstule before dropping into  oil .
