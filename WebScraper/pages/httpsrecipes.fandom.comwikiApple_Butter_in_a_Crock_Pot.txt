Directions : 
 Contributed by  World Recipes Y-Group 
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 cups  apples  (cooked and mashed) 
 5 cups  sugar 
 2 tbsp  vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Boil applesauce on high heat, then add sugar and vinegar. 
 I hold the cinnamon until last Â½ hour because I think it evaporates some. 
 Cook on high heat (about 4 hours) until the apple butter is as thick as you want it when you cool and serve.
