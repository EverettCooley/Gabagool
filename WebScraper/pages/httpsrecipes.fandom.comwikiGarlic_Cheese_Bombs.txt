 Description : 
 This white-hot, savory biscuit-based appetizer is made with real cheese and herbs and delivers a bold aroma that it relishes. Make baked, stuffed biscuits tastier by drizzling with melted butter or cheese sauce.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can of pre-made biscuits (10 pieces) 
 20 cubes of cheese (Cheddar, Colby, Mozzarella, Camembert, or Swiss) (½" x ¾" x ¾") 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 1 clove garlic, crushed 
 ⅓ cup cheese (Cheddar, Roquefort, Parmesan, Emmental, or Asiago) 
 2 teaspoons dried parsley 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 375° C. 
 Cut each biscuit in half and slightly roll out. Place a cheese cube in the middle and wrap the biscuit dough around the cube, ensuring the edges are sealed. Roll with your hands to make a ball shape. 
 Place butter and garlic in a small bowl and melt in the microwave about 12 seconds. In a separate bowl, combine parsley and cheese. 
 Dip each rolled biscuit into the butter mixture and then into the cheese mixture. Place on a parchment-lined pan. 
 Bake 10-12 minutes or just until browned. Serve hot and plain.
