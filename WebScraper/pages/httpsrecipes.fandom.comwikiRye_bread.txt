 Wikipedia Article  About Rye bread on Wikipedia 
 Rye bread is bread made with rye flour. It can be light or dark in color, and is typically denser than bread made from wheat flour. It is higher in fibre than other types of common bread and is darker in color and stronger in flavor.
 
Rye is made into both loaf breads and crisp bread. There are three different types of rye crisp bread: normal yeast fermented, sourdough fermented, cold/crisp bread. Most of the crisp bread produced in Scandinavia is produced following 3-4 hours of fermentation. Sourdough versions are used in Finland and Germany. The third type of crisp bread is the so-called cold bread crisp bread, which is baked without the addition of yeast. The dough gets the right texture from a foaming process, where air is incorporated into the cooled dough, which also leads to the almost white colour of the finished bread. Crisp bread has a long shelf life due to its very low water content (5-7%).       Rye bread
