 About Vegetable marrow : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Vegetable marrow on Wikipedia 
 Cultivated in England, this green, oval summer squash can grow to the size of a watermelon. It's closely related to the Zucchini and can be cooked in any manner suitable for that vegetable. Because of its bland flavor, vegetable marrow (also called marrow squash) is often stuffed with a meat mixture. It's available in limited supplies in some specialty produce markets during the summer months.
