 About Grape juice : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Grape juice on Wikipedia 
 Grape juice (sometimes abbreviated GJ) is a fruit juice obtained from crushing grapes. The juice is often fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. In the wine industry grape juice is often referred to as "must." Grape juice can also be sweetened and preserved as a non-alcoholic beverage. Preserving grape juice requires pasteurization because the unprocessed juice will naturally ferment from yeast on the grapes.
