Description 
 The  Zombie  is an exceptionally strong cocktail made of fruit juices and rum, so named for its perceived effects on the drinker. It first appeared in the late 1930s, invented by Donn Beach (formerly Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gannt) of Hollywood's Don the Beachcomber restaurant. He concocted it one afternoon in the late 1930s for a friend who had dropped by his restaurant before flying to San Francisco. The friend left after having consumed three of them. He returned several days later to say that he had been turned into a zombie for his entire trip. Its smooth, fruity taste works to conceal its extremely high alcohol content. For many years the Don the Beachcomber restaurants limited their customers to 2 zombies apiece.
 There are countless variations on the Zombie; every bar, chain restaurant, and individual seems to have their own take on it. The following is only one of many possible zombies but is not as potent as the original recipe.
