 Ingredients : 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 teaspoons  turmeric 
 1 teaspoon  ground coriander 
 ½ teaspoon  cumin 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 1 tablespoon  fish sauce 
 1 pinch  salt 
 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 1¼ lbs lean  beef  or  chicken  or  lamb  or  pork , sliced thinly into strips 
 Directions : 
 Soak a package of small bamboo skewers in  water  for 2–3 hours. 
 Prepare all ingredients and have at hand. 
 Combine the seasoning ingredients in a medium size bowl and mix well. 
 Mix the meat with the seasoning and marinate at room temperature for one hour or refrigerate overnight. 
 Preheat a grill or broiler. 
 Thread the marinated meat onto the skewers. 
 Cook the satays over a hot fire or broil them in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until done. 
 Do not leave them un attended! 
 Serve immediately on a garnished plate. 
 The best flavor is from grilling, but you can broil skewers in the oven too. 
 Use a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil and cake rack to keep the skewers off the foil, otherwise they will simmer in their own juices, becoming tough and dry.
