Description : 
 Hunkar Begendi  - Roasted  eggplant  purée
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 small  eggplant  (about ½ lb. or 2 medium (about 1 lb. ea.) 
 1 tbsp  butter 
 1 tbsp  flour 
 ⅓ cup  milk 
 ¼ cup kasher /  kasseri , freshly grated or use  romano  cheese 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 black  pepper , freshly grated 
 Directions : 
 First, roast the  eggplants  in the following fashion: prick each one in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a long handled fork. 
 Then impale them, one at a time, on the tines of the fork and turn them over a gas flame until the skin chars and begins to crack (if you have an electric stove, pierce the  eggplants , place them on a large baking sheet and broil them 4 inches from the heat cutting away any badly charred spots on the surface.) 
 Cut the  eggplants  in half lengthwise and chop them finely. 
 Then mash the pulp to a smooth puree with the back of a spoon or with a mortar and pestle. 
 In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, heat the tablespoon of  butter  over moderate heat. 
 When the foam begins to subside, stir in the  flour  and when it is completely absorbed pour in the  milk  all at once. 
 Stirring vigorously with a whisk, cook over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens heavily. 
 Beat in the pureed  eggplant , reduce the heat to low, and, stirring occasionally, simmer for 5 minutes. 
 Off the heat add the  cheese ,  salt  and a few grindings of  pepper . 
 Beat vigorously until the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost solidly in the spoon. 
 Taste for seasoning and serve at once. 
 Hunkar begendi traditionally accompanies roast or braised  veal  or  lamb .
