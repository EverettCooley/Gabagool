Salt is one of the major culprits of heart disease and a host of other diseases both deadly and common in Western societies. Why then do most "healthy eating advice" concentrate on reducing fat and so-called bad carbohydrates, when in fact reducing sodium intake and replacing it with the right minerals can have a dramatic impact on health, along with weight loss. It is virtually impossible to completely eliminate salt from your diet, but replacing table salt with the right  low sodium salt substitute  in home cooking will cut down sodium intake to the extent where significant health improvement can be detected over the long term.
 It is hardly realistic to demand that your friend cook without salt when you're invited for a dinner, or that the chef in your favorite restaurant prepare your pasta with no salt, but reclaiming control over what you can control is the first step in the path to a healthier, low sodium diet.
