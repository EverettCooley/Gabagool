Description : 
       Daikon Zosui     
 Rice stew with daikon. A yummy Japanese-style recipe. Easy to make vegan by using veggie stock.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2½ cups cooked  short-grain rice 
 ¾ cup  shiitake mushrooms , thinly sliced 
 1½ cups  daikon   radishes , sliced as directed (about a four inch long chunk) 
 ¼ cup  carrots , sliced as directed 
 ½ cup  wakame  seaweed, soaked five minutes in cold  water  to cover,then chopped into one inch long pieces (discard soaking  water ) 
 5 cups  fish stock  or  chicken stock  or  vegetable stock 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2½ tablespoons  soy sauce 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  daikon  and  carrot , and slice into two-inch-long by one-half-inch wide ribbons that are no more than one-eighth-inch thick. 
 The easiest way to accomplish this is by just using your vegetable peeler. 
 In a stockpot or large saucepan, heat the stock over medium-high heat. 
 Add the  daikon  and  carrot , and cook until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. 
 Add the cooked  rice ,  mushrooms  and  wakame , and bring to a boil again, stirring occasionally. 
 Stir in  salt  and soy sauce and serve immediately. 
 Be careful not to cook the  rice  too long; otherwise, it will end up the unappetizing consistency of glue.
