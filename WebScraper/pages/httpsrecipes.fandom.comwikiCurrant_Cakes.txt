 Old-fashioned Christmas drop cakes

 1 lbs  sugar 
 6  egg 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1  lemon ,  juice  of 
 1 lbs  butter 
 ¾ lbs  flour 
 ½ lbs  currants 
 1  lemon ,  rind  of 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  currants  with some of the  flour . 
 Work  butter  and  sugar  together to a smooth  cream , then slowly work in whole  eggs  one at a time. 
 Add a little of the  flour , rind and juice of the  lemon  and  salt . 
 Work in slowly the rest of the  flour  and the  currants . 
 Drop by spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the cakes are better when very thin. 
 A good plan is to heat the pan a bit and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them in the oven to bake. 
 Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly; otherwise, the thin cakes will be difficult to remove.
