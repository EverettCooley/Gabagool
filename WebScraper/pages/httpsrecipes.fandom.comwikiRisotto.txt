About risotto : 
 An Italian rice specialty made by stirring hot stock into a mixture of rice (and often chopped onions) that has been sautéed in butter. The stock is added ½ cup at a time and the mixture is stirred continually while it cooks until all the liquid is absorbed before more stock is added. This labor-intensive technique results in rice that is delectably creamy while the grains remain separate and firm. Risottos can be flavored variously with ingredients such as chicken, shellfish,  sausage ,  vegetables ,  cheese , white  wine , and  herbs . The famous risotto Milanese is scented with  Saffron . The use of Italian  arborio rice  is traditional in the preparation of risotto.
