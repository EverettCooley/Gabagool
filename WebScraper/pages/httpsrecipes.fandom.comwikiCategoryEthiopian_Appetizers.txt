 Appetizers in Ethiopian cuisine are often light, almost snack-like items that generally prepare one's appetite for the main course. Sometimes appetizers are selections of seasoned vegetables combined with a variety of local breads, mostly injera. A popular favorite among Ethiopian appetizers is sambusa, a delectible pastry filled with vegetables, spices, and, sometimes, various meats. However, in a simplistic sense, many Ethiopian appetizers are simply pieces of bread used for dipping in some sort of sauce or spread.
