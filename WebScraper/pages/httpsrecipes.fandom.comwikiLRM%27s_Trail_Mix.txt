Description : 
 This is my original recipe, and it could form a base for lots of variations. I usually munch through 1 serving of it a day. (Keeps me from craving chips and other things I shouldn't be eating!) I hope others will enjoy this little snack as much as I do. â€” Laura
 I got the nutritional information from the packages of the ingredients and just added them up.

 Ingredients : 
 1 tbsp raw chopped  pecans 
 1 tbsp raw chopped  walnuts 
 1 tbsp raw slivered  almonds 
 1 tbsp raw  pine nuts  (pignolas) 
 2 tbsp La Choy  chow mein noodles 
 2 tbsp Trader Joe's  oatmeal  flakes 
 Directions : 
 Just put all the ingredients in a bowl or, if you want to carry it with you, in a baggie. 
 Mix and nibble. 
 Notes : 
 Because of their shape and bulk, it's hard to measure the chow mein noodles and oatmeal flakes accurately. I think that sometimes, I use more than 2 Tbsp (I also sometimes wind up using a heaping Tbsp each of the nuts instead of a level one.) If you stay aware of that, though, you can keep track of the nutritional values and make any necessary adjustments.
 You can substitute other cereals for the oatmeal flakes and use other brands of chow mein noodles. However, the nutritional information below is based on adding up the numbers from the source packages in the recipe.
