 About English cucumber : 
 English cucumber are generally sold wrapped in plastic to reduce water loss, and so are usually not waxed and therefore do not need peeling. They are usually called seedless (which is an outright lie), but their seeds are much smaller and less prominent. It is the seeds in a cucumber (and especially in an aging cucumber) that make it bitter, so a semi-seedless English cucumber is less likely to be bitter.
English cucumber have been bred to be more easily digested than some other varieties (read: fewer burps).
