Ingredients : 
 1 1/4 cups raw  sticky rice  (sweet or  glutinous rice ). Use Thai  sticky rice  if possible. 
 3/4 cup very thick  coconut milk  for mixing with  rice  (do not shake the  coconut milk  can before opening. Spoon out only the thick part that's usually on top) 
 1/4 cup  Sugar 
 3/4 cup very thick  coconut milk  for topping the  rice  (freeze the rest of the  coconut milk  for other use later) 
 1/8 tsp  salt  for the topping 
 1/2 tbsp  salt  for mixing with  rice 
 1/4 tsp  rice flour 
 6 medium mangoesâ€”peeled and sliced 
 Directions : 
 Wash and rinse the  sticky rice  well. Add enough  water  to the  rice  so until the  water  is about 1/4" above the  rice  surface. Cook  rice  in an automatic  rice  cooker or in a bowl in a steamer. Do not open the  rice  until fully cooked (about 20-25 mins). 
 Heat, on low, 3/4 cup of  coconut milk  in a small saucepan. Add  Sugar  and 1/2 tbsp  salt  to the  coconut milk  and cook until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour into cooked  rice . Stir to mix well and set aside to let stand for about 15 mins. 
 Heat the rest of  coconut milk  and add  salt . 
 Stir until the  salt  is dissolved. 
 This makes the topping sauce. 
 To serve, place sliced mangoes on a side of a serving disk. Spoon some seasoned  sticky rice  on the other side. Top the  rice  with 1 or 2 tsp of  coconut  sauce and serve. 
 Makes about 6 servings.
