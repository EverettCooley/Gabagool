 About Potato starch : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Potato starch on Wikipedia 
 This gluten free flour is made from cooked, dried and ground potato. It is used as a thickener in place of flour or cornstarch and can also be used in baked goods. 
 Katakuri starch, or Katakuriko (Japanese: 片栗粉) is a starch originally processed from the corm of katakuri. Despite having kuri (栗), lit. chestnut, as a part of word, it is not processed from chestnuts, but from the corm of this lily.
 Katakuriko is now often processed from potato which is available much cheaper. True katakuri is now quite costly and is rarely available in a store.
