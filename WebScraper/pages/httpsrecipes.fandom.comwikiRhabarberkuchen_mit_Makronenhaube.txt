 Description : 
 German rhubarb squares
 
 Ingredients : 
 Dough : 
 10.5 ounces (300 grams)  flour 
 4.4 ounces (125 grams)  butter 
 3.5 ounces (100 grams)  sugar 
 4  egg yolks  (use the whites in the meringue) 
 1  egg 
 1 packet  vanilla   sugar 
 Topping : 
 3.5 pounds (1.5 kg)  rhubarb  (6 – 7 large stalks) 
 10.5 ounces (300 grams)  sugar 
 3 tbsp  breadcrumbs 
 Meringue : 
 3.5 ounces (100 grams)  ground almonds 
 4.5 ounces (125 grams)  sugar 
 4  egg whites 
 Directions : 
 Sieve the  flour  into a large, flat bottomed bowl. 
 Add the  sugar  and mix well. 
 Cut the  butter  in with a pastry cutter. 
 Separate 4  eggs ; set the whites aside. 
 Add the four yolks plus one whole  egg  to the  flour  and  butter  mixture; add the  vanilla . 
 Knead briefly (it will be very dry and crumbly—that's okay). 
 Place the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to rest. 
 Wash and peel the  rhubarb , and cut it in ½ to ¾ inch pieces. 
 Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. 
 Don't grease the pan (or if you don't have parchment paper you can try it with a greased pan instead). 
 Roll the dough out to about ¼ inch thick. 
 Make a ridge around the edge to help keep in the juices (you could try to make this as a pie. This amount would probably make two small pies. The crust is thicker, denser, and sweeter than a pie crust, though). 
 Poke holes all over the crust with a fork and bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 15 – 20 minutes. 
 Mix the 10.5 ounces of  sugar  in with the  rhubarb  and let them sit together briefly to create some juice. 
 Spread the breadcrumbs over the pre-baked crust. 
 Spread the  rhubarb  evenly over the crust, along with the  sugar /juices. 
 Bake for 20 minutes at 400°F until the  rhubarb  is soft. 
 Beat the  egg  whites until they are stiff. 
 Slowly add 4.5 ounces of  sugar  and continue to beat until it's thick and creamy. 
 Fold the  ground almonds  into the  egg  whites. 
 Distribute the  egg  white mixture over the baked and still hot  rhubarb  cake and bake at 450°F for 10 minutes until the meringue is lightly browned.
