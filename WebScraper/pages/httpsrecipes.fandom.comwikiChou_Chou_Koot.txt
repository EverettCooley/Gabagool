 2 medium  chayote  squash 
 Â½ cup shredded  coconut 
 2  green chillies , crushed 
 turmeric , to taste

 mustard 
 1  red chilli 
 urad dal

 Directions : 
 Peel skin of  squash . 
 Cube. 
 Cook with a little  water ,  turmeric  and  salt . 
 When done yet firm, add  coconut  and green  chilli  mix. 
 Pour seasoning on top. 
 If there's more liquid it becomes kootu, if moist but not liquidy then poduthual. 
 Variations : 
 You can do  plantains  (raw, green or, if not there, very, very green chiquita  bananas ) for a vazhakai poduthual/thoran. 
 Also can do red  pumpkin / butternut squash  similarly. 
 An excellent and quick ckakka thoran is also possible. 
 A thai canned product is green  jackfruit , already cooked. Just shred this by hand, prepare seasoning in 5-6 tablespoons  oil  and toss crushed  coconut  and green chillies in.  salt . Stir well and remove when thoroughly heated through and still moist. 
 This dish needs a fair amount of  coconut , and the fresh one is preferred.
