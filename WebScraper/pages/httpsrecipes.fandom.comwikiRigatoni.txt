 About Rigatoni : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Rigatoni on Wikipedia 
 Rigatoni is a form of tube-shaped pasta. A large, slightly curved tube pasta that is approximately 1Â½ inches in length. It has a ridged outer surface and straight cut ends. They are used in dishes served as the main course. If not available substitute elicoidali, paccheri, penne, or macaroni. It is larger than penne and ziti. Rigatoni is usually ridged and the tube's end does not terminate at an angle, like penne's does.
 Rigatoni can be coupled with many different sauces, from creamy to chunky. Consequently, rigatoni is a popular choice for restaurants which choose to stock only one tube-shaped pasta noodle. The tube may be stuffed with cheese or other soft foods.
 The word rigatoni comes from the Italian past participle of rigare, which means "to draw a line" (American Heritage Dictionary).
