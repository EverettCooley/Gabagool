Description : 
 I always try to keep a package of whole  wheat  tortillas in my fridge and a can of  refried beans  in the pantry. If I'm really on top of things, I'll make a batch of these on Sunday (I package of 12 tortillas = 1 can of beans), freeze them, then thaw a few each night.
 
 Ingredients : 
 whole wheat  tortillas 
 refried beans 
 toppings of choice 
 salsa 
 Directions : 
 Spread the  beans  on the tortillas. 
 Add your choice of toppings or not, pop them in the toaster oven at 350°F for 15–20 minutes (they get nice and crispy) 
 Add salsa and consume.
