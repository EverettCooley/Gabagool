 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Lightly grease an 8-by-12-inch cake pan and pour in the batter. 
 Spread it evenly with the back of a spoon and then score across the top of the cake parallel lines going from the bottom left corner to the top right and vice versa, to form diamond shapes. 
 Place an  almond  in the center of each diamond. 
 Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes, when the cake should be firm and lightly browned. 
 Prepare the syrup as described below and pour it, spoonfuls at a time, over the hot cake. 
 Stop when the cake will not absorb any more and set the cake aside to cool before serving.

 Over a medium heat dissolve the  sugar  in 1½ cups  water , add the  lemon juice  and bring to the boil. 
 Reduce heat and gently boil the syrup for 10 minutes.
