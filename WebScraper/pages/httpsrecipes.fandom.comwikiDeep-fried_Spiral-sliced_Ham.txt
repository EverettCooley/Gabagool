 Ingredients : 
 7 lbs  ham , spiral-sliced and glazed 
 3 gallons  peanut oil , about, as needed to properly fill pot 
 Directions : 
 In an outdoor turkey fryer kind of contraption heat several gallons of peanut oil to 375°F. 
 You can use the oil left over from frying a Cajun turkey — it is seasoned and hot already and just perfect. 
 Lower the ham — unwrapped of course — into the hot oil. 
 Do not do anything to the ham- just remove from package. 
 As the ham fries it will 'seal' the outside with a type of crust like crispy bacon and seal all the juices inside. 
 Fry about 7 – 9 minutes — longer will give you more crust, shorter will produce less crust. 
 You may need to make this recipe a few times before you find the perfect 'doneness' for you. 
 Carefully remove from oil and let drain and cool a little. 
 Slice as you would any spiral cut ham. 
 Serve!
