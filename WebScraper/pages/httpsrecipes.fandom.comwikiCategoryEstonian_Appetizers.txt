 The appetizers are not very important in the Estonian cuisine. The consistency of the dishes is increased gradually, from the appetizers to the main dishes, but the Estonians seem to remove this course and serve directly the meat dishes. The main goal of the appetizers is to enhance the appetite. Most of the Estonian appetizers are based on fish, as this ingredient can be easily found in any part of the country. One of the representative appetizers is Keel hernestega, which is served cold. This appetizer is based on tongue. Knowing the ingredients might scare the tourists. Baked apples are also successfuly served as starters. Estonian Ham and Cheese Rolls and Fish in Tomato Marinade are other two famous Estonian dishes that can be consumed at the first course.
