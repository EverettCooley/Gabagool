 Ingredients : 
 one teaspoon salt or fish sauce 
 one pound raw shrimp 
 one teaspoon sugar 
 1 table spoon corn starch 
 1 lightly-beaten egg white 
 Â½ teaspoon sesame oil 
 one table spoon oil 
 wonton skins 
 few dashes of white pepper 
 Directions : 
 To cook, de-vein the shrimp and toss it aside. Then, using a mini food processor, beat the egg white until it becomes frothy, and add the raw shrimp, along with the other seasonings. Carefully blend these ingredients until they form a shrimp paste. Next, cut the wonton skins into very small strips and place them on a flat surface. 
 Form the shrimp paste into balls and roll them in a bed of wonton skin, but ensure that the wonton skin will evenly coat the shrimp balls. Next, deep fry the shrimp balls in a wok, until they get golden brown. Serve with hot sauce, or preferably Thai sweet chilli sauce.
