 About Otaheite gooseberry : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Otaheite gooseberry on Wikipedia 
 The Otaheite gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus), also called Malay gooseberry, Tahitian gooseberry, country gooseberry, star gooseberry, West India gooseberry or simply gooseberry tree, is the only tree with edible fruit in the Phyllanthaceae family. Despite its name, the plant does not resemble the gooseberry, except for the acidity of its fruits. It is mostly cultivated for ornamentation.
 These egg-sized fruits are borne in clusters of up to a dozen or more. Fruits are thick-skinned, fibrous, and drop from the tree while green. Before turning yellow, the flesh is crisp and somewhat acidic. It can be eaten out-of-hand, but is also prepared by stewing fruit with sugar
