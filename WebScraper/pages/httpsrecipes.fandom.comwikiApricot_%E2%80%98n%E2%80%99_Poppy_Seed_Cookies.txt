Ingredients : 
 2 cups  rolled oats 
 1½ cups  rice flour 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 1 tsp ground  cinnamon 
 ½ tsp ground  cardamom 
 ⅓ cup  vegetable oil 
 ½ cup  brown rice syrup 
 1 cup  apricot all-fruit spread 
 1 tsp  almond extract 
 ⅓ cup blanched,  slivered almonds 
 1 cup  almonds  (6 oz) 
 ½ cup  poppy seeds 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. 
 In small skillet, toast  poppy seeds  over medium-high heat, stirring often until seeds change color slightly, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside. 
 Place  almonds  on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. 
 Lightly brush two baking sheets with  oil  or line with parchment paper; set aside. 
 In food processor, finely grind toasted  almonds  and  oats . 
 Transfer mixture to large bowl. 
 Add  rice flour , toasted  poppy seeds ,  salt ,  cinnamon  and  cardamom  and mix to blend. 
 In medium bowl, mix  oil ,  rice syrup ,  apricot  spread and  almond extract  until blended. 
 Add to dry ingredients and stir just until blended (batter will be sticky). 
 Roll 1 tablespoon dough into a ball and flatten to form a cookie about 1¾ inches in diameter. (it’s helpful to dip hands and utensils in  water  when working with this sticky dough) 
 Press a cluster of blanched,  slivered almonds  (about 5) into centers of each cookie. 
 Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. 
 Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 12 minutes. 
 Allow cookies to cool in pans for several minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
