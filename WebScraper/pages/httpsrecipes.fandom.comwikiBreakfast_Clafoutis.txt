In a 10-Inch Nonstick Skillet, Melt The  butter  OverMedium Heat, Coating The Bottom And The Sides HalfwayTo The Rim. When The  butter  is Bubbling, Add The
 Fruit. Stir Until Each Piece Has Softened And IsCoated With  butter , About 2-3 Minutes. Then SprinkleIn  sugar  to Sweeten. we Use About 2 t of GranulatedSugar For All Fruit Except  cranberries  (which RequireAbout Twice as Much) And  peaches  (where we Prefer
 brown sugar ). When This  sugar  Has Dissolved And TurnedInto a Syrup—About 2 Minutes—Stir up The Batter AndScrape it Carefully Into The Pan Over The Fruit. PutThe Skillet Into The Oven to Bake For About 20
 Minutes. at This Point The Clafoutis Will be Set,Golden Brown, And Puffed up at The Edges. Divide IntoWarmed Bowls, Sift a Little Confectioners'  sugar  OverEach, And Top if You Like With a Spoonful of Sour
