 About Perry : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Perry on Wikipedia 
 Perry or pear cider is an alcoholic beverage made of fermented pear juice. It is similar to cider, in that it is made using a similar process and often has a similar alcoholic content, around 8% alcohol by volume.
 Perry has been common for centuries in Britain, particularly the West Country and Wales; and France, especially Normandy and Anjou. As with cider, special pear cultivars are used. They produce fruit that is of poor eating quality, but that produces superior perry. Perry pears are higher in tannin and acid than eating or cooking pears, and are generally smaller. Sweden also produces perry, such as Kopparbergs pear cider.
 Perry from Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England made from traditional recipes forms a European Union Protected Geographical Indication.
