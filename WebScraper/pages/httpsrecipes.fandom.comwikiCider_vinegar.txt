 About Cider vinegar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Cider vinegar on Wikipedia 
 Apple cider vinegar, sometimes known simply as cider vinegar, is made from cider or apple must, and is often sold unfiltered, with a brownish-yellow color. It is currently very popular, partly due to its alleged beneficial health and beauty properties (see below). Some countries, like Canada, prohibit the selling of vinegar over a certain percentage acidity.
 In terms of cooking, cider vinegar is not good for delicate sauces, but is excellent for use in chutneys and marinades. It can be used to pickle foods, but will darken light fruits and vegetables.
