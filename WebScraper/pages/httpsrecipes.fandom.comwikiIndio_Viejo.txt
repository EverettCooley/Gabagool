Ingredients : 
 2 pounds of red or  black beans 
 1 big  Onion 
 1 big  bell pepper 
 1 small handful of  green onions 
 1 stick of  margarine 
 2  tomatoes 
 1 1/2 cups of  butter   milk  or  sour cream 
 1 dozen  eggs 
 salt ,  pepper ,  garlic , and vinager 
 Directions : 
 Put the meat into cold  water  and begin cooking it with the  Onion , a green pepprer, half a head of  garlic , a teaspoon of  salt , and a teaspoon of  pepper   grains  until the meat is tender and well flavored. 
 Take out the meat and slice it into skinny strips. 
 While the meat is cooking, mash and mix the tortilla dough up with the  Cheese . Take 4 ounces of this dough and make a tortilla out of it (if you don't know how to make the dough than just buy tortillas at the market). 
 Mix the rest of the dough with the  paprika , 1/2 teaspoon of  pepper , mix it all up with 2 cups of the mix that the meat cooked in, and mix in two well-beaten  eggs . 
 Put the  butter  or  oil  in a pan to melt and then slice and fry an  Onion  and a  green pepper  in it until they are nice and dead. Then add in the meat and fry it all for about five minutes longer, adding in the  egg  and dough mix. 
 Let it all cook on a low fire for a while, stirring it occasionally so that it doesn't stick. 
 Add in the  allspice  and sprinkle it with  salt  and the  orange juice . It needs to be a little bit moist so add in some of the  water  from the original meat cooking if it's dry. 
 Now take the meat and dough mix and wrap it up in the tortilla and cut the whole thing into serving sizes.
