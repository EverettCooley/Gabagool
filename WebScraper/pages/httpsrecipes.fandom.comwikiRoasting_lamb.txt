About roasting lamb : 
 Roast lamb is a magnificent, savory thing. The complex flavor is bold yet delicate, the texture is a study in contrasts between the crisp, flavorful exterior and the tender, juicy interior, and the heady aroma brings a tear of joy to the eye and a bit of drool to the chin. Before roasting your lamb, remove it from the refrigerator and allow it to sit for thirty minutes or so. A piece of meat at room warmth will roast more evenly. It's always better to use a roasting rack to ensure even browning and heat circulation, so use one whenever you have got it, and buy one if you do not. The amount of fat that your piece of lamb has surrounding the outside and marbled through the middle will determine the cooking time and temperature you use. Mutton is often used, and hung before sale to intensify its taste. Around the world, are produced some of the best lamb, so even if the flocks have not munched on marjoram, then lamb is still an excellent choice for roasting.
