 About Borage : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Borage on Wikipedia 
 Borage (Borago officinalis), also known as "starflower", is an annual herb native to central and eastern Europe. It grows to a height of 60–100 cm, and is bristly-hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 5–15 cm long. The flowers are small, blue or pink, with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. It produces plenty of seeds and thus continues to grow and spread from where it is first sown or planted.
 The most commonly used part of Borage is its flowers. The blue-purple color and rather unique flavor lend themselves quite nicely to salads. The young leaves are also nice in fresh salads, but only the first few sets, as the plant gets older, the leaves get tougher, larger, more fuzzy and bitter.
