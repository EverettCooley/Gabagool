 Wikipedia Article  About Kosher salt on Wikipedia 
 Kosher salt (sodium chloride) is the most commonly used salt in commercial kitchens today. Typically, kosher salt, even unlike common table salt, contains no additives (for example, iodine). Salt is obtained through various methods, mining inland deposits left from prehistoric oceans, or by evaporating sea water. The latter is typically referred to as sea salt, and has a different flavor from mined salt.
 This salt gets its name, not from following the guidelines of kosher foods as written in the Torah, but rather because of its usage for making meats kosher by helping to extract the blood from the meat. Nearly all salt is kosher, including ordinary table salt. Kosher salt grains are larger than regular table salt grains, so when meats are coated in kosher salt, the salt does not dissolve readily. The salt remains on the surface of the meat longer, allowing fluids to leach out of the meat.
