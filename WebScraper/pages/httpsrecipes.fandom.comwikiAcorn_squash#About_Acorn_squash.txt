 Wikipedia Article  About Acorn squash on Wikipedia 
 Acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo) is a winter squash with distinctive longitudinal ridges and sweet, yellow-orange flesh. The most common variety is usually dark green in color. However, newer varieties have arisen including Golden Acorn, known for its glowing pumpkin color, and even some that are white. They can also be multi-colored. As the name suggests, its shape resembles that of an acorn. It is also very good to eat, and is said to help your stomach.
 Acorn squash can be found in stores throughout the year, but because they are harvested around late summer and early fall, they are more likely to be available from autumn through winter. To find a quality squash, search for one with a smooth, dry rind without any cracks or soft spots. The rind should be dull -- a shiny rind indicates the squash was picked too early and will not be as sweet as is usually desired. Deep color is also a sign of a good acorn squash. For example, green acorn squash may have splashes of orange, but orange on more than half its surface is a bad sign. Also, acorn squashes should feel heavy for their size.
 Before eating, scoop out the seeds and fibers. Acorn squash is most commonly baked, but also be microwaved, sauteed, and steamed. The acorn squash is not as rich in beta-carotene as other winter squashes, but is a good source of dietary fiber and potassium, as well as smaller amounts of vitamins C and B, mangnesium, and manganese.
