Description : 
 A yummy way to get vitamin A!
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 large  sweet potatoes 
 2 cups  sugar 
 1 stick  butter 
 1 pinch  cinnamon 
 1 pinch  nutmeg 
 1 store-bought pie crust or your can just line a pan with  vanilla  wafers instead 
 ½ cup  milk 
 Directions : 
 Boil the  potatoes  until tender. 
 When you stick a fork in them it should go in easy but you don't want them to fall apart. 
 Let the  potatoes  cool and then peel them. 
 Put the  potatoes  in a large mixing bowl and mash them thoroughly with a potato masher. 
 Melt the  butter  and pour it and the other ingredients in the bowl of  potatoes . 
 Stir until well mixed. 
 Whether you used a ready made pie crust or just cookies, pour the  potatoes  mixture into the crust. 
 Put into an oven preheated to 375°F. 
 Cook for about 35 – 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
