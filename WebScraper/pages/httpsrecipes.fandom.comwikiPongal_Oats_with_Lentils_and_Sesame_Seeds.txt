 Description : 
 This recipe is a  fork  of "Oats a la Pongal" from the blog  Evolving Tastes   [1] , a " fusion " dish which was inspired by  Tamil cuisine . On the day this author went to prepare the original Pongal Oats recipe I was short several ingredients and so made several substitutions and threw in a few other things I had handy.
 For those unfamiliar with Tamil and other Indian cuisine this is best thought of as something like a hearty vegetarian stew.  This recipe makes two to three servings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 one third  (⅓)  cup  rolled oats  (regular rolled oats,  NOT  quick oats or instant oats) 
 one third  (⅓)  cup  green lentils 
 one quarter  (¼)  cup  sesame seeds 
 one quarter  (¼)  cup  wheat bran 
 one and one half  (1 ½)  cups  water 
 ground  cumin 
 ground  black pepper 
 ground  fenugreek 
 ground  turmeric 
 two (2) teaspoons  ginger  paste 
 two (2) teaspoons  unsalted butter  or vegan substitute 
 one (1) tablespoon minced  onion  or  onion flakes 
 salt  to taste 
 Optional ingredients : 
 flavored canned diced  tomatoes  (see  Notes ) 
 Directions : 
 Mix the spices in a small mixing bowl 
 In a saucepan bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer 
 Add lentils and butter and cook for five minutes 
 Add the oats, sesame seed, wheat bran, spices, and all remaining ingredients and cook for five more minutes 
 Remove from heat, stir, and allow to stand for two or three minutes 
 Serve and top with diced tomatoes as desired 
 Notes : 
 Add water as needed to maintain desired consistency.
 Most spices are best if purchased as whole seeds and ground as needed, when possible. Since those used here will be softened during cooking if you do not have a grinder or mortar and pestle all that's necessary is to crush the seeds on a plate with a large spoon. (Though this approach might be difficult with fenugreek, so it's best to use a grinder or purchase it already ground.)
 The author's local grocers in the United States carry generic-brand canned diced tomatoes that are packed with onions and garlic. This serves as an excellent topping for the dish, if available.
 The wheat bran is added primarily for nutritive benefit and can be dropped though the amount of water may need to be adjusted to compensate.
