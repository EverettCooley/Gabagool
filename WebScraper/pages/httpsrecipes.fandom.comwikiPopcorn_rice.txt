 About popcorn rice : 
 Popcorn rice has a rich, nutty flavor and a popcorn-like perfume. This fragrant rice comes from Louisiana and is a basmati hybrid. Popcorn rice is accessible in white and brown organic forms. White rice sets off food savors more specifically at the same time, as brown rice has higher fiber content and takes longer to cook. This rice is the long-grain rice that has an aromatic corn or nut like fragrance and taste. The savor and perfume comes from a naturally stirring compound found in all rice as well as corn and nuts. Popcorn Rice is with ought cholesterol, sodium free, and has no more than a new, high trace of fat. A half cup portion is something like 80 calories. The rice's texture is fluffy and has a firm consistency. The grains stay separate and fluffy after cooking, so this is the best choice if you want to serve rice as a side dish, or as a bed for sauces. It can be cooked entire and served with stir-fries, sauces, and curries, or made into flour, wine, cakes, vinegar, milk, flakes, noodles, paper, and tea. Popcorn rice is the most excellent option for rice pudding and molded salads.
