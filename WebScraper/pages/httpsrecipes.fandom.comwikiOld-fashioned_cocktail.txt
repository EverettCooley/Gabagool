Old-fashioned  cocktails are said to have been made initially with a brand of Kentucky bourbon called Old 1776 in the late 1800s.  The drink is made by combining whiskey (usually Bourbon or Rye), a small amount of water, a dash of  bitters  and a sugar cube or the equivalent amount of sugar syrup. It's served over ice in a squat glass commonly called an old-fashioned glass-and garnished with an orange slice and a Maraschino cherry.
