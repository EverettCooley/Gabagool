 About Chestnut : 
 Chestnuts come from the nut-bearing Castanea tree, which is rare in the United States due to a blight in the early 20th Century. They are now cultivated in Europe and are imported fresh from September through February.
 Chestnuts, the edible fruit of a tree in the beech family, have glossy brown shells and dark fuzzy membranes that must be removed before use. Often referred to by the French "marrons," these sweet nuts are sold raw or roasted, whole or in pieces, candied or pur√©ed.
