 Wikipedia Article  About Comte on Wikipedia 
 Comté (also called Gruyère de Comté) is a French cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk in the Franche-Comté region of eastern France.
 Comté has the highest production figures of all French cheeses, making around 40,000 tonnes annually. Its name is French for 'county', and is named after the Franche-Comté region.
 The cheese are made in flat circular discs, each between 40 and 70 centimetres in diameter, and around 10 centimetres in height. Each weighs up to 50 kilograms. The fat content is around 45%.
 The rind is usually a dusty-brown colour, and the internal pâte is a pale creamy yellow. The texture is relatively hard and flexible, and the taste is mild, slightly sweet, and 'nutty'.
