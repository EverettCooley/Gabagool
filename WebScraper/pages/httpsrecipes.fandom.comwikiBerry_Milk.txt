Ingredients : 
 1 cup fresh or frozen berries, chopped 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 1 cup water 
 1 1/2-2 cups milk 
 Instructions : 
 In a small saucepan, combine the berries, sugar and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to maintain a boil and cook for 10 minutes.  
 Using a mesh strainer, strain the mixture over a bowl. Discard the berries or save for another use, if desired. Allow the syrup in the bowl to cool slightly.  
 Add about 3-4 tbsp. (or desired amount) of the syrup to two glasses. Divide the milk between the two glasses. Stir to combine. Serve!  
 Refrigerate leftover syrup. When ready to use, add desired amount to milk.
