 Ingredients : 
 For the pudding : 
 1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch 
 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar 
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
 3 cups (710 ml) whole milk 
 6 ounces (170 grams) semi- or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (or 1 cup chocolate chips) 
 1 teaspoon (5 ml) pure vanilla extract 
 For the raspberry coulis : 
 3/4 cup sugar 
 18 ounces (1 1/2 pints) raspberries 
 Directions : 
 For the pudding : 
 1. Combine the cornstarch, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan. Slowly whisk milk in a thin stream. Once the cornstarch mixture is fully incorporated, whisk quickly until smooth.
 2. Place over medium-low heat and stir occasionally, scraping the bottom and sides. Whisk often to ensure lumps don't form. 
 3. Place heat to low. After 10 minutes, the mixture should begin to thicken, enough that it will coat the back of a spoon. Add the chocolate and continue stirring for another 2 to 4 minutes. 
 4. Once the chocolate is fully incorporated and mixture is thick, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.
 
 For the raspberry coulis : 
 1. Combine sugar, berries, and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
 2. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook until sugar is dissolved, about 8 minutes. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush down any sugar crystals on the side of the pan. 
 3. Remove from heat; cool completely. Place mixture in the jar of a blender; puree until smooth. Pass through a fine-mesh colander, and discard solids.
