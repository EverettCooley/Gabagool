Description : 
 If you read this recipe and think that it is hot you might like to know that the original recipe uses 14 small  red peppers ! Add more if you like. I only taste the sauce of this, because I don't like liver, and think it is hot enough. If you cannot get the  lime  leaves the only substitute I know of is  lime  zest. The flavors do improve if you make it in advance and then reheat.
