Ingredients : 
 1/2 yeast crust recipe or 1 Boboli® crust 
 1 tablespoon oil 
 2 onions (chopped) 
 3 cloves garlic (minced) 
 1/4 teaspoon paprika 
 1 tablespoon flour 
 1/8 teaspoon pepper 
 1/3 cup sour cream 
 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 
 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves 
 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
 1/2 to 1 pound  bacon  (cooked crisp, drained on paper towels and crumbled) 
 1-1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 
 1 cup shredded mozzarella or Muenster cheese 
 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
 Steps to Make It : 
 Gather the ingredients.  
 Heat oven to 425 F. Make and prebake yeast crust if using. Prebake the crust for about 5 to 7 minutes even if you buy one from a pizza place. No need to prebake Boboli® crust. 
 Heat oil in a large skillet and saute onions and garlic until tender, about 6-7 minutes. 
 Add paprika and flour and cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add sour cream, thyme, and marjoram leaves and cook until thickened, about 1-2 minutes longer. Stir in mustard. 
 Spread this sauce over the prebaked crust and top with bacon and cheeses. 
 Bake at 425 F for 9-15 minutes until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Cut into squares or wedges and serve.
