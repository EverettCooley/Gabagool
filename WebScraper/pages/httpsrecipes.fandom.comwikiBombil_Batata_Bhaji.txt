 Ingredients : 
 8 – 10 fresh  Bombay duck  (bombil), cleaned and cut into 2 inch pieces 
 6 medium size  potatoes , preferably round in shape 
 5 – 6 tbsp finely chopped  coriander leaves 
 4 – 5 chopped  green chilies  (to taste) 
 3 tbsp  garlic  paste 
 ½ tbsp  haldi 
 3 tbsp red  chili powder 
 5 tbsp fresh  coconut  grated 
 4-5 tbsp  oil 
 salt  to taste 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Thoroughly wash the slices of  Bombay duck  in running  water . 
 Also clean the  potatoes  thoroughly (they'll be used with the skin). 
 Dry the fish and coat the slices with a mixture of  garlic  paste,  chili powder , haldi and  salt . 
 Cut the  potatoes  into thin slices. 
 Coat with haldi,  chili powder ,  salt ,  coriander leaves , green chilies and  grated coconut . 
 Put together the  potatoes  and  Bombay duck , and keep aside for 1 hour. 
 Heat  oil  in a thick bottom vessel (the traditional pan is made of brass). 
 Add the  potatoes  and fish and let the whole thing cook on low flame. 
 Initially toss the vessel (instead of stirring) to ensure that the  oil  spreads through the mixture (the pieces of fish break very easily if stirred). 
 Cover and cook till the  potatoes  are done. 
 Staunchly resist the temptation to open the lid and stir.
