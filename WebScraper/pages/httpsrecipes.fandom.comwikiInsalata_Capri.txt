 Description : 
 This is a variation on a famous salad in Italy - simple and sensational, fresh and colorful, it is tremendously pleasing.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ripe  California avocados  (one for each serving) 
 1 ball of  fresh mozzarella   Cheese  - about 8-10 ozs. (use half for each salad) 
 1 or 2 garden ripe  tomatoes , number depends on the size of  tomatoes 
 Fresh  basil  leaves 
 High quality Spanish or Italian  olive oil 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  California avocados  in half, deseed them and peel. 
 Slice  California avocado  halves into thin slices vertically and arrange on a salad by placing them in a decorative circle.
 Use only  fresh mozzarella  - it is not the same salad if you use anything generally found in grocery stores in the US. Many quality markets are now selling  fresh mozzarella .
 Slice the  mozzarella  into 1/8" circles and place overlapping on top of the  California avocados .
 Cut  tomatoes  into 1/4" thick circles and overlap on top of the  mozzarella  so the plate now has a green ring of  avocado , a white one of  Cheese  and a red one of  tomatoes . 
 Top salad with fresh  basil  leaves which are sliced into thin slivers and the amount to use can vary based on your taste for  basil . 
 Dress the salad with a splash (or more) of  olive oil 
 Add  black pepper  and  salt  to taste
