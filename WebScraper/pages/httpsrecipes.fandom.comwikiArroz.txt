 Description : 
 Serves 10. Unlike a  rice  pilaf, this good  rice  dish is moist rather than dry and fluffy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cups long  grain   white rice 
 1/4  Onion , chopped 
 1  garlic  clove, chopped 
 2 ripe  tomatoes  (1/2 lb.), peeled, seeded and chopped 
 7 cups  chicken stock 
 1/3 cup  corn oil 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Wash  rice , drain and set aside in a colander. 
 Combine chopped  Onion ,  garlic  and  tomatoes  in a food processor and process to a smooth purée. 
 Add cold  chicken stock . Strain. 
 Heat the  corn oil  in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat and sauté the  rice  until it starts to turn golden, 5–7 minutes. 
 Stir in the onion-tomato- chicken stock  mixture. 
 Bring to a simmer, cover pan and reduce heat to low. 
 Cook until almost all the liquid is absorbed and the  rice  is tender, about 25 minutes. 
 Add  salt  to taste.
