      Crispy Falafels     
 Description : 
 I made falafels as a side for dinner on Friday and we enjoyed it with raisin fried rice, grilled veggies and chicken curry. I used the left-over batter to make hot falafels for the game-night. I replaced fava beans with black eyes peas and little green gram. This is my variation of the middle eastern delight -  Falafel . They were so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spices blended well together and they tasted absolutely yummy with seasoned tahini sauce. Crispy snacks and lovely friends are the perfect accompaniment for interesting games. Coming weekend, we have Super Bowl (NFL) to watch with friends and I am sure I will make falafels again :-)
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup raw garbanzo beans /  chickpeas 
 1 cup raw  black eyed beans 
 ¼ cup raw green  gram 
 ½ cup  onions  - finely chopped 
 3 – 4  garlic  cloves - chopped 
 2 tbsp  parsley  - chopped 
 2 tbsp  coriander  leaves - chopped 
 2 tsp  coriander  powder 
 2 tsp  cumin  powder 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 – 2 tbsp  all-purpose flour 
 Salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Oil  to fry 
 Directions : 
 Clean and wash the garbanzo beans, black eyed peas and green gram. Soak the lentils overnight / 6 – 8 hours in excess water. Drain and set them aside. 
 Grind them to a coarse paste in a grinder without water. Mix in all the ingredients and let the mixture sit for 1 – 2 hours in refrigerator. Bring them down to room temperature and roll them into small balls using a falafel scoop or a spoon or a small ice cream scoop and place over a baking sheet covered with a parchment paper. 
 Heat 3 inches of oil in a deep cooking vessel (375°F) . Once the oil gets heated up, first fry 1 ball and if the balls lose shape, add little more flour for maintaining the shape. 
 Fry them in batches of 6 – 8 at a time for 2 – 3 minutes on one side or until they turn golden brown. Drain excess oil and serve with a salad / pitta bread / tahini sauce/mayonnaise.
