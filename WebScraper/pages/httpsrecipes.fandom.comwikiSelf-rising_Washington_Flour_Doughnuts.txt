 Contributed by  World Recipes Y-Group 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  butter 
 2  eggs 
 ½ tsp  nutmeg 
 1 cup  sugar 
 1 cup  milk 
 4½ cups  self-rising flour 
 Directions : 
 Cream the butter which should be soft but not melted; add sugar and blend well; add well-beaten eggs. 
 Add nutmeg to the flour and add to the first mixture alternately with the milk. 
 Turn the dough out to a floured board, cut and cook in deep fat hot enough to make a doughnut rise to the surface quickly and brown each side for about 1 minute. 
 If you want to add a few more calories, put sugar and nutmeg or cinnamon in a bag and some doughnuts and shake or smear some good chocolate on top.
