 About Shiso : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Shiso on Wikipedia 
 Perilla is a genus of perennial herb that is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae. The most common species is Perilla frutescens var. japonica or Shiso which is mainly grown in India and East Asia. There are both green-leafed and purple-leafed varieties which are generally recognized as separate species by botanists. The leaves resemble stinging nettle leaves, being slightly rounder in shape. It is also widely known as the Beefsteak plant. In North America, it is increasingly commonly called by its Japanese name, shiso. In Korean English, it is usually called perilla. Its essential oils provide for a strong taste whose intensity might be compared to that of mint or fennel. Although it tastes a little bitter to some, it smells very good. It is considered rich in minerals and vitamins, has anti-inflammatory properties and is thought to help preserve and sterilize other foods.
