Description : 
       Spanish Potato Salad ( No Mayonnaise)     
 This tasty  potato  salad makes a nice change from the regular,and is very attractive as well ! I do recommend using the purple  onions  when possible, as the color is nice and they are sweeter.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ lbs  potatoes  (not baking  potatoes ) 
 ⅓ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 3 tablespoons  white wine vinegar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon fresh ground  black pepper 
 7 ounces  cherry tomatoes , cut in halves 
 ½ cup  purple onion , chopped or other  sweet onion 
 ½ cup  green olives , pitted 
 Directions : 
 Scrub  potatoes , and in a large pot of boiling salted  water , cook  potatoes  20 to 25 minutes until just tender. 
 If your  potatoes  vary in size, remove them individually as they reach this stage and allow the larger ones to continue cooking until they also are tender. 
 Drain  potatoes  and set aside until cool enough to handle. 
 In a large bowl, whisk together  oil ,  vinegar ,  salt  and  pepper  until well combined. 
 Add to this the  tomatoes ,  onion , and and mix well. 
 Remove skin from  potatoes , and cut into ½ inch pieces. 
 Add  potatoes  to the bowl of other ingredients, and mix well. 
 Serve well chilled.
