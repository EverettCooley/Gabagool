 About Green almonds : 
 The almond, scientifically called Prunus dulcis, Prunus amygdalus, or Amygdalus communis is a small tree belonging to the subfamily Prunoideae of the family Rosaceae. Like in the case of the cherry, an almond is both the fruit and the tree. The almond kernel is called “nut” in culinary usage, but in fact it is a drupe. The tree might be a native of southwest Asia and North Africa, but nowadays it can be found in British Isles and in many parts of the world. The almond leaves are lanceolate and serrated at their edges. The fruit has a downy outer coat that is called epicarp that encloses the stony shell, which is also named “endocarp”. The kernel is the seed itself. Almonds are also used in alternative medicine as carrier oil in aromatherapy; almond oil or “Oleum Amygdalae”is almost insoluble in alcohol but soluble in ether and chloroform, and it can replace olive oil. Almonds are delicious ingredients or ice-cream, Baklava, or simply sprinkled over different desserts. They are a great source of vitamin E, and monounsaturated fat.
