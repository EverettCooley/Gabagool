      Belgian waffle     A traditional food, created in Belgium, which is square in shape with deeply indented pressed pockets evenly distributed around the square surface of the waffle. Over time, there have been so many alterations made to the shape and ingredients that today the Belgian waffle is often made differently than in past years. The batter prepared for this waffle contains yeast, so unlike commonly used waffle mixtures that allow faster use, Belgian waffle batter requires time to rise before it can be used. The yeast adds lightness to the waffle that is difficult to duplicate with replacement ingredients, such as baking powder and baking soda, which are commonly being substituted to speed up the waffle making process.
