 Cook Time : 30 minutes 
 Serves : 8 
 Ingredients 
 2 large  eggplants  (1¼ lbs) 
 2 tbsp  tahini 
 4 cloves of  garlic , peeled and crushed 
 3 tbsp fresh  lemon juice  or more to taste 
 4 tbsp cold  water 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 ⅛ tsp freshly ground  black pepper 
 ½ tsp  olive oil 
 1 cup chopped  tomato 
 ½ cup diced  onion 
 parsley sprigs to garnish (optional) 
 Directions 
 Pierce the eggplants in several places with a toothpick or fork. Wrap each eggplant in aluminum foil and place on a gas grill or in the oven at 500°F. 
 Cook until the eggplants collapse and begin to release a lot of steam, about 10–15 minutes. Remove the foil and place the eggplants into a bowl of cold water. 
 Peel while eggplants are still hot and allow them to drain in a colander until cool. Squeeze pulp to remove any bitter juices and mash the eggplant to a puree. 
 In a food processor, mix tahini, garlic, onion, tomato, lemon juice, and water until mixture is concentrated. 
 With the blender running, add the peeled eggplant, salt, pepper, and olive oil. 
 Serve in a shallow dish and garnish with black pepper, tomatoes, and parsley.
