 Ingredients 
 2 large baking  potatoes 
 2 medium  red bell peppers , cored, seeded, and cut into ½ inch thick wedges 
 5  garlic  cloves, peeled and smashed 
 1 small  jalapeño  or other hot chili pepper, quartered and seeded 
 1¼ to 1½ pounds of white fish fillets ( sole ,  halibut , or  cod ) 
 1 tablespoon sweet  paprika 
 3 ripe  tomatoes , coarsely chopped 
 1 cup chopped fresh  cilantro  or  parsley 
 1 cup  water 
 ⅓ cup  olive oil 
 coarse salt, to taste 
 Directions 
 In a large flame-proof casserole dish or Dutch oven, set the potato slices on the bottom. Scatter the bell peppers, garlic, and jalapeño pepper on the potatoes. Sprinkle with salt. Place the fish on top and sprinkle it with paprika and salt. Add the tomatoes and cilantro or parsley. 
 Pour the water in at the edges. Sprinkle the top with oil and sprinkle generously with salt. 
 Set the pan over high heat, cover, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 25–30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and the fish is cooked through. Check the pan after 20 minutes; if there seems to be too much liquid, uncover the pan for the remaining cooking time. Serve hot or warm with  challah .
