 About pepper jelly : 
 Pepper jelly is typically a blend of red or green bell peppers, chile peppers, spices, vinegar, and pectin (some recipes also call for sugar). It is a wonderful accompaniment to cold cuts and cheeses. It can also be baked with brie for a zesty treat. Heated up, it can be used as a healthy chicken and shrimp dip, or use as a baked chicken glaze.
