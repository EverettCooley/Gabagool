A combination of a marinade and a spice mixture used to season a variety of foods before they are grilled or roasted. In Spanish, Recados means "complements" in reference to its use to enhance the flavor of foods. By combining mixtures of spices, annatto seeds, chiles, onion, cilantro, peppercorns, and citrus juice (most often orange), a paste or sauce is created that is used to baste fish, meats, poultry, seafood, and vegetables before being grilled. In addition to a Recados marinade, the food will often have a salsa as an accompaniment to provide an additional flavor to the prepared dish.
