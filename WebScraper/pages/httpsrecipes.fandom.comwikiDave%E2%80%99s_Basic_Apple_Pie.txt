Description : 
 Featured for the Fourth! by Chef David Nelson
 
 Contributed by  SF&SC Y-Group 
 Ingredients : 
 5 or 6 large  Granny Smith apples , peeled, cored and sliced 
 ½  lemon , zested and juiced 
 1 cup  sugar 
 ⅓ cup  flour 
 1 tbsp  arrowroot  or  cornstarch 
 1 pinch of  salt 
 1 tsp  allspice 
 3 tbsp  butter 
 2 prepared  pie crusts , or your favorite recipe 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 350°F. 
 Put the apple slices in a large bowl and add the zest and the lemon juice. 
 Toss to coat the apples. 
 In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, flour, arrowroot, salt and allspice and mix thoroughly. 
 Add the sugar mixture to the apples and stir gently to coat. 
 Place the bottom crust into a 10-inch pie pan and top with apple mixture. 
 Dot the top of the apples with pea size pieces of the butter. 
 Top with second crust and crimp edges. 
 Make 4 small slices in the crust for steam to escape. 
 Wrap the edge of the pie with a piece of tin foil that just covers the crimped crust. 
 Place the pie on a cookie sheet. 
 I line mine with foil for easy clean up. 
 Bake for 45 minutes. 
 Remove foil and return to oven for about 30 minutes. 
 Juices will run out of the pie usually. 
 I wait until they show signs of thickening. 
 Place on a wire cooling rack for an hour or so before slicing.
