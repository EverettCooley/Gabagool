Ingredients : 
 1 can  red kidney beans , drained (the mid-sized can) 
 1 can  chickpeas , drained (same size) 
 2 can  tomatoes  (larger sized can 16 oz / 500 ml, I think) 
 1  green pepper , chopped 
 1 large  onion , diced 
 1 each  garlic  cloves to taste 
 2 to 3 cups frozen vegetables (I used  corn ) 
 ½ to 1 cup grated fat-free  cheese  (optional) 
 1 each cooked  couscous  or other  grain  of choice 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in large casserole dish, and bake in 400°F oven for 45 minutes. 
 You may add ½ – 1 cup grated ff  cheese  the last ten minutes of cooking, but i don"t think it really needs it. 
 Serve over  couscous  (or any other  grain  you like) it was rather liquid, next time, I think I will drain the  tomatoes , reserving liquid, and adding until it "looks right".
