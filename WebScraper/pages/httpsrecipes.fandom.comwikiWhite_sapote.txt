 About White sapote : 
 Wikipedia Article  About White sapote on Wikipedia 
 A tropical fruit native to Mexico and Central America, though its also grown in California and Florida. The sapote is plum-shaped and about the size of a small orange. The thin skin ranges in color from chartreuse to yellow. The ivory colored flesh has a creamy, custard-like texture and a sweet flavor that is reminiscent of a peach-avocado-vanilla blend. The flesh contains from 3 to 5 medium-size seeds, which should be removed. White sapotes are available in the fall in some specialty produce markets. Ripen at room temperature as you would an avocado. Store ripe fruit in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Also called zapote blanco.
