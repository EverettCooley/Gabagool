This is the toffee that I make and everyone at school loves. Credit to Mom on Timeout [1] . I got the recipe there and changed it a little.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Roughly 1 cup  pecans 
 1 cup  butter 
 1 cup  granulated sugar 
 A pinch  salt 
 A couple handfuls of  chocolate chips 
 Instructions : 
 Line a baking sheet/pan-type-thingamabob with parchment paper and scatter the pecans around the bottom. 
 Boil the sugar, butter, and salt over low heat until it reaches 300 F, or 'Hard Crack' on a candy thermometer. If the ingredients start to separate, turn off the heat and stir until they re-combine. 
 Pour the sugar mixture into your baking sheet/pan-type-thingamabob and let it cool for a bit. 
 Before it's completely cooled, put the chocolate chips on top. Once they melt, spread them around evenly. 
 Let it cool completely, then eat it all before anyone sees you.
