 Ingredients : 
 1Â kg of  semolina   flour 
 6  eggs 
 1 liter of tepid  milk  (a liter is 4.23 cups) 
 1 liter of tepid  water 
 2 packets of  yeast  dissolved in tepid  water 
 1 tablespoon of  salt 
 Olive  oil  for cooking 
 Syrup:
 
 1/2 cup of  Honey 
 1/2 stick of  butter 
 Melt the  butter  in a pan, add the  Honey  and heat through.
 
 Directions : 
 1) Put the  flour  in a bowl, add the  salt ,  eggs  and  milk . Blend with your hands to combine the ingredients. Add the  yeast . Slowly add the  water , you might not need all of it or you may need more. When the batter is loose enough you can use a whisk to break up any lumps. .
 2) A ladle that holds 1/2 cup of batter is good for an 8" skillet. Heat the skillet with a bit of olive  oil  until it starts to smoke, ladle in the batter and smooth out the crepe with the back of the ladle. 
 3) The pan must be hot otherwise the holes will not form. If the holes do not form your batter is either too thick or the pan is not hot enough. Making baghrir takes a bit of practice.The bottom should be golden.
 4) Flip the crepe and cook for just a couple of minutes.
