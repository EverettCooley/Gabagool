 About Queso enchilada : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Queso enchilada on Wikipedia 
 Añejo cheese is a firm, aged Mexican cheese traditionally made from skimmed goat's milk but most often available made from skimmed cow's milk. After it is made it is rolled in paprika to add additional flavor to its salty sharp flavor, which is somewhat similar to Parmesan cheese or Romano cheese, but not as strong flavored as Cotija cheese. As a fresh cheese, it is crumbly and breaks into small pieces very easily. When dried it acquires a firm texture allowing it to be easily shredded or grated. Queso Añejo is a good baking or grilling cheese, which is generally sprinkled on top of or stuffed into enchiladas, burritos and tacos. Parmesan, Cotija, or Feta cheese can be substituted when Añejo is not available. It may also be referred to as Añejo Enchilado cheese or Añejo (meaning "aged").
 Anejo cheese is an "aged" white Mexican cheese with a dry, crumbly texture and a salty flavor. Look for it in Mexican markets and well-stocked grocery stores. Grated romano, Parmesan, or feta can be substituted.
