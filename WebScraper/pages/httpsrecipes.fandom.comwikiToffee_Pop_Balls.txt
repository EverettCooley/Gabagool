       Toffee Pop Balls     
 Ingredients : 
 1 (250g) packet of toffee pop biscuits, which have been chilled in the fridge (if you are in the UK you can use the same quantity of Twix bars - or any biscuit which has creamy to) 
 250 g  cream cheese  (full fat seems to works best) 
 ¼ cup  icing sugar 
 3 tablespoons  Bailey's Irish Cream  (optional) 
 ½ cup desiccated  coconut 
 Directions : 
 Process the biscuits in a food processor until they resemble small chunky bits of biscuit. 
 You don't want fine crumbs. 
 If you don't have a food processor you can put these in a bag and bash with a rolling pin -very therapeutic after a hard day at work! beat the  cream cheese ,  icing sugar  and baileys (if using) until well combined and creamy. 
 Add the ground biscuits and combine until well mixed. 
 Add  coconut  a little at a time until the mixture is relatively stiff. 
 It should still feel a bit gooey as it will harden in the fridge. 
 Cover the bowl and put in the fridge until this is firm, which should take about 2–4 hours. 
 Put the remaining  coconut  in a bowl. 
 Using a teaspoon, take small amounts of the biscuit mixture from the bowl and roll into balls, then roll in the  coconut . 
 Keep in a container in the fridge until using.
