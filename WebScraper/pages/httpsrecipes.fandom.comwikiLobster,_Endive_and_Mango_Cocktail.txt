Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  mayonnaise 
 ⅓ cup plain  yogurt 
 2 tbsp  cognac 
 1 tbsp  ketchup 
 1 tbsp fresh  lemon juice , or to taste 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 4 x 1½-pound  lobsters 
 3  mangos , firm and ripe 
 1 cup  celery , finely diced 
 4 whole  endives , plus 12 leaves for garnish 
 3 tbsp minced fresh  chives  plus 24 whole  chives  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl whisk together  mayonnaise ,  yogurt ,  cognac , ketchup,  lemon juice , and  salt  and  pepper  then chill covered. 
 Plunge the lobsters into a large kettle of boiling salted  water  and boil them, covered, for 10 minutes. 
 Transfer the lobsters with tongs to a bowl and let them cool until they can be handled. 
 Crack the shells, remove the meat, and cut it into ¾-inch pieces. 
 Transfer the lobster meat to a large bowl and chill it, covered. 
 The lobster cocktail may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance. 
 Halve the  mangos  by cutting just to the sides of each pit and, using a ¾-inch melon-ball cutter, scoop the flesh from the  mango  halves (about 2 cups). 
 To the lobster meat add the  mango  balls,  celery , whole endives, trimmed and sliced thin crosswise, the minced  chives  and sauce, then toss mixture until combined. 
 Divide the lobster mixture among 12 chilled small glasses and garnish each serving with 1 of the  endive  leaves and 2 of the whole  chives .
