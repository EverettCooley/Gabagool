 About Ginger ale : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Ginger ale on Wikipedia 
 Ginger ale is a soft drink flavored with ginger. Brands in North America include Canada Dry, Vernors, Seagram's, Schweppes, Sussex, Buffalo Rock, Ale-8-One, and Blenheim Ginger Ale. It is popular in mixed drinks and is often used as a home remedy for upset stomachs, because of the ginger, but the high levels of sugar and the osmotic charge can affect the bowels more than the desired effect of the ginger. Sometimes, it is used to fill some social roles of champagne for those who do not drink alcohol. A Boston cooler is a drink made with vanilla ice cream and Vernors ginger ale. It has nothing to do with Boston, Massachusetts but was invented at an establishment on Boston Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan.
