Help Foodie celebrate repeal day by adding cocktail recipes : 
 
 December 5, 2007 marks the 74th anniversary of repeal dayâ€”a day which marks the end of prohibition in the United States. For more information on repeal day, please see  the Dewar's Repeal Day website  and  repealday.org .
 To celebrate, Foodie is going to create a special alcoholic drink portal and expand it's roster of alcoholic recipes (right now there are only 4 with half of them being for eggnog).
 You can help by adding alcoholic drinks recipes. All you need to do is click  here  and follow the instructions. Please tag the recipes with "Alcohol" or "Beverage" (or both) so they can be found easily for inclusion on the repeal day page. Thanks!
