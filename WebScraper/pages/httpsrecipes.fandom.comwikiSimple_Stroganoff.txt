Description : 
 I got this recipe from my daughter. She made it last night for dinner, and everyone in her family loved it! She said it was a little watery, so she suggested adding a small amount of flour to thicken it. She said that the next time she makes it, she will put it in the crockpot. I think I would also add some fresh mushrooms.
