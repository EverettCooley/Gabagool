Blondies with Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze
 -- Blondies --
 12 Tbsp (1-1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 large egg
1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1-1/3 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
 -- Glaze --
 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup peanut butter, either smooth or crunchy
 To prepare the blondies: With an electric mixer, beat together the 
butter and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Beat in the egg and 
vanilla. Add the flour and baking powder, beating just to blend.
 Transfer the batter to a lightly greased 8-inch square baking pan. 
Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 20 minutes, until the cookies 
test done. Cool on a rack.
 To prepare the glaze: In a small heavy saucepan, combine the 
chocolate chips and peanut butter. Put over medium-low heat and stir 
until melted. Pour over the blondies and spread evenly. Cool at least 
1 hour to allow glaze to harden.
 Makes 15 bars.
