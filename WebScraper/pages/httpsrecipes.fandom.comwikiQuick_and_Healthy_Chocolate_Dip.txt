Ingredients : 
 2 cups plain fat-free  yogurt 
 1/4 cup Dutch-processed  cocoa powder 
 2 tablespoons  Sugar  (to taste) 
 Directions : 
 Stir all ingredients together, making sure there are no white streaks of  yogurt  left. 
 Let rest, refrigerated, for 30 minutes if possible. The flavours will really develop and the dip will thicken. 
 Serve with a fruit platter, or top with whipped topping or chopped  nuts
