Ingredients : 
 approximately 60 small  freshwater fish 
 4  lemons 
 3 – 4  eggs  (depending on size) 
 freshly milled  white pepper 
 a bunch of  parsley 
 deep frying  oil 
 pork fat 
 flour 
 Directions : 
 First the fish should be descaled. 
 This is done by holding the main fin and scraping the fish with a short, not too sharp knife, in the direction of the head. 
 With a very sharp knife, slit the length of the belly of the fish and remove the entrails. 
 Dip the fish in  salt  and  pepper , pour the juice of the  lemons  over them and ensure that they are thoroughly coated. 
 Put 150 grammes of  flour  in a bowl and dip each fish into it until covered. 
 In farmhouse cooking, the fish would also be dipped in a beaten  egg  and drained. 
 In a deep fryer mix  oil  (¾) and  pork  fat (¼) and heat to 180°C. 
 Cook the fish in portion quantities until golden brown. 
 Serve on a preheated plate and garnish with slices of  lemon . 
 As friture are traditionally eaten with the fingers, it is wise to supply guests with a bowl of fresh  lemon   water . 
 That is to wash their hands, and not to drink. 
 For that purpose,  riesling  is used.
