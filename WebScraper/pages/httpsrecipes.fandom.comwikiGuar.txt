 About Guar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Guar on Wikipedia 
 The guar bean or cluster bean is an annual bean grown principally in India and Pakistan, with smaller crops grown in the USA, Australia and Africa. The most important growing area centres on Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India.
 Guar is drought-tolerant and can be eaten as a green bean, fed to cattle, or used as a green manure.
 Guar beans have a large endosperm that contains galactomannan gum, a substance which forms a gel in water. This is commonly known as guar gum and is used in dairy products like ice cream and as a stabilizer in cheese and cold-meat processing. Another use is as a fibre supplement. After being partially hydrolyzed it is completely soluble in water and soft food. Being approximately 75% dietary fiber, it allows the undetectable addition of fibre to either a foodstuff or diet.
 It can also be used in industrial applications such as the paper and textile industry, ore flotation or the manufacturing of explosives. Guar gum has also proven a useful substitute for locust bean gum (from carob).
 The current demand for guar gum outstrips supply and guar is being introduced into new growing areas. At this moment about 40% of the world production of guar gum comes from India.
