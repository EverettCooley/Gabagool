It can be used and prepared for its firm and hearty texture in rice salads and rice pilaf dishes. The complete contour and rosy color make it a magnificent option for many meals showcasing rice. It goes extraordinarily well with steamed vegetables, grilled fish and light meats. You will combine red rice with white rice in order to obtain a textural dish and a visual importance. Himalayan red rice is the long-grain, untilled rice with red bran, has a nuttier complex essence, and can also be found in India. This type of rice is full of B vitamins and cholesterol.
