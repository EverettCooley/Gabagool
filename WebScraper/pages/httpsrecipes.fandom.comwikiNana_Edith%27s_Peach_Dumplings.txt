 Description : 
 My Czechoslovakian Nana Edith used to make these every Summer. We'd look forward to her call telling us she found ripe  peaches , & to please come to lunch. She taught my mother to make them & she taught me. They may take a little practice & patience, but are well worth it! We still make a meal of them, but are great after a big salad or small dinner. I usually use only four large  peaches  since the dough is the best part! Can be served hot, cold, or room temp. They can also be made smaller with  apricots . 
 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 large ripe  peaches 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 2  eggs , beaten 
 4-5 tablespoons  cream  or half-and-half 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt 
 1/4 teaspoon  Sugar 
 1 tablespoon  butter , melted 
 Topping 
 
 1 cup  butter , melted,browned & clarified 
 8 tablespoons  Sugar , mixed with 
 cinnamon 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Stir together  flour ,  eggs  and four tablespoons of the  cream  until a stiff dough forms, just holds together. 
 Add more  cream  ONLY if the dough isn't holding together. 
 Mix in  salt ,  Sugar  & the melted  butter . 
 Knead on floured board until smooth, about 8-10 times. 
 Cover with a warm bowl and let rest for 1/2 hour. 
 Put a LARGE pot of lightly salted  water  on to boil. 
 Wash and dry  peaches , but DO NOT PEEL OR PIT! 
 After dough has rested, cut into four equal pieces. 
 Flatten& stretch each piece of dough around one  peach . 
 Make sure entire  peach  is covered& there are no holes! 
 Place dumplings in boiling  water , cover & cook for 20 minutes. 
 Remove with slotted spoon, drain well & put each  peach  in its own bowl. 
 Split the dumplings with two forks. 
 We leave the pits in for presentation, but they can be taken out. 
 Drizzle each dumpling with  cinnamon sugar  &  clarified butter  to taste.
