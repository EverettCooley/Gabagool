A white to cream colored egg with brown speckles that is laid by a hen turkey. Similar to chicken eggs, except larger, turkey eggs weigh approximately 80 to 90 grams (one and a half times more than a large chicken egg) and are slightly larger than a jumbo chicken egg. They have a flavor that is very similar to a chicken egg and contain 135 calories, 9 grams of fat, and almost 740 mg of cholesterol, all of which are significantly higher than for a jumbo chicken egg. Since turkey producers have a low rate of egg production per bird, most of the turkey eggs are used for hatching more turkeys, so they are seldom available to the consumer except in some specialty markets.
