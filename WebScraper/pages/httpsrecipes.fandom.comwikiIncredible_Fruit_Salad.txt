Ingredients : 
 ½ a  pineapple 
 ½ a  honeydew melon  or  cantaloupe 
 2 cups  watermelon , cut into chunks 
 1 cup seedless  grapes , red or green 
 1 cup  strawberries , halved 
 2  kiwi fruits 
 1  apple 
 2  oranges  or tangerines 
 juice of one fresh  lemon 
 Tofu Fruit Dressing : 
 225 grams (about 8 oz) soft unflavoured  tofu 
 4 – 6 tbsp  maple syrup 
 1 – 2 tsp  vanilla 
 2 – 3 tsp  arrowroot flour  or  cornstarch  (for thickening...but it's optional) 
 ½ tsp  cinnamon  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Prepare all the fruit by peeling, coring (if necessary) and cutting it into chunks or slices as desired. 
 Toss together in a large bowl with the  lemon juice  (to keep it from discolouring); or you can arrange the different fruits on a large platter and use the  tofu  dressing as a dip. 
 Rinse the  tofu  well and dry thoroughly between several layers of paper towels or clean cloth towels. 
 Break the  tofu  into small pieces and put in your blender or food processor. 
 Add the remaining ingredients (except the  arrowroot powder  or  cornstarch ) and blend. 
 Taste and adjust the sweetener if desired, then blend again. 
 Add the  arrowroot  or  cornstarch  to thicken, if desired, and blend yet again. 
 Chill thoroughly, then toss into the fruit salad, or use as a fruit dip. 
 This recipe also works well as a " whipped cream " on whatever your heart desires.
