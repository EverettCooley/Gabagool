 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  walnuts  (6 oz.) 
 2 cups old-fashioned  rolled oats 
 1/2 cup  rice flour 
 1/4 tsp.  salt 
 1/2 tsp. ground  cinnamon 
 1/4 tsp.  allspice 
 1/4 tsp. grated  nutmeg 
 1/4 cup  vegetable oil 
 1/3 cup  brown rice syrup 
 1/3 cup pure  maple syrup 
 1 Tbs.  vanilla extract 
 3 Tbs. all-fruit preserves 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 °F. Place  walnuts  on baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Lightly brush 3 baking sheets with  oil  or line with parchment paper; set aside.
 
 Meanwhile, put  Oats  in food processor and pulse on/off 6 times. Add  rice flour ,  salt ,  cinnamon ,  allspice  and  nutmeg  and process to blend. Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula, pulse 2 more times to thoroughly combine. Transfer mixture to large bowl.
 
 While  walnuts  are still warm, grind them to a paste in food processor. Add  oil ,  rice syrup ,  maple syrup  and  vanilla  and process until blended and smooth. Add mixture to dry ingredients and mix until just blended. (Dough will be sticky.)
 
 Scoop out heaping teaspoonfuls of dough. Roll into balls and flatten to form cookies about 1 3/4 inches in diameter. (It’s helpful to dip hands and utensils in  water  when working with this sticky dough.) With your thumb, make a deep indentation in center of each cookie. Fill each indentation with about 1/4 teaspoon fruit preserves. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.
