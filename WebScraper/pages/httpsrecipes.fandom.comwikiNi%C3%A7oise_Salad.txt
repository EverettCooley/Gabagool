 Description : 
 For a summer lunch or dinner, one of my favorite salads. There is always a debate going on about this salad, what should be in there and what not. I don't use  potatoes  in mine, but if you like to add them, do so. This recipe also appeals to kids. I serve it with some nice bread, and, of course, wine.
 
 Ingredients : 
 lettuce  leaves, of your own choice 
 2 – 3 hard-boiled  eggs , quartered 
 2 – 3  tomatoes , skinned and in large chunks 
 1 clove crushed  garlic 
 ⅓ cup  black olives , halved or left whole 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 Can Tuna 
 1/2 cup. boiled green beans 
 Directions : 
 Toss together carefully:  eggs ,  garlic  and half of the  olives ; add  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Pile in the center of the serving dish; make it look as attractive as possible ingredients.
