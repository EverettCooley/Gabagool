 Ingredients : 
 1Â lb.  soft tofu 
 1 tsp.  vegetable oil 
 2 large scallions (white and light green parts), finely chopped ( 1/4 cup) 
 1/8 tsp.  ground turmeric 
 1/2 tsp.  salt 
 6 to 8 medium  basil  leaves, cut crosswise into fine shreds (1 Tbs.) 
 1 Tbs. snipped  chives 
 1 Tbs. finely chopped fresh  dill 
 1 Tbs. finely chopped fresh flat-leaf  parsley 
 Directions : 
 1. Cut  tofu  block in half horizontally, then cut in half lengthwise, keeping block intact. One at a time, take a piece of  tofu  in your hand. Holding it over sink, squeeze  tofu  gently but firmly until it crumbles slightly and  water  drips out. When about half the moisture has been removed, place  tofu  in bowl. Repeat until all  tofu  has been squeezed.
 
 2. In nonstick skillet, heat  oil  over medium-high heat. Add scallions. Stir just until they sizzle, 30 seconds. Add  turmeric ,  salt  and  tofu . Stir with wooden spoon, breaking up  tofu , until it is evenly golden and moist, about 1 minute. Mix in  basil ,  chives ,  dill  and  parsley . Stir gently until  tofu  looks like well-set scrambled  eggs , about 1 minute. Serve immediately.
