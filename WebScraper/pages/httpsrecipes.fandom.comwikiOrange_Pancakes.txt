Description : 
 I like Arrowhead Mills pancake mixes. They have a variety of them -  buckwheat , wholewheat, multigrain, etc. Just mix up all the above to the consistency you like for thickness by adding more of the pancake mix - I like a really crêpe-style pancake so I can roll them and fill them with all fruit and  lemon juice  or low  salt  fat-free pie fillings (Pet  cherry ) and top them with the low or no-fat version of  Cool Whip  - this makes an awesome dessert. The  orange  flavor combined with the spongy quality of the cakes due to the  egg  whites is really a wonderful treat. You can adapt this recipe to french toast too.
