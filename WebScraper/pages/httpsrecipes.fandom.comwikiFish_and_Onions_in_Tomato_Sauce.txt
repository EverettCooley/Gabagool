Fish, stuffed with onions and/or peppers then pan-fried, seems most popular along the Atlantic coast of Africa. The Enya (Wagenia) and Manyanga people use fish traps attached to scaffolds built over the Congo river rapids. Senegal's Ceebu Jën and Mulet Farci à la Saint-Louisienne are more eleborate dishes which employ a similar stuffed fish technique.
