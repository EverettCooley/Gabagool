Description : 
 Ok, recipe for some really awesome  tomato  soup. It is *not* low in fat although it probably could be altered to be lower in fat than it actually is. The original recipe came from The New Basics cookbook and has been shamelessly altered since.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ stick  unsalted butter  (or possibly  margarine  if you prefer, or 4 tbsp  olive oil  could probably work well) 
 2 medium  onions , sliced thinly 
 3 large  carrots , chopped moderately small 
 6 cloves  garlic , minced 
 3 cans whole  tomatoes  in juice (no  salt  if you so prefer) 
 4 cups  water  and enough instant  chicken stock  to make 4 cups stock 8 leaves 
 fresh  basil , chopped fine 
 1 tsp dried  basil , crumbled 
 ½ tsp  allspice 
 ½ tsp  nutmeg 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 2 cups  heavy cream  (haven't tried  soy milk  yet, though) 
 4 leaves fresh  basil , chopped fine 
 Directions : 
 Melt the  butter  in a large pot, saute the  onions ,  carrots , and  garlic  until the  onions  just start to carmelize (i usually add the  garlic  somewhat later so it doesn't burn). 
 Add the  tomatoes , stock, and spices except the fresh  basil  and cook for 5 minutes. 
 Add the  basil  and cook for 50 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. 
 In batches, puree soup in a blender and return to the pot, or you can use an immersion blender which will also work but the veggie pieces won't be quite as small. 
 Add the  cream  and heat through. 
 Adjust seasonings, serve with some of the additional  basil  sprinkled on top. 
 Very good with fresh bread or  grilled cheese sandwiches .
