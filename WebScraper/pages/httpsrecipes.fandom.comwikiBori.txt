Bori are lentil dumplings that are dried and hard. Boris are added to curries and gravies to enhance the flavor and numerous variations to making these boris exist. Boris can also be added to dry vegetable dishes, commonly with spinach and peas, and the dish is consumed with rice and Dal. A fond Bengali memory is that of Boris left to dry for a day spread on a piece of cloth on the rooftop, while children of the household seriously engage in keeping the birds off the Boris.
