 Directions : 
 Heat a generous amount of  olive oil  in a heavy skillet, and fry the  seitan  "steaks" in it until browned on each side. 
 Toast the bread. 
 In a small saucepan, toast the  whole wheat flour  over medium heat until it starts to brown and becomes aromatic. 
 Stir in the  nutritional yeast  flakes and  olive oil  to make a thick paste. 
 Cook until it starts to sizzle and bubble, then, using a wire whisk, stir in the  water  and soy sauce.
