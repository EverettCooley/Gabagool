 Description : 
 Toast with delicious  avocado   mush  on it!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 to 2  California avocados 
 balsamic vinegar 
 Dijon  mustard 
 Virgin  olive oil 
 garlic  clove 
 sourdough bread  (or any other bread) 
 Directions : 
 Make a nice vinaigrette using  balsamic vinegar , virgin  olive oil , dijon  mustard , and a good deal of chopped fresh  garlic  (it should look as if there is too much  garlic  in there.
 Take a few tablespoons of  olive oil  and add some  mustard  and  vinegar . beat with a fork until it emulsifies and gets creamy (be patient.) 
 Add lots of chopped  garlic , mix, and let sit for 20â€“45 minutes to get the flavor of the  garlic  out.
 Slice bread and toast it.
 Take your  avocado  and empty it into a bowl, minus the pit and skin. 
 Take a fork and  mush  it up a bit, leaving it chunky (not like guacamole) yet spreadable.
 Take the vinaigrette and add it to the  avocado  and mix a little bit.
 Once the toast is ready, just scoop some  avocado   mush  and put it on... it's delicious.
 You can make it with  tomatoes , too...
