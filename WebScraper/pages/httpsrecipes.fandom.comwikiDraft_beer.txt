 About Draft beer : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Draft beer on Wikipedia 
 Draught beer has several related though slightly different understandings. Most references to draught beer are to filtered beer that has been served from a pressurised container, such as a keg or a widget can. A narrower meaning, beer that is served from a keg (or tap), but not from a can, bottle or cask, is also used. A more traditional definition is beer that is served from a large container, which could be either a keg or a cask. The different understandings may at times overlap and cause confusion. Some traditionalists object to the more modern use of the word when applied to canned beer. The slight usage differences of the term are due to the history and development of beer dispensing.
 Beer served straight from the keg by means of a spigot. Unlike the bottled or canned varieties, draft beer hasn't been subjected to the Pasteurization process. Also spelled draught.
