 Wikipedia Article  About Chaource cheese on Wikipedia 
 Chaource is a French cheese, originally manufactured in the village of Chaource in the Champagne-Ardenne region.
 Chaource is a cow's milk cheese, cylindrical in shape at around 10 cm in diameter and 6 cm in height, weighing either 250 or 450 g. The central p√¢te is soft, creamy in colour, and slightly crumbly, and is surrounded by a white penicillium candidum rind.
 Similar to camembert, chaource cheese takes its name from a town in France's Champagne region. It has a white, downy rind with an ivory-colored center. The fruity, rich flavor intensifies and becomes saltier as it matures.
