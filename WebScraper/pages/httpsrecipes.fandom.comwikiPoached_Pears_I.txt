Description : 
 This recipe is best made at least 30 minutes in advance to give the  pears  time to cool.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  pears , preferably Bosc 
 2 tbsp fresh  lemon juice 
 1 cup  cranapple juice 
 Directions : 
 Halve, peel, and core the  pears . 
 Sprinkle freshly cut  pears  with  lemon juice  to prevent  browning . 
 Place in microwave-safe dish and cover with cranapple juice. 
 Cover and cook on high 6 â€“ 8 minutes or until  pears  are fork tender. 
 Spoon juice over  pears , cover, and let stand 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight. 
 I love the texture and buttery flavor of poached  pears . 
 This microwave poaching method is so simple that sometimes i buy a big bag of  pears  and poach them all at once. 
 They can then be refrigerated and covered and eaten as snacks throughout the next week. 
 Bosc and  bartlett pears  are the best varieties for poaching. 
 This is a nice holiday recipe because the  cranberry juice  turns the  pears  a pale pink color. 
 These  pears  are pretty garnished with some fresh  mint  sprigs.
