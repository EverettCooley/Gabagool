Description : 
 Fool  is an old-fashioned custard and fruit dessert native to England, but popular in English-speaking Africa. In the original English fool,  gooseberries  are traditionally used. In Africa, the custard may be made from  coconut milk , and tropical fruits such as mangoes are substituted. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  milk 
 2  eggs , lightly beaten 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 3 tablespoons  water 
 3 tablespoons  sugar 
 ripe fruit: two  mangoes , or one  papaya , or two  bananas , peeled, seeds (if any) removed, and cut into pieces 
 Directions : 
 Make the custard from the first three ingredients: heat the milk in a double boiler, or in a saucepan over low heat. 
 Do not boil. 
 In a bowl, mix the half cup of sugar into the beaten eggs. 
 Slowly add about a quarter of the heated milk to the egg-sugar mixture, while stirring continuously. 
 Slowly stir the egg-sugar-milk mixture into the remaining heated milk. 
 Cook on low heat, until it thickens into a custard, stirring gently and continuously. 
 Spoon it into a clean bowl and place in the refrigerator to cool. 
 While the custard is cooling, cook the fruit: bring the water and three tablespoons of sugar to a boil in a saucepan. 
 Add fruit pieces. 
 Reduce heat and cook until tender, 5 – 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Mash fruit, or press it through a sieve. 
 Spoon it into a clean bowl and place in the refrigerator to cool. 
 To serve, gently fold together custard and fruit. 
 Spoon the mixture into serving bowls.
