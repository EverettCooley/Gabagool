Description : 
 Serve as a meal for 4 or as part of a banquet for 4–6. Only use the freshest eggs for this. By scrambling the eggs first, you retain the very best qualities of the eggs – fluffy, light texture and vibrant yellow hue. This is delicious served with some freshly sliced chilli.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 free-range  eggs 
 ⅔ cup finely sliced  spring onions  (scallions) 
 2 tablespoons  light soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon finely diced  ginger 
 2 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 1 small  red onion , finely diced 
 4 cups steamed  rice 
 1 tablespoon  light soy sauce , extra 
 1⅓ cups finely shredded  Chinese cabbage  leaves 
 Directions : 
 Place eggs in a bowl with spring onions, soy sauce and ginger and lightly beat with a fork to combine. 
 Heat oil in a hot wok until surface seems to shimmer slightly. 
 Add onion and stir-fry for 30 seconds. 
 Pour in egg mixture and leave to cook for 10 seconds before folding egg mixture over onto itself with a spatula and lightly scrambling for about 1½ minutes or until almost cooked through. 
 Add rice and extra soy sauce and stir-fry for about 1½ minutes, using a spatula to break up the egg into smaller pieces. 
 Lastly, toss in cabbage and stir-fry for 20 seconds or until well combined and rice is heated through. 
 Transfer rice to a platter and serve.
