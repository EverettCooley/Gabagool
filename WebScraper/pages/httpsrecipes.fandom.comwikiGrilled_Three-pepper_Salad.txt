Description : 
 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Wilson Estate in Elmo, Texas in 1992. Dated 1962. This is one of my mother's favorite salads. If you love peppers, you will love this pretty and very tasty delight. Serve it with pride.
