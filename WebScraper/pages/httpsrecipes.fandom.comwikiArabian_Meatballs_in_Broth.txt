 Description : 
 This recipe yields 4 servings.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup quick-cooking  rice cereal  (½ minute to cook) 
 1 cup minced  onion 
 2 tbsp minced  garlic 
 1½ tbsp  tomato paste 
 6 cup  beef broth 
 2 tbsp  long-grain white rice 
 ¾ lb ground lean (7% fat or less)  beef 
 ½ tsp  salt  - (about) 
 ¼ tsp freshly-ground  pepper  - (about) 
 ¼ cup chopped fresh  mint  leaves 
 2 tbsp chopped  parsley 
 2 tbsp  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Mix  rice cereal  with ⅓ cup cold  water ; let stand at least 5 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan, stir half the  onion  and 1 teaspoon  garlic  over medium-high heat until limp, about 4 minutes. 
 Stir in  tomato  paste, broth, and  rice . 
 Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until  rice  is tender to bite, 12 to 15 minutes. 
 As  rice  cooks, mix  beef  with ½ teaspoon  salt  and ¼ teaspoon  pepper . 
 Mix half the  beef  mixture with one-fourth of the  rice  cereal mixture, remaining  onion  and  garlic , 1 tablespoon  mint , and  parsley . 
 In a food processor, whirl remaining  beef  mixture and remaining  rice  cereal mixture until it is a sticky paste. 
 Shape each of the meat mixtures into 4 oval pieces. 
 In your palm, flatten 1 piece of the  beef  paste until it's ¼-inch thick. 
 Lay a coarse- beef  oval over the thin piece and fold paste around it, shaping into a 3-inch-long football. 
 Repeat to form each meatball, and as shaped, drop into simmering broth. 
 Simmer over low heat, covered, turning meatballs once, until no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 10 minutes. 
 Add  lemon juice , remaining  mint , and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Ladle meatball soup into bowls.
