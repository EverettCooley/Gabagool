 Description : 
 This recipe, which I first made in a high school "home ec" class, combines a peanut butter filling with a chocolate crust that should satisfy any chocoholic, especially one who's a fan of Reese's®. Best of all, no baking required! As a side note, for convenience, consider using a pre-made chocolate crust from the store.
