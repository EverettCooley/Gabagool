 Wikipedia Article  About Straw mushroom on Wikipedia 
 Volvariella volvacea (also known as straw mushroom or paddy straw mushroom; syn. Volvaria volvacea, Agaricus volvaceus, Amanita virgata, Vaginata virgata) is a species of edible mushroom cultivated throughout East and Southeast Asia and used extensively in Asian cuisines. In Chinese, they are called cǎogū (草菇, lit. "straw mushroom").
 They are often available fresh in Asia, but are more frequently found in canned or dried form outside their nations of cultivation.
 
       Straw mushroom     Popular in Asian cooking, straw mushrooms are so named because they're grown on straw that's been used in a paddy. This musty, earthy growing medium contributes its distinct nuances to this mushroom's flavor. Tiny (about 1 to 1½ inches in diameter) and coolie-shaped, straw mushrooms range in color from pale tan when young to dark charcoal gray when mature. Fresh specimens of this cultivated mushroom can sometimes be found in specialty produce markets. More readily available are canned straw mushrooms, which are found in Asian markets. Also known as paddy straw mushrooms and grass mushrooms.
 Named for the beds of straw on which they grow in China, are small, plump brown mushrooms that resemble closed umbrellas and have a mild flavor and a tender texture. Also known as umbrella mushrooms, they are most often sold canned and should be rinsed before using.
