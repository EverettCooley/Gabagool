Latvian-style cheese danishes
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  milk 
 2½ cups  flour 
 1 package (1 tbsp)  yeast 
 5 tbsp  butter 
 5 tbsp  sugar 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 2 lbs (dry)  cottage cheese 
 raisins  (to taste) 
 10 tbsp  sugar 
 1 package Oetker's  vanilla sugar 
 1 package Oetker's  vanilla pudding powder 
 juice of half a  lemon 
 2  eggs , separated 
 Directions : 
 Dough : 
 Put  milk  in saucepan and heat until bubbles start to form. 
 Let it cool until lukewarm. 
 Then add one tbsp. 
 sugar ,  yeast , and let stand about 10 minutes. 
 Add enough  flour  to make a soft dough. 
 Let this rise for 20 minutes. 
 cream   butter , add  sugar  and  salt . 
 When dough has risen (for the 20 minutes) add the  butter  mixture, and remaining  flour . 
 Let rise for about one hour. 
 Filling : 
 Beat  cottage cheese  with a fork (or run through a Cuisinart-type food processor) to break up the lumps. 
 Add  sugar ,  vanilla   sugar , pudding powder,  lemon juice ,  egg yolks , and  raisins . 
 Beat well. 
 Whip  egg whites  and fold into  cottage cheese  mixture. 
 Pastries : 
 Preheat oven to 325°F. 
 Roll out batter onto a cookie sheet, and spread with filling. 
 Alternately: make a number of small, Danish-style pastries and spoon filling into centre of each one. 
 Bake for 30 – 50 minutes. Put on a rack to cool. 
 If made in a sheet, cut only when cooled. 
 This has fewer calories than a traditional  cheese  Danish, but tastes just as good, if not better!
