 Mix ingredients well and spread over the inside and outside of the animal. 
 Allow to marinate for up to one day to allow flavors to meld.

 The spit should be inserted into the back part of the animal and exit from the jaw. 
 Once on the stick, tie the front and back feet, stretching out the legs. 
 Put on grill, turning manually. 
 Continue to apply lard to the skin to avoid drying out the meat. 
 The cuy is ready when the skin is close to bursting.

 If your community is especially progressive, rice may be substituted for the potatoes.
