 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup chopped  carrots 
 ½ cup chopped  mushrooms 
 ½ cup chopped  zucchini 
 1½ cups low-sodium  tomato juice 
 1½ teaspoons  Italian seasoning 
 2 tablespoons grated  Parmesan cheese 
 ½ pound  ground turkey  breast 
 ¾ pound lean  ground round 
 ¼ cup finely chopped  onion 
 ½ cup rolled  quick-cooking oats 
 2  egg whites 
 1 teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce 
 ⅛ teaspoon  salt 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper 
 1 teaspoon  balsamic vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Combine carrots, mushrooms and zucchini in small saucepan. 
 Stir in ½ cup tomato juice and ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning. 
 Cover and cook over medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. 
 Uncover and allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until most of juice has cooked away (watch carefully so it doesn't cook dry or scorch). 
 Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. 
 Spray a broiler pan with nonstick spray coating. 
 Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine ground meats, ½ cup tomato juice, onion, oats, egg whites, Worcestershire sauce, remaining 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, salt and pepper; stir well. 
 Spoon meat mixture onto a sheet of wax paper and press lightly into a 9-inch-by-10-inch rectangle. 
 Spoon vegetable mixture over meat. 
 Use wax paper to gently roll meat, jellyroll fashion, forming a loaf about 10 inches by 4 inches. 
 Transfer to prepared pan and place loaf seam side down. 
 Bake at 375 degrees 50 minutes. 
 Cook remaining ½ cup tomato juice in small, uncovered saucepan 5 minutes or until slightly reduced. 
 Stir in balsamic vinegar. 
 Brush tomato-juice mixture over meatloaf. 
 Continue baking meatloaf about 10 minutes or until meat thermometer registers 165°F and meat is no longer pink inside. 
 Allow to stand 10 minutes before slicing.
