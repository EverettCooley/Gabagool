Description : 
 This makes a large batch, but they freeze very well and make a ready snack for someone hungry for a really good donut. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup cold mashed  potatoes 
 3 cups  rice flour  (white, regular grind which is finer than the  brown rice flour  found in health food stores) 
 ½ cup  cornstarch  or  soy milk  powder (not soy bean powder) 
 1 cup  sugar 
 5½ teaspoons Rumford  baking powder 
 ½ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 1½ cup  milk  (or  milk  substitute) 
 3  eggs 
 powdered sugar 
 Directions : 
 Beat all this together or mix will by hand. 
 This should be slightly stiffer than cake batter. 
 Let it sit for 15–30 minutes. 
 Fry ¼ cup or smaller spoonfuls of batter in hot  oil , a few at a time until they are good and brown. 
 Check one for doneness by breaking open the first donut to see if it is completely done. 
 rice flour  products are very unpleasant when they are not completely done, but get too dry if overdone. 
 Drain well and roll in  powdered sugar  or  cinnamon sugar  or dip in  vanilla  or  chocolate   powdered sugar  glaze.
