Description : 
 Cauliflower with olive oil and lemon
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  cauliflower 
 salt 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin  olive oil 
 1 clove  garlic  (optional) 
 juice of 1  lemon 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Wash and trim the  cauliflower  and cut it into florets. 
 Boil in salted  water  until just tender, then drain. 
 Heat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin  olive oil  in a pan. 
 Some like to soften a little crushed  garlic  in the  oil . 
 Add the  lemon juice ,  salt , and  pepper  and turn the  cauliflower  in this over low heat.

 Some serve it with  tarator  bi  tahina  (cucumber-yogurt salad and tahini).
