Description : 
 Portuguese-style shrimp. This is a delicious and quick  Shrimp  saute using typical Portuguese ingredients like  red wine  and plenty of  garlic  and  parsley . The  saffron  makes it a little different, and a touch of  crushed red peppers  at the end of cooking make it wonderful!

 4 tablespoons  butter 
 ¼ cup  onions , minced 
 ½ cup  water 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 4 tablespoons fresh  flat-leaf parsley , chopped 
 1 teaspoon  turmeric  or  ginger 
 ½ teaspoon  saffron  threads, soaked in 1 tbsp warm  water  for 15 minutes 
 ½ cup  red wine 
 2 teaspoons fresh  lemon juice 
 1 teaspoon coarse  sea salt 
 black pepper 
 ¼ teaspoon crushed  red pepper flakes 
 1 lb  shrimp , peeled and cleaned 
 Directions : 
 Saute  onion  in the  butter  until almost browned; reduce heat slightly and add  garlic ,  parsley , and  turmeric . 
 Saute another 5 minutes then add  water  and  saffron   water . 
 Cover and simmer for 5 more minutes. 
 Stir in wine and  lemon juice ; bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes to cook off some of the alcohol.
