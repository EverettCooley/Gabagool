 Description : 
       Milagu Vadai     
 Ingredients : 
 urad dal  - 1 cup 
 Whole  pepper  - 1 Â½ tsp. 
 asafoetida  - a small piece 
 salt  to taste 
 oil  For deep-frying 
 Directions : 
 Clean the  urad dal  well and soak it in  water  for about 30 minutes. Take about two-tablespoons of whole  urad dal  and keep them aside. Grind the remaining  dal  to a smooth and firm paste by adding  water  little by little, whenever necessary. Add  salt  to the ground paste. Crush the whole  pepper . Do not make them to a fine powder. Add the crushed  pepper  to the ground paste and mix all the ingredients thoroughly well. Next add the whole  urad dal  which was set aside to the paste and mix them all well. Heat  oil  in a kadai. Take a small clean plastic paper. Take small portions of this ground paste and place it on the plastic sheet. Flatten this with wet fingers till they become very thin. Take these out of the plastic sheet carefully and deep-fry them till it becomes golden brown and crisp.
