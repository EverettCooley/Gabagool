 Wikipedia Article  About Dry jack on Wikipedia 
 Monterey Jack is a type of semi-hard cheese using pasteurised cowsâ€™ milk. It is commonly sold by itself, or mixed with Colby cheese to make a marbled cheese known as Colby-Jack (or Co-Jack).
 One story of the origin of the name is that it was first made in the town of Monterey, California by a large land-owning family named the Jacks. They produced a mild, white cheese at their ranch, which came to be known at first as "Jack's Cheese", and eventually "Monterey Jack".
 An aged version of this cheese, known as Dry Jack, can be grated and used much like Parmesan cheese.
 Another version called Pepperjack mixes hot peppers with Monterey Jack for a zesty flavour. Pepperjack is often used as an alternative cheese in dishes such as quesadillas, but can be eaten with bread or crackers for a tasty snack.
