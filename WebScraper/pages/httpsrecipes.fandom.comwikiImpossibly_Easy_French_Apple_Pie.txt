Description : 
 I think this is like a cross between a cobbler and a cake, rather than like a pie. I baked mine in a small glass baking dish instead of a pie plate, since it is a lot easier for me to cut squares than pie wedges! (Also I have a cover for my square dish.) For the baking mix, I used half Reduced Fat Bisquick and half Hodgson Mills Whole  Wheat   buttermilk  baking mix. I also used a bit less  Sugar  in the pie part of the recipe since I thought the streusel topping and  Apples  gave it plenty of sweetness. From Bisquick.
