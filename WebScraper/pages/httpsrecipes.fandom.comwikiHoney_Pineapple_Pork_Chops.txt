 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup  light soy sauce   or   tamari 
 ¼ cup  white vinegar 
 ¼ cup extra virgin  olive oil 
 ¼ cup fresh or canned (packed in juice) crushed  pineapple 
 2 tbsp  honey 
 2 tbsp minced  ginger 
 2  garlic  cloves, minced 
 4 boneless center cut  pork chops  or boneless  pork loin  (about ½-1 inch thick) 
 Directions : 
 To make marinade, stir all the ingredients together in a small bowl. 
 Place the  pork  chops in a shallow dish and cover with the marinade. 
 Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. 
 Prepare the grilling machine for cooking. 
 Drain the  pork  chops reserving the marinade. 
 Place the chops on a hot grill and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, basting occasionally if desired with the reserved marinade until nicely browned and cooked thoroughly. 
 Juices should run clear when a chop is pierced with a fork at the thickest part,and no pink should remain.
