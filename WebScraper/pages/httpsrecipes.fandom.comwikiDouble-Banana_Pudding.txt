Description : 
         
 This simple, no-cooking-required recipe comes from my paternal grandmother, and is a variation on the classic banana pudding recipe that comes on the back of the vanilla wafer box.
 
 Serves: 6 to 8 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups cold  milk 
 1 package Jell-O ®  Vanilla Flavor Instant Pudding & Pie filling 
 1 tub (8 ounces)  Cool Whip  Whipped topping, thawed 
 30  vanilla wafers 
 3  bananas , sliced 
 Directions : 
 Pour milk into large bowl. Add pudding mix. 
 Beat with the wire whisk for 2 minutes. 
 Let stand 5 minutes or until thickened. 
 Gently mix or stir with 1 ½ cup of the whipped topping. 
 Place 10 of the cookies on the bottom of 2-quart serving bowl. 
 Top with ⅓ of the bananas and ⅓ of the pudding mixture. Repeat layers ending with the pudding mixture. 
 Cover with the remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate or freeze until ready to serve. 
 Notes : 
 Even though a serving bowl is called for, my grandmother used to serve this in a casserole dish.
