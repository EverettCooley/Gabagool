       Slöngukaka - "Snake cake"     
 "Snake cake"
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  eggs 
 150 – 200 g  sugar 
 50 g  flour 
 50 g  potato starch 
 Chocolate buttercream : 
 50-73 g  margarine   or   butter , soft 
 50 g  brown sugar 
 1  egg yolk 
 2 tbsp dark  cocoa 
 1 tsp  vanilla sugar   or   vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Cream together the  eggs  and  sugar . 
 Add the  flour  and  potato starch , little by little. 
 Prepare a temporary baking container by putting baking paper on a baking sheet and folding in the corners to make a shallow "box". 
 Pour in the dough and smooth with a spatula. 
 Bake at 250 °C for about 10 minutes. 
 Set the oven to heat from below. 
 Test for doneness by gently pressing the top of the cake with your finger - if the cake feels firm and the fingerprint quickly disappears, the cake is done. 
 When done, turn the cake over onto a sheet of baking paper sprinkled with  sugar . 
 Put a roasting pan or cutting board on top of the cake while it cools, to keep it smooth and prevent it from hardening. 
 Chocolate buttercream : 
 Cream together  margarine  and  brown sugar . 
 Add the  egg yolk  and mix well. 
 Add the flavouring and sifted  cocoa . 
 When the cake is cold, smooth the  butter   cream  over one side of it and firmly but carefully roll up the cake. 
 Slice and serve with a dollop of  whipped cream . 
 Variations : 
 Instead of chocolate buttercream, you can use white  butter  icing with the flavouring of your choice,  chocolate  pudding or jam.  Strawberry  or  raspberry  jam tastes especially good with this kind of cake.
