Ingredients : 
 3 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1  yellow onion , diced 
 1  carrot , peeled and minced 
 2  celery  ribs, minced 
 3  garlic  cloves, minced 
 1 teaspoons  cumin  seeds 
 1/2 teaspoon  crushed red pepper  flakes 
 3 cups  black beans , soaked in  water  overnight and drained 
 1 jalapeño, or 2 for more heat 
 2  bay leaves 
 kosher salt 
 freshly-ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Heat the  olive oil  in a large heavy stockpot over medium heat. Add the  Onion ,  carrot , and  celery , and cook them until they are tender and fragrant, about 15 minutes. Add the  garlic  and saute for 2 minutes more. Add the  cumin  and red pepper, and stir for 1 minute. Add the  black beans  and 6 cups of  water . 
 Using a paring knife, make several lengthwise slits in the jalapeño, add it to the soup, and add the  bay leaves . Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer the beans until they are completely tender and begin to fall apart, 40 to 90 minutes, depending on the age of the beans. As the beans cook, add more  water , if needed, to keep them from becoming too dry. 
 Remove and discard the jalapeño and the  bay leaves . If you like, you can puree half the beans using an immersion blender, or simply cook them for 15 minutes more, until they nearly dissolve. 
 Stir the soup, taste, and season with  salt  and  pepper . Ladle into soup bowls and serve immediately. Or refrigerate, and reheat when ready to serve. 
 Serve with your favorite salsa, or some grated  Cheddar   Cheese , if you like.
