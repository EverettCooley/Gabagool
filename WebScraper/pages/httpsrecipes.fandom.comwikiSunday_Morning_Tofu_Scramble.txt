Description : 
 I actually usually double this recipe, the leftovers reheat nicely. Of course, you can change the seasonings as you like. How about using  peas  instead of zucchini and season with  curry  sometimes I add  veggie sausage  or seasoned  seitan . Use your imagination.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 to 12 ounces firm low-fat  tofu 
 1 medium cold baked  potato , cubed not peeled 
 1 small  onion  or several  scallions  chopped 
 several  mushrooms , sliced 
 1 small  zucchini 
 Â½ cup  salsa 
 Directions : 
 Brown the cubed  potato  in a dry non-stick skillet add  onions ,  mushrooms  and zucchini cook until veggies are done. 
 Crumble  tofu  with a fork, add to the skillet and heat thoroughly season with salsa, add  peppers  if you like it spicey, I like the pickled jalapeno slices. 
 Serve as is or wrap in a  tortilla  for a breakfast burrito.
