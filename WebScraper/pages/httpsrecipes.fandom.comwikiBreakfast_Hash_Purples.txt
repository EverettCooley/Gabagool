Description : 
 Sorry about the approximate amounts. I make this different every time. We find that the combination of purple, green, red, and white makes a dish that is a visual delight. It's also a low fat replacement for those greasy breakfast hash browns.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1  purple potatoes 
 1  green onion  (amount according to taste) 
 1  garlic  (amount according to taste) 
 1  red pepper  (amount according to taste) 
 salt 
 pepper 
 cayenne pepper powder   or   paprika  (depending on heat desired) 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  purple potatoes  in a bowl of  water  for about a half an hour. 
 This makes it very easy to scrub the skins, eliminating the need to peel them and lose those nutrients. 
 After scrubbing, pat them dry and cut them into approximately ¾" cubes. 
 Be careful where you cut them, as they can stain ( purple potato  juice!). 
 Put them in a mixing bowl. 
 Wash, trim, and slice the  green onions . 
 Add to  potatoes . 
 Finely chop the  garlic  and add to  potatoes . 
 Wash and cut up the  red peppers  to taste. 
 I like fairly large hunks of sweet red pepper. 
 Add  salt ,  pepper , and  pepper  powder to taste. 
 Spray a little bit of pam or other  cooking spray  in a non-stick roasting pan. 
 Bake in a 400 °F oven for approximately ½ hour. 
 This time will vary with the size and amount of the  potato  pieces. 
 Stir occasionally while baking. 
 I have found that ensuring that they lie in a single layer works the best and yields a crispy, not soggy, crust on the  potatoes .
