Ingredients : 
 1 medium  potato  (Yukon gold  or   red potatoes  are the best) 
 2 slices of fresh  whole grain  vegan  french bread 
 1 â€“ 2 slices  soy cheese 
 sliced  tomato 
 rosemary  to taste 
 dillweed  to taste 
 dash  salt 
 dash  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Slice the  potato  into medium thick slices (you will have leftover  potato  so i suggest you bake the rest and save it for later). 
 Layer about 3-5 slices (more or less to your preference) between pieces of vegan  bread . 
 Cover in foil and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until  potatoes  are tender. 
 Go read a good novel while this is baking. 
 You can probably polish off " Of Mice and Men ". 
 After  potatoes  are to your liking, open sandwich and top with  soy cheese , sliced  tomatoes  and seasonings. 
 Replace top slice of vegan  bread  and either bake or broil.
