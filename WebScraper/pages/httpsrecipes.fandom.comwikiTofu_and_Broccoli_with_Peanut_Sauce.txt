       Tofu and Broccoli with Peanut Sauce     
 Ingredients : 
 The Sauce : 
 ½ cup unprocessed  peanut butter 
 ½ cup hot  water 
 ¼ cup  cider vinegar 
 2 tablespoons  tamari 
 2 tablespoons  blackstrap molasses 
 ½ teaspoon  cayenne pepper 
 The Sauté : 
 1 (1 lb) bunch fresh  broccoli  (frozen will do) 
 3 tablespoons  oil 
 8 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 lb  tofu , cut into small cubes 
 3 dashes  salt 
 2 cups thinly-sliced  onions 
 1 cup coarsely-chopped raw  peanuts 
 2 – 3 tablespoons  tamari 
 Directions : 
 The Sauce : 
 In a small saucepan, whisk together the  peanut butter  and hot  water  until uniform in consistency. 
 Whisk in the remaining ingredients. 
 Set aside. 
 The Sauté : 
 Cut off the bottom half-inch of the  broccoli  stems. Shave off the tough outer skins of the stalks with a sharp paring knife or a vegetable peeler. 
 Cut the stalks diagonally into thin slices. Coarsely chop the flowerettes. Set aside. 
 Begin heating the large skillet. When it is hot add 1 tbsp of the  oil . 
 Add half the  garlic .  Salt  lightly. 
 Sauté over medium heat for 1 minute, then add the  tofu  chunks. 
 Turn the heat up a little, and stir-fry the  tofu  for 5-8 minutes. 
 Transfer it, including whatever liquid it might have expressed, to the saucepanful of  peanut  sauce. 
 Mix together gently. 
 Wipe the skillet with a paper towel, and return it to the stove to begin heating once again. 
 Add the remaining  garlic .  Salt  lightly. 
 Add the  onions , and some  black pepper . 
 Sauté, stirring frequently, over medium heat, until the  onions  are soft. 
 On another burner, begin heating the peanut- tofu  sauce on a low heat. It shouldn't actually cook-it only needs to be warmed through. 
 Add the  broccoli  and the chopped  peanuts  to the skillet. 
 Add 2 – 3 tbsp tamari and stir-fry over medium-high heat until the  broccoli  is bright green and just tender. 
 Pour the heated  peanut  sauce over the sauté. Toss everything gently until everything is coated with everything else. 
 Serve over long-grained white or  brown rice  (basmati is good).
