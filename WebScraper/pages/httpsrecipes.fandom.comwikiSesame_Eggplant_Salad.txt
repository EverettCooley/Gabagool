       Sesame Eggplant Salad     
 This intriguing salad is a great addition to any Asian or oriental meal. The dressing is sooooooo gooood that I'm having all the flavors in my mouth right now. This dressing would be great over noodles! Heck the dressing is so good I have also used to it marinate other vegetables.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons  canola oil 
 1½ lbs  Japanese eggplants , thinly sliced crosswise 
 ¼ cup  water 
 Dressing : 
 2 tablespoons  sesame seeds , toasted 
 2 tablespoons unseasoned  rice vinegar 
 2 tablespoons  soy sauce 
 1 tablespoon dark  sesame oil 
 1 tablespoon  canola oil 
 1 teaspoon  sugar 
 1 teaspoon minced  ginger 
 ½ teaspoon minced  garlic , I like more 
 ½ teaspoon Asian  chili sauce , to taste 
 3 tablespoons minced or slivered  green onions , including tops 
 Directions : 
 Place wok or skillet over high heat. 
 When hot, add 2 tbsp  oil  and swirl to coat the pan. 
 When hot but not smoking, about 1 minute, add  eggplant , stir fry about 1 minute. 
 Add  water , or more as needed, and continue to stir fry moving pan off and on the heat as necessary to prevent scorching, until  water  evaporates and  eggplant  is tender when pierced, about 5 minutes. 
 Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. 
 Mix all dressing ingredients in a bowl, whisk to blend. 
 Pour over cooled  eggplant  and toss to coat well. 
 To serve, mound on a serving plate and garnish with  onions .
