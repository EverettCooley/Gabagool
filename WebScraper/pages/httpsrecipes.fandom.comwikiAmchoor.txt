 Wikipedia Article  About Amchoor on Wikipedia 
 Dried unripe mango used as a spice in south and southeast Asia is known as amchur (sometimes spelled amchoor). Am is a Hindi word for Mango and amchoor is nothing but powder or extract of Mango.
 Amchur (amchoor) powder is also referred to as "mango" powder. It is made from dried, ground mangoes. The spice imparts a tart and slightly sour flavor to many Inidan dishes including fish, meats, vegetables and curries.
