Ingredients : 
 1 cup  molasses 
 1 tablespoon  ginger 
 ½ cup  shortening ,  butter  and  lard  mixed 
 1 tablespoon  soda 
 2½ cups  bread flour 
 2 tablespoons warm  milk 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 Directions : 
 First heat  molasses  to boiling-point, add  shortening ,  ginger , soda dissolved in warm  milk ,  salt , and  flour . 
 Toss one-fourth of mixture on a floured board and roll as thinly as possible; shape with a small round cutter, first dipped in  flour . 
 Place near together on a buttered sheet and bake in a moderate oven. 
 Gather up the trimmings and roll with another portion of dough. 
 During rolling, the bowl containing mixture should be kept in a cool place, or it will be necessary to add more  flour  to dough, which makes cookies hard rather than crisp and short.
