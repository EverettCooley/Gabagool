 Thunder Tea rice. This is a traditional dish for the Hakka Clan of the Chinese. This dish is normally prepared during the 7th day of the Chinese New Year, where the whole family will reunite and eat together. I think this is the spirit that makes this dish so special. Anyway, the taste of the dish may be strange to some, as this is an acquired taste kind of dish.
