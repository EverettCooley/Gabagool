Description : 
 Gin Thoke ( ginger  Mix) is a great dessert to top off a Burmese meal.
 
 Ingredients : 
 125 g (4 oz)  young, fresh ginger 
 4 – 6 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 2 tablespoons  peanut oil 
 1 tablespoon  sesame oil 
 12 cloves  garlic , sliced 
 2 – 3 tablespoons  sesame seeds 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 For this recipe, the  ginger  must be young (nearly transparent skin). If all you have available is mature  ginger , then use the knobs that grow off the main root. 
 Peel the  ginger  and cut it into thin slices, then slice them into thin strips (approximately the size of matchsticks). 
 Marinate the sliced  ginger  in  lemon juice  for 60 minutes. 
 While the  ginger  marinates, heat the  peanut  and  sesame oil  and then slowly fry the sliced  garlic . 
 When the  garlic  turns slightly golden, remove it from the pan and transfer it on absorbent paper to drain off the excess  oil . The  garlic  will become crisp. 
 Next, in a dry pan, stir the  sesame seeds  over moderate heat. 
 Stir constantly until the  sesame seeds  turn golden brown. 
 Put the seeds on to a plate and let it cool. 
 Drain the  ginger  strips that you marinated. 
 Put the  ginger  strips in a bowl, add  salt  and sprinkle with  garlic  and  sesame seeds . 
 Toss lightly and serve.
