 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2½ l (3¾ pt)  water 
 1 kg (2 lb)  mealie meal  (white  maize flour )  or  rapoko (red  millet flour )  or  ordinary  millet flour 
 Directions : 
 Bring 1½ l (2¼ pt) of the  water  to the boil in a heavy-based saucepan with a long handle for easy handling. Mix half the mealie-meal with the remaining cold  water  to form a smooth paste. Add this paste to the boiling  water , stirring vigorously to avoid lumps, until it boils again. Cover and continue to boil for 5 minutes. 
 Gradually add the remaining mealie-meal, one-quarter at a time, stirring thoroughly and firmly until the whole mixture thickens. You need a firm wrist - as the mixture thickens, the porridge gets firmer and more difficult to stir. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook for another 3 minutes. 
 Wet a small bowl with cold  water  and use the wet bowl to form the mixture into individual portions. Alternatively, you can serve the Sadza as one large family meal. Serve hot with vegetables and stew or roast meat or with the gravy of your choice.
