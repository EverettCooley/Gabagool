About semi-firm cheeses : 
 Most semi-firm cheeses are pressed during production to remove moisture.  As they age, they become even firmer and more pungent and crumbly.  
 Most of these cheeses are great for snacks and sandwiches, and many can be cooked without becoming rubbery or oily.  
 Semi-firm cheese tend to have a longer shelf life than softer cheeses.  Many can last about 1-2 months in the refrigerator if the package isn't opened, 3-4 weeks if opened, and 2 weeks if sliced.
