The German cuisine is a very rich one, including dishes that start dinner as appetizers, and continue with soup- dishes, main course ones, and dessert dishes. Sometimes, the dessert is replaced with a specific German beer, worldwide known and very much appreciated. Wine or Sekt (a champagnes type of sparkling wine) are also part of the after dinner custom. Breakfast is a big deal as well, and usually consists of fresh baked bread, ham, salami and Leberwurst (a specific German type of sausage), different types of cheese, marmalade, honey or jam, muesli with milk, eggs and tea or coffee.
 Condiments in the German cuisine are not very spicy, except for those used in the sausage composition. Chili peppers, mustard and horseradish are the hottest spices used, and still not very often. Most popular spices are white pepper, garlic, oregano, juniper berries, caraway, parsley, thyme, laurel and chives. Basil and sage are also used more and more each day. The entire German cuisine has been influenced by other cuisines, such as Turkish, French or Italian cuisine, especially in fast food places. Kebab, spaghetti, pizza and French fries are everyoneâ€™s favorite in such a place, and Germans enjoy fast food more an more.
