      Austrian-Style Warm Potato Salad     
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound small  fingerling potatoes , washed 
 2 sprigs fresh  thyme 
 2½ tablespoons  kosher salt 
 1 small  yellow onion , finely chopped 
 3 tablespoons  sugar 
 ½ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 cup white  wine vinegar 
 ¼ cup  canola ,  safflower oil ,  or   peanut oil 
 ½ cup  chicken broth   or   vegetable broth 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh  parsley leaves   or   chives 
 Directions : 
 In a large saucepan, combine the  potatoes ,  thyme  sprigs, and 2 tablespoons of the  salt . 
 Add enough cold  water  to cover completely. 
 Bring to a boil over high heat. 
 Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the  potatoes  are just tender enough to be pierced easily with a skewer or the tip of a sharp knife, about 10 minutes. 
 Drain the  potatoes . 
 While they are still hot, peel them. As each  potato  is peeled, cut it crosswise into ¼-inch slices 
 Add to the hot  potato  slices the  onion , remaining  salt ,  sugar ,  pepper ,  vinegar , and  oil . 
 Stir gently but thoroughly with a large spoon to combine the ingredients. 
 Before serving, heat the broth in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. 
 Add the  potato  salad and stir it gently just until the  potatoes  are thoroughly heated. 
 Garnish with  parsley  or  chives  and serve immediately.
