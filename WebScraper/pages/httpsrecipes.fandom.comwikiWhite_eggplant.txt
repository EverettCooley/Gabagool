 About White eggplant : 
 Wikipedia Article  About White eggplant on Wikipedia 
 The most widely grown cultivars in Europe and North America today are elongated ovoid, 12-25 cm long and 6-9 cm broad with a dark purple skin. A much wider range of shapes, sizes and colours are grown in India and elsewhere in Asia. There, cultivars that closely resembles a chicken egg in both size and shape are widely grown; colours vary from white to yellow as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a colour gradient, from white at the stem to bright purple to deep purple, or even black, but white cultivars also exist. Chinese eggplant are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber. The name 'eggplant' dates to the 1700s, when the most common European cultivars of the fruit were white or yellow, and roughly the size and shape of a goose egg.
 Aubergine is the British name given to this fruit. This name comes from the French aubergine, derived from Catalan albergínia, from Arabic al-bAdhinjAn, from Persian بادنجان Bâdinjân, the eggplant.
 Numerous other names are used, many derived from the Sanskrit vatinganah, which has produced a number of names for this plant in various languages: brinjal, badingan, melongena, melanzana, berenjena, albergínia, aubergine, brown-jolly, and mad-apple (misinterpretation of Italian melanzana as mela insana).
 Oval or elongated oval shaped cultivars include, 'Harris Special Hibush', 'Burpee Hybrid', 'Black Magic', Classic', Dusky', and 'Black Beauty'.
