 Description : 
 Tunisian  Chickpeas  with Silverbeet
 
 Ingredients : 
 2/3 cup dried  Chickpeas  soaked in cold  water  overnight 
 1 bunch silverbeet, washed and stems discarded 
 3 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1 teaspoon ground coriander 
 1 teaspoon  turmeric 
 1/2 tsp ground  cumin 
 2 tsp  chilli  paste 
 1 tablespoons  olive oil 
 1 brown  Onion , peeled and finely chopped 
 1 tablespoon 'no added  salt '  tomato  paste 
 juice of 1/2  lemon 
 Directions : 
 Half fill a large saucepan with  water . Bring to the boil and add the drained  Chickpeas , reduce heat and simmer for about 40 minutes or until tender. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid. 
 Roughly chop the silverbeet leaves into large pieces, and steam for 1–2 minutes or until tender. Allow the cooked silverbeet to cool a little and then squeeze out the excess moisture.
 
 Combine  garlic , ground coriander,  turmeric ,  cumin  and  chilli  paste in a small bowl until a smooth thick paste forms. Heat the  olive oil  in a large frying pan, add  Onion  and cook over medium heat until pale golden. Add the  garlic  and  chilli  paste and the  tomato  paste and cook stirring frequently for 1 minute. Add the silverbeet, cooked  Chickpeas ,  lemon juice  and the reserved cooking  water  and cook for about 7–10 minutes stirring occasionally - avoid letting the mixture get too wet and soupy. 
 Serve with steamed  rice  as a main meal or as an accompanying vegetable side dish.
