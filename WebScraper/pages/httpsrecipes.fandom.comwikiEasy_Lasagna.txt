 Sorry this is not an exact recipe, I vary it. You should know how to make a rue and bechamel—easy just look it up. Make sure the no bake noodles are mostly 90% covered so they cook. If you use too little, they will be crunchy. I use Pizza cheese blend and Romano. Note, no ricotta. 
 Variation : 
 Add meatballs (crushed) in bottom layer.
