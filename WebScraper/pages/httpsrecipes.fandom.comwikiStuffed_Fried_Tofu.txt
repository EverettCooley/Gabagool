 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup cooked highly seasoned  rice , 
 such as Cajun Jambalaya Mix 
 4 cakes fresh  tofu 
 cornstarch  or  flour  (for dusting) 
 3 to 4 tablespoons  peanut oil 
 Hot  oil  or  mustard , for a dipping sauce 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  rice . If using the Jambalaya Mix, in a microwave-safe bowl add contents of package with 1 tablespoon  olive oil  and 3 cups  water . Cover. Microwave on high for 5 minutes, then on half power for 12 to15 minutes, or until  rice  is tender. Cool.
 Meanwhile, drain the  tofu  well in a colander and then on paper towels while the  rice  cooks. Cut each cake diagonally and then cut out a pocket on the cut side. Dust with the  cornstarch  or  flour . Fill the cavity with some of the  rice  mixture. Pack smoothly with a knife or with your fingers. Heat  oil  in a heavy bottomed skillet or wok. When hot enough to give off a haze, place side of the  tofu  cake down into the  oil  and pan-fry over medium heat about 6 minutes. Turn the cakes and fry the other side for 2 minutes.
 Serve hot with a nice sauce drizzled over the top.
