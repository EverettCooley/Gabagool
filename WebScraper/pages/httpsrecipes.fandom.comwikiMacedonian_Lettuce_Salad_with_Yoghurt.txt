Ingredients : 
 3 small  cos lettuce ; (Little Gem-type) 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 x 8 ounces thick Greek-style  yoghurt 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 1 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1 tbsp  oil ; ( olive  if possible) 
 Directions : 
 Separate the leaves on the  lettuce , wash them thoroughly and dry them. 
 Tear each of the bigger leaves in half and arrange in a bowl. 
 Not more than 5 minutes before you're ready to eat, sprinkle the  salt  over the  lettuce  and beat the  oil ,  lemon juice  and  sugar  into the  yoghurt . 
 Pour the  yoghurt  over the  lettuce  and toss gently and serve rapidly. 
 The  lettuce  will wilt if kept for more than 10 minutes in this dressing, but before then its crispness and the creaminess of the dressing complement each other wonderfully.
