      Prawns and Baby Squid in White Truffle Sauce     
 Ingredients : 
 Dublin bay prawns 
 baby  squids 
 “criadillas de tierra”  mushrooms 
 broad beans 
 2  onions 
 2  celery  branches 
 fennel 
 squash 
 2  carrotw 
 white truffle 
 olive oil 
 1 bunch  parsley 
 salt 
 almonds 
 capers 
 Directions : 
 We first produce the Dublin bay prawn blend. 
 Over the blend, we place the garnish. 
 Over the garnish we place the Dublin bay prawns and the baby squids. 
 Finally we add the  truffle oil  around the dish, not directly on the  squid . 
 Dublin bay prawn blend: we fry lightly the vegetables –  fennel ,  onion  and  celery  – previously chopped, together with the  almonds . 
 We separate the heads and then we peel the rest. 
 We dry the peelings in the oven (90°C). 
 With 2  carrots , 2  onions , 2  celery  branches, a  parsley  bunch and the  capers  we make a stock together with the dried peelings, boiling for 20 minutes. 
 Next we put the lightly fried vegetables, the prawns main parts and the heads in a casserole adding the stock at the end. 
 After boiled, we grind and strain it, getting the paste in that way. 
 Garnish: we chop the  squash  in little sticks. 
 Next we peel and boil the  broad beans . 
 We boil the  mushrooms  in  olive oil . 
 Then we fry the  squash  sticks, adding next the  mushrooms  also chopped in little sticks. 
 Finally we add the  broad beans , so we have the garnish made. 
 Truffle oil : 
 We make it with  olive oil . 
 Dublin bay prawns and baby squids: we cut the baby squids in rings and then we grill them. 
 We grill too the prawns. 
 Finally we assemble the dish as described previously.
