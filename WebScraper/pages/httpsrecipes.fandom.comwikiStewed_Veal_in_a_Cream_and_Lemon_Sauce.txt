 Found this in a  Lady's Home Journal  a couple of years ago. Very quick and very good!

 2½ lbs  veal 
 2 – 3  anchovies , chopped 
 2 sprigs fresh  thyme 
 20 fluid ounces  chicken stock  or  chicken broth 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1 ounce  butter 
 1½ ounces  plain flour 
 5 ounces  heavy cream 
 1 pinch  nutmeg 
 1  lemon , zest only 
 lemon  slices (to garnish)s 
 Directions : 
 Trim the  veal  of fat and sinews and cut it into neat cubes. 
 Put them into a saucepan with the  anchovies  and  thyme  and cover with stock. 
 Season lightly and simmer, covered for 1 hour or so until tender. 
 The  veal  must cook gently or it will shrink and toughen. 
 When completely tender, strain the stock into a jug and keep the  veal  on one side, removing the talks of  thyme . 
 Melt the  butter  in a saucepan and stir in the  flour . 
 When it starts to froth gradually add the  veal  cooking liquid, stirring it in between each addition. 
 Let it simmer for 10 minutes then stir in the  cream . 
 Season the sauce with  nutmeg  and  lemon  zest and if necessary with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Put the meat back in the sauce and simmer gently until heated through. 
 Serve garnished with slices of  lemon .
