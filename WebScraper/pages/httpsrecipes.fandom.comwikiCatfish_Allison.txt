Description : 
 You'll love this classic  catfish  recipe, featuring Parmesan, onions. Make it spicy-to-taste with a dash of Tabasco.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup grated  Parmesan cheese 
 ½ cup  butter  or  margarine , softened 
 6 tablespoons  mayonnaise 
 6  green onions , finely chopped 
 ½ teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce 
 generous dash of  Tabasco sauce 
 6 – 8 U.S. farm-raised  catfish  fillets 
 Directions : 
 Place  cheese ,  butter ,  mayonnaise ,  green onions ,  worcestershire sauce  and  tabasco sauce  in a bowl and mix thoroughly. The  cheese  mixture can be made 24 hours in advance and refrigerated; soften at room temperature before using. 
 Preheat the broiler. 
 Poach  catfish  fillets, two or three at a time, in a skillet of lightly simmering  water  for 4 to 5 minutes. Gently lift fillets from  water  with a slotted spatula and set aside on a plate to drain. 
 Place the fillets in individual au gratin dishes or in a baking pan large enough to hold them in a single layer. Spread 2 tablespoons of the  cheese  mixture over each fillet. Broil for 2 or 3 minutes or until the  cheese  mixture browns and fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. If using a baking pan, carefully lift fillets from the pan and place on serving plates; spoon some of the pan juices over each serving.
