An electric kitchen appliance that consists of a tall container with a removable lid and motor driven blades at the bottom that blend, chop, mix, or liquefy foods depending on the speed setting selected.
 There are a few types of specialty blenders. Hand blenders (also known as  Immersion Blenders) are great for making cocktails and for blending soups right in the cooking pot. Smoothie blenders have a special blending jar and a more powerful motor for dealing with tough ice and fruits.
