 Ingredients : 
 1Â lb. fully cooked Kielbasa, cut into 1/2-inch coins (slices) 
 2 c.  beer 
 2 c. shredded sharp natural  Cheddar   Cheese  (8 oz.) 
 2 c. shredded natural  Swiss cheese  (8 oz.) 
 2 tbsp.  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 tsp. dry  mustard 
 1/4 tsp.  black pepper 
 1 clove  garlic 
 1/8 tsp. red pepper sauce 
 2 tbsp.  kirschwasser   Liquor , if desired 
 Directions : 
 Heat Kielbasa in 1/2 cup  beer  to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Drain.
 
 Mix the  flour ,  mustard  and  black pepper  and dredge the cheeses until well coated. Cut the  garlic  and rub the bottom and sides of a 2-quart heavy saucepan or skillet. Pour in the remaining  beer  and place over low heat until bubbles rise to the surface. Add the  Cheese , ONE CUP AT A TIME. Slowly stir. Each cup must melt before adding the next cup. When mixture is smooth, add the  kirschwasser  and  black pepper  and mix.
 
 Pour mixture into your fondue pot. Keep warm over low heat. Spear the Kielbasa with long-handled forks; dip and swirl in the  Cheese  mixture. If the  Cheese  mixture becomes too thick, add heated  beer  until thinned enough to dip. Other good "dippers" are:  Rye  toast, bread sticks, or Triscuits.
