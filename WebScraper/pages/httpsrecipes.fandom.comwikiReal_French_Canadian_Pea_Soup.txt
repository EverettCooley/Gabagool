Description : 
 This pea soup recipe has been in my family longer than anyone can remember, and is AT LEAST as old as my great, great grandmother, probably older than that even. It is my favorite soup ever, and now it is my husband's fave too. This is a vegan version, although it is lacto-vegetarian normally. meat was only added to the soup by certain members of the family, and typically only for company.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  yellow split peas 
 5 cups  water 
 2 small  carrots , grated 
 1 small  onion , chopped 
 2 tablespoons  sunflower oil  or other light tasting  oil  or  butter 
 1Â½ cups  soy milk  or cows'  milk 
 salt  and  pepper , to taste 
 Directions : 
 Wash and rinse the  split peas , drain, and put in a large pot. Add the 5 cups of  water , and bring to a rolling boil. Let boil 2 minutes, turn the heat off and cover for 1 hour. 
 Add the  carrots ,  onions , and half of the  oil . Bring back to a boil, cover, then let simmer for 1 hour or until the  onions  are translucent. If a creamier, thicker consistency is desired, let it cook longer. 
 Add the remaining  oil ,  soy milk  and spices. Serve.
