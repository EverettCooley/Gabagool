This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased 
the family collection from the Blanton Estate in Heath, Texas in 
1992. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded very thin 
 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 
 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts 
 4 tablespoons sun dried tomatoes packed in oil cut julienne 
 2 teaspoons fresh cilantro chopped 
 1 tablespoon fresh chopped garlic 
 1/4 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese 
 2 teaspoons toasted pine nuts 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350. 
 Drizzle enough olive oil in the bottom of a casserole dish to lightly coat the bottom. 
 Sprinkle in chopped fresh garlic. 
 Divide feta cheese, pine nuts, tomatoes and cilantro amongst the 4 chicken breasts. 
 Roll chicken up and place seam side down into prepared dish. 
 After pan is full lightly pepper the tops. 
 Drizzle on a bit of the oil from the sun dried tomato jar. 
 Sprinkle with chopped garlic, Parmesan cheese and pine nuts then bake for 45 minutes.
