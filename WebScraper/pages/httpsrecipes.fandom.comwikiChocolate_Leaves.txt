chocolate  Leaves
 
 6 Camellia Leaves or Other Non Toxic Leaves, Rubbed, Tubbed And Scrubbed Clean. Dry With Paper Toweling. 
 1/4 Cup Semi Sweet  chocolate chips  (nestl?'s) Melted 
 
With The Back of a Spoon or With a Small Spatula, Spread  chocolate  on The Back of The Leaves. Place  chocolate  Side up on Waxed Paper And Place in The Refrigerator to Firm Up. When  chocolate  is Firm, Peel Off The Leaf And Voila! You Have The Prettiest  chocolate  Leaves. They Must be Kept in The Refrigerator Until Ready to Use And They Can be Prepared a Week in Advance. Store Them in a Plastic Container, With Wax Paper to Cover And Then The Lid. Note: i Made These With Both Dark And  white chocolate . i Tinted The  white chocolate  With a Drop or Two of Green  food coloring  to Resemble Leaves And They Looked Gorgeous on Top of a  white chocolate  Cheesecake.
