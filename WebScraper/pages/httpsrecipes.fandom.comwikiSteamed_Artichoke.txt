 Steamed Artichoke  from the Wikibooks Cookbook—original source of recipe, licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License
 
 Cook Time : 1 hour 
 Serves : 2-5 
 Ingredients : 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 1  artichoke 
 1  lemon 
 Optional seasonings : 
 Per artichoke
 
 parsley 
 1-2 cloves of  garlic 
 pepper 
 ⅛ cup  white wine 
 Optional cips : 
 drawn  butter 
 mayonnaise 
 Directions : 
 Cut off artichoke stem and head. 
 Remove base leaves and cut off pointy end of upper leaves. 
 Rub artichoke in lemon to preserve color. 
 Add salt (and any seasonings) to 3 inches of water, bring to low boil. 
 Place artichoke top down in pot tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke. 
 Boil on low 30–45 minutes until bottom can be punctured without resistance. 
 Place artichoke upside down to drain. 
 Serve whole, with one or more dips. Diners should remove a leaf, dip the base of the leaf in the dip, and eat the fleshy base of the leaf. 
 When all the leaves are gone, remove the choke, cut the heart of the artichoke into bite sized pieces, and serve with the dip.
