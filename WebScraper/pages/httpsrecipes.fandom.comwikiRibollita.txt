Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Ribollita

The word ribollita means twice boiled, referring to the fact that this Tuscan soup was originally simply leftover minestrone, reheated the next day and mixed with chunks of bread. But today this rich, thick soup is much more than leftovers. Slices or chunks of garlic-rubbed bread can be layered either with minestrone, but also simply with chicken broth, Parmesan cheese and cooked vegetables and white beans. The entire mixture is baked until bubbly hot, then served with a drizzle of olive oil.
