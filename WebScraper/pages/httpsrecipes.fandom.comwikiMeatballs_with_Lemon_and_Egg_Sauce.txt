 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  ground beef 
 ½ pound  butter 
 ¼ pound  rice 
 1  egg 
 1  white onion  finely chopped 
 1 teaspoon  parsley 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2 teaspoons freshly ground  black pepper 
 2  eggs 
 2  lemons 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients except 2 eggs and 2 lemons and mound into balls. 
 Put some water in a pot then place the butter and balls in it carefully. 
 Let them cook for 20 minutes then cool. 
 In a separate bowl beat eggs with a mixer and slowly while beating add the lemon juice ensuring that the sauce doesn't curdle. 
 With a ladle take some of the juice from the meatball pot then add to the sauce mixing constantly. 
 Keep doing this until all juice has been mixed in the sauce. 
 Empty all the sauce on top of the meatballs and serve with some sprinkled parsley.
