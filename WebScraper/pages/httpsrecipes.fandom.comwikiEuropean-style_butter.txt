 Wikipedia Article  About European-style butter on Wikipedia 
 Cultured butter is the most common type of butter in continental Europe, while sweet cream butter dominates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Because of this, cultured butter is sometimes labeled European-style butter in the United States. Raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States, and is rare in Europe as well.
