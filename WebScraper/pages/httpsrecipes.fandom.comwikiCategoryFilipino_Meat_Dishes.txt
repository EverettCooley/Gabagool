 Meat in the Filipino cuisine is mostly seafood based, using one of the largest variety available, from common seafood like shrimp, squid, clams, milkfish, mussels, and crabs, to more interesting ones like mackerel, grouper, eels, blue marlin, abalone and seaweeds. They are usually served in a spicy and sour broth, or a sweet and sour sauce, together with a side of rice. Seafood soups are commonly prepared and very much enjoyed, not matter if they are sweet, sour or hot. Shrimp can be prepared hot and sour, with watercress and walnuts, or with orange chili mint. Chicken is used as well in the Filipino cuisine, as part of an adobo dish, stewed in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf, or mixed with pork in an apretada dish. Pig blood, entrails and meat are used in a blood porridge dish, called dinuguan. Oxtail is sometimes used for cooking, preparing a peanut stew with mixed vegetables and fermented shrimp paste.
