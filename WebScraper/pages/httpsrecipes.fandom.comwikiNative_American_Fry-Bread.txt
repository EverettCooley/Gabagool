      Fry-Bread     
 Ingredients : 
 3 cup regular white  flour 
 1/2 cup dry  powdered milk  (I find this to be better than bottled  milk ) 
 1 tbl  baking powder 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 1/2 cup warm  water 
 2 qt  vegetable oil  or  shortening  for frying. 
 Directions : 
 Cast iron skillet is great for this frying, it holds the heat better. 
 Preheat your frying  oil  on Medium-high, but not "smoking" hot! 
 The quicker you fry your bread, then the more tender and soft it will be. 
 While your  oil  is heating, you can make the dough. 
 Mix the dry ingredients first, then add warm  water  gradually and mix with hand until you get a ball of dough that is not too sticky. 
 Pick off pieces of dough in the size of  eggs  and set them aside. You should have about 10 " eggs ". 
 Hand-shape the piece of dough into a disc that can fit into your pan. or, use the rolling pin on a floured surface and roll dough out into a disc. You can prepare all the discs first or make them as you go. 
 Now, fry the dough and watch closely. The frying  oil  should be medium-hot, but not smoking. 
 Fry the bread on each side a few minutes or until it is a nice light brown. 
 Use two forks to flip the bread over and be careful not to flip hot  oil  on yourself! 
 Drain the fry-bread on paper towels and serve immediately! 
 Notes 
 
 It is best fresh and not very good the second day. 
 You can put anything on Fry bread,  butter ,  chile , or  powdered sugar
