Ingredients : 
 1 package Any flavor Microwave Ready Little  Potatoes 
 1 Tbsp  Canola oil 
 1 cup  Pizza sauce 
 18 to 20 slices  Pepperoni 
 1 cup  Mozzarella   cheese , shredded
 
 Instructions : 
 Cook potatoes in microwave pack according to package directions (see notes below for alternate directions). Toss with oil and attached seasoning pack. 
 Place potatoes on a large plate (you can use the original container, but it won’t quite be large enough to hold all the potatoes in a single layer). Using the bottom of a glass, smash potatoes so they form a flat “crust” for your pizza. 
 Top with pizza sauce, a pepperoni slice, and sprinkle with cheese. Microwave for one minute on high or until cheese is melted. 
 Note: To use bagged Little Potatoes, coat with one tablespoon oil, sprinkle with salt and roast at 400°F for 30 minutes or until cooked. Smash, top, and broil until cheese is melted.
