Two or three racks of lamb can be combined end to end and then curved into a circle to make a "Crown Roast". This is a special preparation of guar of honor and may be available from some butchers without special ordering or the home cook can create it. You will need at least two rib racks to create the crown roast. Use three racks to give the crown roast a rounder shape and to provide more servings. After completing the steps in "Preparing a Guar of honor", perform the following simple steps to create the crown roast. Make a shallow cut in the flesh between each rib bone so that the rib racks will curve easily into the proper shape. Bend each rack into a semicircle and tie them together at the base, center, and top to hold the racks together. The rib ends should be pushed outward to create the look of a crown. The finished preparation may be roasted as is, however many cooks prefer to place stuffing in the cavity. As an option, gold colored frills or aluminum foil are often placed onto the ends of the rib bones to prevent the bones from scorching and to add a decorative touch. Be very careful not to burn the dish.
