Description : 
 The origin of Anzac biscuits emanates from World War I, when the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.
 Based on a recipe for Scottish oatmeal cakes, Anzac biscuits are made from  flour ,  rolled oats ,  desiccated coconut ,  golden syrup ,  brown sugar ,  butter  and  bicarbonate of soda . As eggs were scarce during wartime, none were used to make these delicious biscuits, instead  golden syrup  (or  treacle ) was used to bind the ingredients together.
 They were sent to Australian soldiers in the war by their families and are now often joked about as the 'Australian national biscuit'.
