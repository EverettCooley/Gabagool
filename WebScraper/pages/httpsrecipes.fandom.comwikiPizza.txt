 Made popular in the United States by soldiers who brought the idea back from Italy at the end of World War II, pizza is thought to have evolved from early Egyptian flat bread. Literally translated, the word means pie, but it has come to represent a round savory tart made with a crisp yeast dough covered with tomato sauce, Mozzarella and other ingredients, such as peppers, onions, Italian sausage, mushrooms, anchovies, and pepperoni. Variations such as the deep-dish pizza, with its thick bread-like crust, have been popular over the years. Many menus now feature pizzas sans tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. They're topped instead with ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, duck sausage, fresh basil, smoked salmon, goat cheese or wild mushrooms. Pizza originated from Italy.
