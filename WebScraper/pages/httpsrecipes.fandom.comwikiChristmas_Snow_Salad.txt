From Southern Living Holiday Meals 1982 
 2 envelopes unflavored gelatin 
1/2 cup cold water 
1 (15 3/4-oz) can crushed pineapple, undrained 
1 (1.25-oz) envelope whipped topping mix 
1/3 cup mayonnaise 
1/4 cup sifted powdered sugar 
1 (10-oz) jar red maraschino cherries, drained and chopped 
1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts 
Additional red and green maraschino cherries (optional) 
 Soften gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water; set aside. Drain pineapple, reserving 
juice; add enough 
water to juice to make 1 cup. Bring pineapple juice mixture to a boil, 
remove from heat, and 
stir in softened gelatin. Chill mixture until consistency of unbeaten egg

Prepare whipped topping mix according to package directions, omitting 
vanilla, fold 1 cup 
topping into gelatin mixture (reserve remaining topping for other uses). 
Gently fold next 
five ingredients and pineapple into gelatin mixture; pour into a lightly 
oiled 4-cup mold. 
Chill until firm. Unmold on serving tray, garnish with additional cherries, 
if desired.
