 Description : 
 This is a beautiful high protein, light spring soup. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  asparagus 
 5 cups  chicken stock , vegetable stock, or water 
 1 bulb  spring (green) garlic , separated into cloves if cloves have formed, peeled and thinly sliced 
 salt and freshly ground  pepper 
 4 large  eggs 
 ¼ cup freshly grated  pecorino  or  Parmesan cheese 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped  flat-leaf parsley 
 ½ cup  pasta  or  rice , cooked, or 4 to 6 slices toasted  Italian bread  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Break off the woody ends of the asparagus stalks and combine them with the stock or water and the garlic in a soup pot and bring to a simmer. Simmer 15 minutes. Using a skimmer, tongs, or a slotted spoon, remove the asparagus stems and discard. 
 Season the broth to taste with salt and pepper. Slice the asparagus into 1-inch pieces and add to the broth. Simmer 8 to 12 to minutes. It should be very tender and fragrant, but still bright green and not mushy. 
 Just before serving, beat the eggs, cheese, and parsley together in a bowl. Have the soup at a bare simmer. Making sure that the soup isn't boiling, whisk a ladleful into the egg mixture. Stir well and whisk back into the soup. Whisk constantly over very low heat for 3 minutes, then ladle into bowls and serve, with a spoonful of pasta or rice, or a slice of toast in each bowl if desired. 
 This soup must be served right away.
