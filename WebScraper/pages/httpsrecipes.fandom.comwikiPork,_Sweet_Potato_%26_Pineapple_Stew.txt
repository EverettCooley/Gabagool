 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 12 oz. pork tenderloin, trimmed of fat 
 4 cups water 
 2 small onions, halved and sliced 
 4 cloves garlic, whole, minced 
 3 black peppercorns 
 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil or corn oil 
 2 (28 oz.) cans whole tomatoes, drained and chopped 
 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks 
 1-1/2 tablespoon raisins 
 1 tablespoon sugar 
 1/2 teaspoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers or chili-garlic paste 
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 
 Pinch of ground cloves 
 1 cup diced fresh pineapple 
 8 green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 
 Directions : 
 Combine pork, water, halved onion, whole garlic, peppercorns and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer; cook, partially covered, over low heat until the pork is no longer pink inside, 30 to 40 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add sliced onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. 
 Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, minced garlic, tomatoes, sweet potato, raisins, sugar, adobo sauce (or chili-garlic paste), cinnamon, oregano and cloves. 
 Bring to a simmer; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potato is just tender, about 15 minutes. 
 Transfer the pork to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine sieve, reserving 3/4 cup. (Refrigerate or freeze extra broth for another use.) 
 Add the pork, 3/4 cup cooking liquid, pineapple and olives to the vegetable mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in cilantro.
