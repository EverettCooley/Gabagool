1/2 c White sugar
3 tb Cocoa
1/2 c Chopped nuts
1/2 c Milk

 Sift the first five ingredients together. Add the
nuts. Make a well in the centre and add milk, vanilla
and melted shortening. Stir lightly and pour batter
into a greased casserole. SAUCE: Measure cocoa, brown
sugar, hot water and orange rind into a bowl and beat
well. Pour over batter. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes at
