 Directions : 
 1. Make pastry: In food processor, combine  flour ,  Sugar ,  salt  and  baking powder  and pulse on/off until blended. Add  butter  and pulse on/off until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add 3 tablespoons  ice   water . Pulse on/off until mixture is evenly dampened. Sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons  water  and process until dough forms large crumbs and can be easily packed.
 
 2. Transfer dough to work surface and form into ball. Knead dough 2 or 3 times, then place on large sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten into 3/4-inch thick disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.
 
 3. Preheat oven to 400Ã»F. Meanwhile, make filling. Bring medium pot of lightly salted  water  to a boil. Add  potatoes ,  carrots ,  corn  and  Peas ; boil 5 minutes. Drain vegetables and transfer to medium bowl.
 
 4. In medium saucepan, melt 1 1/2 tablespoons  butter  over medium heat. Add  Onion  and  celery  and cook, stirring often, until  Onion  has softened, 8 to 9 minutes. Stir in  oil  and  flour  and cook over low heat, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in  vegetable broth . Increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Stir in  milk  and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 1 1/2 minutes. Pour sauce over vegetables and stir to mix well. Season with  thyme  and  salt  and  pepper  to taste.
 
 5. Transfer vegetables to 9 1/2- or 10-inch deep-dish pie pan; smooth top. Let cool 15 minutes. On a sheet of lightly floured wax paper, roll pastry into circle just slightly larger than pie pan. Invert pastry over pie pan and peel off paper. Tuck edges of pastry inside edge of pan; poke several steam vents in crust with knife. Bake until pastry is golden, 50 to 60 minutes.
