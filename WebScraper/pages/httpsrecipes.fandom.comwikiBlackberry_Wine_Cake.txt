This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Cline Estate in Dallas, Texas in 1993. My mother was so excited when I came across this recipe. It was one she remembered from the 1950s and has made several times since finding this recipe. It's very good and very addicting. Give this a shot for the New Years! It's excellent!
