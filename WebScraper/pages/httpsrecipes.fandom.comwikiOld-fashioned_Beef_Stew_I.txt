 Serves 6 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup  flour 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp freshly ground  pepper 
 2 lbs stewing  beef  plus bones 
 4 tbsp  shortening 
 4 cups boiling  water 
 1 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1 tbsp  Worcestershire sauce 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 1 large  onion , sliced 
 2  bay leaves 
 ½ tsp  allspice 
 12 small  carrots , trimmed and scraped 
 12 small  white onions , trimmed 
 8 small  new potatoes , peeled 
 Directions : 
 Mix the flour, salt, and pepper and roll the beef cubes in the mixture. 
 Shake off excess. 
 Melt the shortening over high heat in a dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with a cover. 
 When the fat is very hot add the beef, about 5 or 6 pieces at a them so as not to crowd them, brown on all sides, and remove. 
 When the last batch of meat is a richly dark color, return all to the pot and pour on the boiling water. 
 Stand back when you do, because it will spit and sputter. 
 Stir and add the lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, onion, bay leaves, and allspice. 
 Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 1½ to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. 
 Add the carrots, onions, and potatoes and cook another 20 – 25 minutes or until they can be pierced easily with a fork.
