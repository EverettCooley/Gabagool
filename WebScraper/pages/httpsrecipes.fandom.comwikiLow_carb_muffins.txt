 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 tbsp  vegetable oil 
 4  eggs 
 1/2 tsp  cream of tartar 
 1/4 cup low fat  cottage cheese 
 2 tbsp  soy flour 
 1 package artificial sweetener 
 Directions : 
 Preaheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat muffin cups with a little  vegetable oil . (or use  butter ,  margarine , or pan spray) Separate the  eggs  very carefully, allowing no  egg  yolk to mix with the whites. Beat the  egg  whites with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the  cream of tartar  and continue beating just until stiff peaks form. Combine  egg  yolks,  cottage cheese ,  soy flour , and sweetener. Fold this mixture carefully into the  egg  whites. Fill each muffin cup 2/3 full of batter. Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until the are golden brown and spring back when touched. Variation: to make spice muffins, stir ½ ts  cinnamon , ¼ ts  ground ginger , and 1/8 ts cloves into the  soy flour  before adding to the  egg  yolks. Note these turned out tasty but sort of fell like crumpets, i would be more careful about not overmixing next time
