 Description 
 The  sidecar  serves as the foundation for many of the most popular cocktails of the last century: the  Margarita , the  Daiquiri , the  Cosmopolitan , and the  Kamikaze , to name a few. The cocktail originated in Paris shortly after the first World War.
 The appellation of this cocktail is said to have come from its originator, who always traveled in a motorcycle sidecar. It consists of Brandy, orange-flavored Liqueur (such as Triple Sec) and lemon juice, shaken with ice and strained into a cocktail glass.

 Tips 
 David Embury, who claims to know the drink's inventor, suggests an 8:2:1 ratio. 
 Robert Hess suggests a ratio of 4:2:1, and insists on  Cognac  and  Cointreau . 
 In practice, most customers apparently expect a brandy-based Margarita. 
 Steve Jaffe offers a K.I.S.S. approach by simply exchanging the brandy and sugar rim for the tequila and salt rim in your favorite Margarita recipe to maintain a parallel flavor profile when introducing your Margarita drinkers to the Sidecar.
