 Ingredients : 
 1 ea  Pork  (pig) leg 
 1 ea average  Chicken 
 2 ea  bay leaves 
 5 ea  pepper   Peas 
 1 ea large  carrot 
 salt  to taste 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Clean the leg (we have a special name for this part of the pig, but I
couldn't find in English) very well. Pour hot  water  into the pan (2 l  water 
for every 1 kg meat). Put the leg and a  Chicken  into the pan and cook
during 4–5 hours on the little fire without boiling. 1 hour before
preparedness chop a  carrot  finely and add it,  pepper ,  salt ,  bay leaves  into
the pan. When the meat is detached freely from the bones, take it out of
the pan. Detach the meat and slice it. Strain the broth. Put meat and
 carrot  rounds on the dish (it must not be very large and very deep, use
some dishes for Studen). Pour the broth. Let Studen cool down and harden
in the fridge for a night.
Studen is served with  mustard , hot  ketchup .
