Ingredients : 
 2 Pears 
 2 Pretzel Twists 
 Candy Eyes 
 2 Cherries 
 Directions : 
 Cut the bottoms of the pears so they will sit on a plate without rolling around. 
 Make 2 holes on the sides using a knife. 
 Break the pretzel twists in half & press the halves in the holes on the pear. 
 Place on the edible eyes (use peanut butter if they will not stick). 
 Place a cherry on the tip for the nose….that’s it!
