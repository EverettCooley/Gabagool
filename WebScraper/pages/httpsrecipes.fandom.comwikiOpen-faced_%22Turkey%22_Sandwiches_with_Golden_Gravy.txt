Ingredients : 
 1 lb  extra-firm tofu , cut horizontally in half 
 1 cup  mushroom broth   or  soaking liquid from dried  shiitake mushrooms 
 ½ cup reduced-sodium  soy sauce 
 2 Tbsp  vegetable oil 
 1 Tbsp  brown rice vinegar 
 1 Tbsp finely shredded  fresh ginger 
 2 large cloves  garlic , minced 
 1¼ cups  Golden Gravy 
 4 slices  bread  (preferably whole-grain), lightly toasted 
 mashed  potatoes  and jellied  cranberry sauce  for serving (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Cover cutting board with piece of plastic wrap and place  tofu  halves side-by-side on top of plastic. Cover with second piece of plastic, then second cutting board. Weight down with large cans of  tomatoes  or a cast-iron skillet. Let stand 1 hour to compact texture and press out  water . 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. In small saucepan, boil broth until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce,  oil ,  vinegar ,  ginger  and  garlic . 
 Arrange  pressed tofu  to cover bottom of 9 x 5-inch loaf pan; pour warm broth mixture on top. Bake, uncovered, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer pan to a wire rack and cool completely in liquid. 
 With slotted spatula, transfer  tofu  to plastic container; discard liquid. Cover and refrigerate thoroughly to firm texture, at least 4 hours or overnight. 
 To serve, thinly slice  tofu  lengthwise, holding knife at 45° angle. Place  tofu  slices in large saucepan, add gravy and warm through over low heat. Place slice of toast on each plate. Arrange several  tofu  slices on top; spoon gravy over. Serve hot, with mashed  potatoes  and  cranberry sauce  if desired.
