 Ingredients : 
 14 oz / 400 g plain  flour 
 8 oz / 225 g unsalted  butter 
 4 oz / 125 g  icing sugar  sieved 
 pinch  salt 
 2 tbsp / 30 ml grated  lemon   rind 
 4  egg yolks 
 4 tbsp / 60 ml dry  white wine 
 Filling : 
 4  egg yolks 
 10 tbsp / 150 ml  sour cream 
 2½ lb / 1.1 kg  ricotta  or  cream cheese  sieved 
 2 oz / 50 g melted  butter 
 12 oz / 350 g  caster sugar 
 grated rind of 1  orange 
 6 oz / 175 g fresh  candied  peel 
 6 oz / 175 g  sultanas 
 sieved  icing sugar 
 Directions : 
 Sieve the  flour . Roughly chop  butter  and place in a bow with  Sugar ,  salt ,  flour  and  lemon  rind. Using hands, rub ingredients together until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. 
 Add the  egg yolks  and the wine to the mixture. Using a fork or a knife, gently work the ingredients until they begin to bind together. If the mixture' is too wet, add another tablespoon of  flour 
 Using one hand with a little  flour  on it, gently form the mixture into a dough. knead it lightly to form a ball. Wrap the dough in grease proof paper or oiled foil and place in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to Mark 4 / 350 °F / 180 °C 
 Using an electric beater or wooden spoon beat the  egg yolks ,  sour cream , ricotta or  cream cheese , but ter and  caster sugar  lightly together until smooth. 
 Mix together the  orange  rind , mixed peel and sultanas. Gradually add the dried fruit to the  Cheese  mix ture and, using a large metal spoon, mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of the fruit. 
 Take out chilled dough and carefully roll out on a floured surface. Roll pastry round the rolling pin and gently lay it in the tin. Using your knuckles press the pastry well to the sides of the tin so that it fits snugly. 
 Using a sharp knife, trim away the excess pastry hanging over the edge of the tin. Smooth the edge. 
 Gather up the excess pastry. Lightly knead it again and re-roll into a rectangular shape. Cut it into long thin strips. Prick the base of the pastry case. 
 Spoon the creamy  cheese  filling into the pastry case and, using the back of the spoon, smooth the surface. Arrange the pastry strips across each other in an even lattice design on top of the cheesecake (see photo-graph above). 
 Trim the pastry strips. Seal to the edge of the pasty case with a little  water . Bake in the middle of the oven for 1 – 1½ hours until golden and the top of the cheesecake feels firm. If it's  browning  too quickly, cover with foil. 
 The cheeseake will not feel totally firm when it is removed from the oven. Allow it to cool, then place it still in the tin in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. During this time the  cheese  will set and become firm to the touch. Carefully remove the cheesecake from tin and serve it lightly sprinkled with sieved  icing sugar .
