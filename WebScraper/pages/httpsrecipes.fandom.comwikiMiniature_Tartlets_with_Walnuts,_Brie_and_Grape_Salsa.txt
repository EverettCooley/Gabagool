 .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup seedless  Red Grapes , halved 
 1/4 tsp. coarse (kosher)  salt 
 2 Tbs. finely chopped  scallion  (green part only) 
 1 Tbs.  balsamic vinegar 
 2 tsp.  walnut oil 
 1/4 tsp. chopped fresh  rosemary 
 1/4 tsp. minced  garlic 
 1/8 tsp. freshly ground  pepper 
 48 miniature  savory  pastry shells (1 1/2-inch diameter) 
 1/2 cup  walnuts , finely chopped and toasted 
 8 oz.  Brie , rind removed 
 Directions : 
 1. Preheat oven to 300F. In food pro-cessor, combine  grapes  and  salt  and pulse until  grapes  are coarsely chopped. Transfer to fine-mesh sieve and let stand at least 10 minutes to drain.
 
 2. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix to-gether  scallion ,  vinegar ,  oil ,  rosemary ,  garlic  and  pepper . Add chopped  grapes  and mix well.
 
 3. To assemble, place pastry shells on baking sheet and fill each with 1/2 teaspoon  walnuts , 1/2 teaspoon  Brie  and 1/2 teaspoon  grape  salsa (use fork to add salsa to avoid getting too much liquid). Bake just until  Brie  begins to melt, about 5 minutes. Do not overbake. Serve immediately.
 
 Do ahead: The  grape  salsa can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated, but do not add  walnut oil  until ready to assemble. The tarts can be partially as-sembled with the  walnuts  and  Brie  up to 6 hours in advance. Add salsa up to 30 minutes ahead. Bake as directed.
