Description : 
 Who says vegetables and hot pepper are expensive for affordable cooking? This countrified bread-based dish is great for appetizers or side dishes and delivers a crisp aroma with the bread, vegetables, and spices but authentic salsa occasionally works for this, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 12 slices from a long loaf of crusty  French bread 
 3 tbsp.  olive oil 
 1 ½ tbsp. fresh  lime juice 
 1 tbsp. minced  cilantro 
 ½ cup chopped  plum tomatoes 
 ½ cup frozen  corn , thawed 
 ½ cup minced  green peppers  (bell, Jalapeño, or piri-piri), deseeded if desired 
 2  garlic  cloves, minced 
 6 – 10 drops  hot pepper sauce 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 375° F. 
 Brush each slice of bread with the oil and toast the bread slices on a cookie sheet in the oven for 5 minutes. 
 Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and top each slice of bread with the bruschetta. Serve hot and plain.
