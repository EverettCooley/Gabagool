 Fleischmann's developed active dry yeast, which did not require refrigeration. The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down on baking time. This is the yeast called for by most bread recipes. It's largely displaced the  fresh yeast  our grandparents used since it has a longer shelf life and is more tolerant of mishandling. Look for it in the dairy case. It is usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars. Always check the expiration date to make sure the yeast is fresh.
 Equivalents : One package = 2¼ teaspoons = ¼ ounce 
 To activate it, sprinkle it on water that's 105 °F - 115 °F and wait for it to begin foaming (about five minutes).
 Substitutes : 
 
 Fresh yeast  – Substitute one cake for each package or 2¼ teaspoons of active dry yeast. 
 Instant yeast  – Substitute measure for measure, but don't dissolve it in liquid first. Your bread will only need to rise once. 
 Bread machine yeast  – Substitute measure for measure, but don't dissolve it in liquid first. Your bread will only need to rise once. 
 Storage : 
 Dry yeast can be stored at room temperature until the expiration date, or within 4 months of opening, but it lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer. Always bring yeast to room temperature before you use it. It's important to keep stored yeast away from air and moisture, so use the smallest container you can find and seal it well.
