These delicate little pancakes make a tasty smoked salmon starter for a dinner party or gorgeous canapes if you're just putting on drinks for family and friends. The key to getting the authentic taste is the buckwheat flour, this rich savoury ingredient balances with smoky salmon perfectly.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For the blinis : 
 100g (4oz) buckwheat flour, sifted 
 125g (4½oz) strong white flour, sifted 
 1 tsp fine salt 
 6g (0.2 oz) yeast 
 2 eggs, separated 
 425ml (14.5 fl oz) buttermilk 
 For the topping : 
 150g (5oz) smoked salmon slices 
 1 x 250ml tub crème fraîche 
 4 tbsp lumpfish roe caviare 
 Fresh chives, snipped, for presentation 
 Directions : 
 To make the blinis, place flours, salt, yeast and egg yolks into a large bowl. Whisk in the buttermilk until you have a smooth batter. Cover with clingfilm and leave for 2 hours or until frothy and "proved". 
 Whisk the egg whites to form stiff peaks and gently fold into the batter. 
 Lightly oil a heavy non-stick frying pan or skillet and pour a tablespoonful of the batter into the hot pan. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes on each side and repeat with the rest of the batter. 
 Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and store the blinis in the fridge. Before serving, warm them for 10 minutes in a low oven. 
 To serve, top the blinis with either a small slice of smoked salmon and a dollop of crème fraîche, or crème fraîche topped with caviar and a sprinkling of black pepper and decorate with snipped chives.
