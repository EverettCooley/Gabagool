The griddling process cooks foods with a high heat source, either directly, indirectly, or with a combination of both. It is essentially the same technique as broiling except that when griddling, the food is cooked above the heat source and with broiling; the food is cooked below the heat source. Griddling temperatures typically reach as high as 650 °F, but any temperature above 300 °F is suitable as a griddling temperature. The high heat of griddling sears the surface of lamb, creating tender meat with a flavorful crust. The required cooking temperature and the method of griddling depends on the cut of lamb and the quality of the meat. As with any cooking method, lamb that is grilled should not be overcooked in order to produce the best results. There are a wide range of grills available that are suitable for griddling various cuts of lamb. Some grills are designed for indoor use and provide convenience for consumers who are unable to grill outdoors due to location or climate. Grills designed for outdoor use provide a flavor to food that is difficult to match with indoor griddling.
