Crunchy Munchies Hot, fried snacks are perfect for rainy afternoons. Here are some recipes that combine the traditional and the modern.
 
  There are few greater pleasures during the rains than munching on some mouth-watering fried starters and sipping hot cups of chai. Here are a few palate-tickling concoctions by gourmet chef John Rodrigues of the Sea Shells Restaurant at the Lotus Heritage in Salcete, Goa, owned by the Vithal Kamat group. You don�t have to go all the way to Goa to enjoy these crunchy delights!
 CHEESE/PANEER FINGERS  With a crisp and golden crust and stuffing that melts in your mouth, these take you to a different culinary plane.

 Paneer or cheese 250 gm
Gram flour (besan) 200 gm
Carom seeds (ajwain) � tsp
Chilli powder � tsp
Cooking soda a pinch
Turmeric powder (haldi) a pinch
Salt to taste
Oil for frying
 
  Method:
 Cut paneer or cheese into one-inch long fingers. Heat oil in a deep-bottomed pan (kadai), reducing the flame when it�s piping hot. Dip cheese/paneer pieces into the batter and put them in the hot oil one by one. Fry till golden brown. Serve hot with mint chutney or tomato ketchup.
 BATATA VADA  An all-time and all-season favourite, perfect with chutney or tomato ketchup. For a more filling snack, slip it inside a pau with the traditional garlic-red chilli powder.
 Ingredients:
 Boiled potatoes 6 large
 
 Chopped onions 2 large
Chopped green chilli 2
Chopped ginger 1 inch
Curry leaves

 Mash potatoes and add the rest of the ingredients except the mustard seeds and curry leaves. Heat two teaspoons of oil, add mustard seeds and curry leaves, put them into the potato mixture when they begin to splutter and mix well. Make large, lemon-sized balls of the mashed potatoes.
 Heat oil in a deep-bottomed pan. Dip the potato balls in the batter and gently put them into the hot oil one by one, removing when crisp and golden yellow. Serve hot with green chutney or sauce and masala chai.
