 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 (16 	ounce) cans whole-berry berry sauce 
 2 (20 	ounce) cans crushed  pineapple 
 1 	cup crushed  pecans  (or other favorite nut) 
 2 	medium sized  Apples  (unpeeled) 
 Directions : 
 Strain the liquid from both cans of crushed  pineapple . Good tipâ€”put the  pineapple  into a fine mesh sieve and press it down with the bottom of a bowl. Make sure you have most of the juice removed. 
 In a large mixing bowl put both cans of strained pineapple & both cans of berry sauce. 
 Add 1 cup of crushed  pecans . Add more or less (or none) depending on taste. 
 Core and dice two medium sized  Apples . Using a firmer  Apple , helps it keep its consistency. 
 Mix all ingredients together, making sure you have no "clumps" of berry sauce. Chill and serve.
