 Ingredients : 
 1 pound lean bottom round or  sirloin , in one piece 6 inches in diameter 
 2 stalks fresh  lemon grass  or 2 tablespoons dri grass 
 2 small  red chile peppers , seeded 
 2½ tablespoons  sugar  or  honey 
 1 tablespoon nuoc mam (Vietnamese  fish sauce ) 
 3 tablespoons  light soy sauce 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  beef  across the  grain  onto very thin 3 by 3 inch slices. 
 If you are using fresh  lemon grass , discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk. 
 Cut into thin slices and finely chop. 
 If you are using dried  lemon grass , soak in warm  water  for 1 hour. 
 Drain and finely chop. 
 Combine the chiles and  sugar  in a mortar and pestle and pound to a fine paste. 
 Add the chopped  lemon grass , sauce and soy sauce and stir to blend (if using a blender, combine all of these and blend to a very fine paste) 
 Spread the paste over the  beef  pieces to coat both sides. 
 Let marinate for 30 minutes. 
 Spread out each slice of marinated  beef  on a large, flat wire rack or baking sheet. 
 Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely dried, about 12 hours (you can also place a rack on a jelly roll pan and let the  beef  dry in the refrigerator for 2 days) 
 Grill the  beef  over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400 °F oven and bake until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. 
 Serve with  glutinous rice .
