Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 block extra  firm tofu 
 juice of 2  lemons 
 ¼ cup  orange juice 
 2 tbsp  maple syrup 
 2 tbsp mango or other  fruit vinegar 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 1½ tsp  rosemary 
 2 cloves  garlic  (crushed) 
 1½ tsp  soy sauce 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 fresh ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk together. 
 Cut  tofu  into 1" thick slices and place in a flat dish. 
 Pour the marinade over the  tofu . 
 Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, turning the  tofu  every now and then to make sure it is covered with marinade. 
 Turn the BBQ on medium. Tofu tends to stick to the grill, so brush with some  olive oil  before placing on the BBQ. Brush with extra marinade while the  tofu  is cooking. 
 Flip the  tofu  when it starts to get grill marks on the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
 Brush the top with  olive oil  before flipping. 
 Cook until the other side has grill marks. 
 Serve immediately.
