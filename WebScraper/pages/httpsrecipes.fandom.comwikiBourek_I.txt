Description : 
 Beef-stuffed pastry rolls
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 1  egg , beaten 
 1 small  onion , chopped (¼ cup) 
 2 tbsp  flat leaf parsley , chopped 
 ½ lb  ground beef 
 6  phyllo  sheets, 12x17" each 
 ½ tsp  salt  or to taste 
 lemon  wedges for serving 
 ¼ tsp  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Heat 1 tablespoon of the  oil  in a skillet, add the  onion  and stir-fry over moderate heat for 2 minutes. 
 Add the  beef ,  salt  and  pepper  and stir-fry for 5 minutes. 
 Then add the  egg  and  parsley  and fry for 1 minute more. 
 Cool well. 
 Take 1  phyllo  sheet and spread it out flat with a short end nearest you. 
 Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the  beef  mixture 2 inches in from the short edge. 
 Fold both long sides in toward the middle, beginning with the short end roll the  phyllo  to shape a packet 4 inches long and 1½ inches wide. 
 Repeat with all the remaining  phyllo  sheets and stuffing. 
 Set aside. 
 Put the balance of the  oil  in a skillet over moderate/low heat and add the rolls. 
 Brown on both sides for about 3 minutes; the low heat prevents the very thin pastry sheets from burning. 
 Drain the rolls on paper towels for a minute. 
 Serve warm with a squeeze of  lemon  juice.
