Ingredients : 
 2 measure  cream of tartar 
 1 measure  baking soda 
 Directions : 
 Mix together and use immediately. 
 If you want to mix ahead of time and store no longer than one month, add 1 measure  cornstarch  note: i use teaspoons for measure amount, but it really depends on how much you need. 
 The  cornstarch  will help keep the other ingredients from absorbing moisture (this is what is used in manufactured  baking powder ). 
 If you have a recipe that calls for double acting  baking powder , just use twice the amount. 
 Oh, one more thing, to check and see if the  baking powder  in your pantry is still active, stir 1 teaspoon into one-third cup hot  water . 
 There should be immediate vigorous bubbling. 
 If no bubbling or bubbling is sporadic, the  baking powder  is past its prime. 
 Homemade  baking powder  starts to fizz and release carbon dioxide the minute it is added to liquid, it is very important that the oven be preheated and baking pans be ready before mixing batter. 
 Mix quickly and put in oven right away.
