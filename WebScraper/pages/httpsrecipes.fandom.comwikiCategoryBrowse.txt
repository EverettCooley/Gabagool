This is our top-level category. (Looking at it another way, it is our root category!)
 Ideally, every other category should be a subcategory of at least one other, and every article should be in at least one category; many will fit well into two (eg location and subject-matter). A full list of existing categories can be found at  Special:Categories .
 
To add a new category, just add [[category:categoryname]] to the article or existing category page (after checking whether any existing category is suitable). From  Recipes Wiki , a  Wikia  wiki.
