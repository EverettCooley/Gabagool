Description : 
       Jiaozi - Wanton of the North     
 The wanton of the North. Different filling, different taste, but the idea is the same ... a combination of meat or vegetables wrapped with a thin sheet of dough. The Northerners loves it, the Taiwanese love it and it's popular overseas usually served as a dim sum while in Japan it's called gyoza. 
 There are many specialised jiaozi restaurants both in China and Taiwan. Shanghai is famous for its Jiazi yet it doesn't quite suit foreigners taste for the simple reason that it's always much too oily, but the locals seem to like it. In most cases it's best served boiled. Shredded  ginger  in  vinegar / soy sauce  is often served as a dip sauce. 
 Not particularly Southeast Asian, this popular Chinese dish is available in many Chinese restaurants in the region and it's becoming a rather popular snack.
