Ingredients : 
 2 cups  Black-Eyed Peas , soaked in  water  overnight or for at least 4 hours 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 large  Onion 
 pepper  to taste 
 1 large  tomato , peeled 
 1 teaspoon  powdered ginger 
 1/2 cup  water 
 1  egg , lightly beaten (optional) 
 2 tablespoons  flour  (optional) 
 Enough cooking  oil  for deep-frying 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Rub soaked beans with fingertips to loosen and remove husks, then wash in a bowl of water. Repeat this several times until husks and all black eyes are discarded. In a blender, grind beans until very smooth, then add remaining vegetables and water. Grind all together with flour (if used) until well blended and a smooth batter is obtained. Pour into a bowl and set aside, covered, for 30 minutes. Stir in salt, pepper, ginger, and egg. Heat oil and deep-fry spoonfuls of mixture until all sides are golden brown. (To form smooth shapes, dip spoon into  water  each time before spooning out dough. Also, do not splash, but ease dough gently into the heated  oil .) Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
