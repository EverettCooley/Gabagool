 Wikipedia Article  About Orange Bitters on Wikipedia 
 Orange bitters are made from the rinds of unripe oranges. They are called for in some older cocktail recipes.
 Medicinal quantities of quinine were occasionally used in old cocktail recipes. Quinine is still found in much lower concentrations in tonic water, used today mostly in drinks with gin.
