 Ingredients : 
 Pastry 
 4 cups of flour (1 lb) 
 A pinch of salt 
 1 oz of fresh yeast or 1 tbsp of dry yeast 
 2 oz of butter 
 6 cup of sugar 
 3 cup of milk 
 5 egg

 3.5 oz of churned butter 
 .   8 cup of sugar (3.5 oz) 
 
 3 tbsp of warm milk 
 4 cup of peeled and sliced almonds 
 Preparation : 
 Sift the flour along with the salt and place it in a bowl. Add the butter mashing with a fork until it integrates. Add the shredded yeast and sugar.
 Mix the milk with the egg and add it mixing until it is incorporated. According to the dough's density, more milk will be added or not. Work with your hands until everything is bound and turn over onto a table. Knead the pastry until achieving a smooth, elastic texture. It should not stick to your hands or table.
 Place it in a large bowl to leaven. Cover the container with plastic or saran wrap and then with a cloth. Let it sit for 30 minutes or until it has leavened. The time it takes to leaven will depend on the room temperature. Grease and dust a rectangular mold and pour the preparation in it. Let it sit while you prepare the covering.
 Coating. Place the sugar, milk and butter in a saucepan. Place over flame, always stirring, until everything is bound. Then add the chopped almonds and stir well. Remove and continue mixing to cool the preparation. Pour on the dough and spread the almonds throughout the surface. Place in the oven at 360Â° F for 30 minutes or until it is cooked.
 It can be served warm or cold, alone or with a scoop of whipped cream without sugar.
