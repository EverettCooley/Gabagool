Description : 
 From  Cooking Light  (May 2005). They suggest filling these with a mixture of berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries), but I think this would be even better with some cooked apples or pears. This needs time to chill. 
 
 30 minutes | 10 minutes prep 
 8 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup  flour 
 ¾ cup  half-and-half 
 ¼ cup whole  milk 
 ¼ cup  granulated sugar 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 ¼ teaspoon  vanilla extract 
 1 dash  salt 
 2  eggs 
 cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Combine flour and next 7 ingredients (through eggs) in a food processor, and process until smooth. 
 Pour batter into a bowl; cover and chill for at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours. 
 Heat an 8-inch crêpe pan or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
 Coat pan with cooking spray; remove pan from heat. 
 Pour a scant ¼ cup batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all directions so batter covers pan with a thin film. 
 Cook 1 minute or until surface of crêpe begins to look dry. 
 Carefully lift edge of crêpe with a spatula to test for doneness. 
 Turn crêpe over when it can be shaken loose from pan and the underside is lightly browned; cook crêpe 20 seconds on the other side. 
 Place crêpe on a towel, and cool. 
 Repeat the procedure until all of the batter is used, for a total of eight crêpes. 
 Stack the crêpes between single layers of wax paper or paper towels to prevent them from sticking. 
 These can be refrigerated for 5 days or frozen for a month.
