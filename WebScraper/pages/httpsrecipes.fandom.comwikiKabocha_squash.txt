 About Kabocha squash : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Kabocha squash on Wikipedia 
 Kabocha (南瓜, かぼちゃ, literally "southern melon") is a Japanese squash. The word kabocha has come to mean a general type of winter squash to English speaking growers and buyers.
 Varieties include: Ajihei, Ajehei No. 107, Ajihei No. 331, Ajihei No. 335, Cutie, Ebisu, Emiguri, and Miyako.
 Kabocha is commonly called "Japanese pumpkin", especially in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia, and "kabocha squash" in North America. In Japan, the word kabocha may refer to either the squash discussed in this article or to the Western-style pumpkin.
 Kabocha is hard, shaped like a squatty pumpkin, it is has a dull colored deep green skin with some celadon-to white-colored stripes, intense yellow-orange color on the inside.
 Rich in beta carotene, with iron, vitamin C, potassium, and smaller traces of calcium, folic acid, and minute amounts of B vitamins.
 It has an exceptional naturally sweet flavor, even sweeter than butternut squash. Similar in texture and flavor to a pumpkin and a sweet potato combined together. Some can taste like a Russet potato. Like other squash-family members it is commonly mixed in side dishes and soups, or anywhere pumpkin, potato, or other squash's would be. Available all year round, but best late summer, and early fall. Normally weighing two-to-three pounds.
 Primarily grown in Japan, California, Florida, Tasmania, Hawke's Bay New Zealand, Southwestern Colorado, Mexico, Chile, and South Africa. Most of the California, Colorado and New Zealand crop is exported to Japan.
