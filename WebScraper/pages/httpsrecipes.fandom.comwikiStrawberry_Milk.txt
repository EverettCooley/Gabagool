Ingredients : 
 Strawberries 
 Sugar 
 Milk 
 Instructions : 
 Place the strawberries, sugar, and water in a saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and juicy. 
 Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and pour the strawberry mixture through the strainer. Use the back of a spoon to press the strawberries against the strainer, extracting as much juice/syrup as possible. Chill the syrup. You can either discard the solids or save them for topping oatmeal or yogurt. 
 To serve: pour 1 cup of milk and add syrup to taste (I add between 3-4 tablespoons of syrup per cup of milk). Stir and serve.
