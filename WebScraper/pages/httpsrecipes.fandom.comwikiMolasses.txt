 Wikipedia Article  About Molasses on Wikipedia 
 Molasses or treacle is a thick, syrupy derivative of the juice of the sugarcane plant or the processing of sugar beet. The word molasses comes from the Portuguese word mela√ßo. The quality of molasses depends on the maturity of the sugar cane or beet, the amount of sugar extracted, and the method of extraction.
