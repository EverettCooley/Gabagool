Description : 
 The Dutch recipe for pancakes. Please note that in the Netherlands pancakes are both eaten as a meal, and as a dessert. Dutch pancakes are lighter to the stomach than American pancakes, allowing you to eat more. Eventhough they have more surface area, in the end they contain less volume. They are a favourite at children's parties and there are specialist "Pancake Restaurants" that serve wagon wheel size pancakes with a variety of fillings, including savoury ones.
