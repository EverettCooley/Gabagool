Ingredients : 
 12 ounces  green tomatoes  or  tomatillos , chopped 
 2 large  onions , chopped 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 2 cups  apple cider vinegar 
 3 cups  sugar 
 1 teaspoon ground  nutmeg 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 Â½ teaspoon ground  cloves 
 1  chili pepper , sliced, to your taste 
 Directions : 
 Place the chopped vegetables in a large pot. 
 Add the  Sugar ,  vinegar ,  salt  and spices. Stir well. 
 Heat the mixture, stirring, until the  Sugar  has just about melted, then bring to the boil. 
 Stir well, reduce heat a little, and simmer, uncovered, until the mixture is thick. This will take about an hour. Towards the end of cooking, add the  chilli . 
 If your chutney doesn't thicken as it should, drain off the extra liquid. (This could all depend on the type of  tomato ). 
 Cool, then refrigerate. The chutney will thicken as it cools. Presumably it will freeze okay. 
 I would pour the mixture into hot, sterilised bottles and seal them.
