 Broth 
 For the  beef broth , you can simply heat up some  Beef  consommé, use a bouillon cube dissolved in boiling  water , or make a good homemade broth by simmering a large piece of shoulder (with bones) with  onions  and  carrots  for 3–4 hours; strain; season with  salt  and  pepper ; add the  red wine  and boil again. The broth can be made a day ahead.
