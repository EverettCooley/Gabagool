 About Delicata squash : 
 The delicata squash is also called the sweet potato squash, although it differs in appearance: the delicata squash has a light yellow skin and it is striped with green or brown lines. The taste of this plant is similar to sweet potatoes` taste, but it has a more creamy texture. The size of the delicata squash varies from 5 to 9 inches in length and the form is rather long and oval. The most important nutrients of this squash are the A and C vitamins and the iron and potassium. The best delicata squash pieces are the ones that are heavy, very firm and without any soft spots on their surface – like this, they can be prepared in various ways and keep their special taste. 
 Delicata squash can be used in various recipes as entree, main course and dessert and the most famous one is the roast delicata squash salad. The roasted delicata squash salad consists of olive oil, black pepper, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, mixed greens, dried cranberries, pine toasted nuts and the delicata squash slices.
 Also called sweet potato squash, the delicata squash has a pale yellow skin with medium green striations. Inside, the succulent yellow flesh tastes like a cross between sweet potatoes and butternut squash. The oblong delicata can range from 5 to 9 inches in length and 1½ to 3 inches in diameter.
