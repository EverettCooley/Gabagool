 Finger painting 
 
 For young children, prepare instant  chocolate  pudding and let them do creative finger painting with no danger if some finds its way to their mouths! 
 Macaroni  pictures 
 
 Have various shapes of  Pasta  to choose from. 
 Let children glue these onto colored paper for creative pictures. 
 Place mats 
 
 Let children draw their own pictures on fairly heavy paper. 
 Use clear contact paper to cover the front and back of the drawing. 
 They now have their own personal placemat. 
 These make fun presents for mom and dad for special occasions.
