Onion soup with milk, buttermilk and crushed wheat.
 Take 2 kilos of diced white onions, and braise them in a pot (should fill one quarter) with a little water until it all melts. Add two sticks of butter, milk, and butter milk until the pot is filled, and add maybe one to two cups of Jareesh (crushed wheat). Add a little salt, cumin, and lemonjuice, stir well, and heat it until it simmers (but not boils). Cook as such for a few hours until the Jareesh has softened, but take care it does not fully melt. You will want to stir a few times and hour and check that it does not overcook. When it Jareesh reach the semimelted point the dish is ready. Adjust the taste with lemon and salt as needed (should taste a little sour and salty). Garnish with a good amount of ghee, and optionally white onions sauteed in butter with cumin and pepper.
