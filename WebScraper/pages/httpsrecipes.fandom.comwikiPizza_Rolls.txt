Ingredients : 
 Pizza dough (I use store-bought ones to make 6 large rolls; use as much as use one depending on the size and number of rolls you want to make) 
 4 tbsp  pizza sauce 
 1  green bell pepper , diced 
 1 tsp dried  oregano 
 ½2 grated  mozzarella  cheese 
 Directions : 
 Spread out the pizza dough to form a rectangular shape. 
 Mix pizza sauce with diced  bell peppers  and spread evenly on the dough. Tightly roll up the dough and cut into 1-inch thick pieces. 
 Lay down each piece flat on a baking sheet, and sprinkle dried  oregano  and  mozzarella   Cheese  on top. 
 Bake till dough is cooked through and  Cheese  starts to brown.
