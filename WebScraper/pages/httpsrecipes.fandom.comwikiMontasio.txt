      Montasio     
 An Italian cheese traditionally produced as a farmhouse or creamery cheese, which was originally made from sheep's milk. Today, this cheese is produced from two milkings of cow's milk. The first milking in the evening is partially skimmed to remove the cream before being mixed with milk from the morning milking. The removed cream becomes  mascarpone , a spreadable mixture of cream used to flavor desserts and savory dishes.
 Canadian versions of this cheese are marketed as  Friulano .
