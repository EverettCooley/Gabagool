 Wikipedia Article  About Red chile powder on Wikipedia 
 Chile powder is the ground, dried fruit of one or more varieties of chile pepper, most commonly red pepper or  cayenne pepper , both of the species Capsicum Annuum. It is typically used as a spice to add heat or bite to dishes.
 Chile powder is often confused with  chili powder , a spice mix containing cumin, ground chile peppers, and other ingredients. Chili powder is typically used to flavor the popular Southwest United States dish commonly known as chili. While the two are pronounced the same, they impart quite a different flavoring to food and mixing them up has been the ruin of more than one dish.
 Chile powder is also known as ground/powdered red pepper or sometimes by the specific variety of chile pepper used.
