 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb Small-curd  cottage cheese , or  farmer cheese 
 4 tbl  yogurt 
 1 tbl  lemon  rind, grated 
 1 tbl Salad herbs 
 2 tbl Chopped  parsley 
 1 tbl  salt 
 1/4 tsp  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Yield: 1 quart 
 Combine all ingredients in 1 quart bowl. 
 The mixture should be moist enough to spoon but dry enough to stay firm when served. Drain off excess liquid. One or two heaping tablespoons of lab is placed on the injera before each guest. 
 NOTES : IAB is a white cured  Cheese  very much like the greek  feta . Special herbs are added(and sometimes chopped vegetables)which gives it its characteristically acid taste. Since the  Cheese  used in Ethiopia is not avaialble here, this recipe is an attempt to simulate lab.
