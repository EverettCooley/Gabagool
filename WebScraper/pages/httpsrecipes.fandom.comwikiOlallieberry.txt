 About Olallieberry : 
 This plant represents a cross between loganberry and youngberry, combination which was made in 1935 by George F. Waldo. Olallieberries are very popular as ingredients for different pies in Southern California. The fruit is shiny black and it resembles a classic blackberry, but the olallieberry is almost two-thirds blackberry and one-third European red raspberry. Olallieberries are very healthy, especially if they are eaten fresh, being relatively high in chlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid and phenolics, and high in fiber, a fact that reduces the risk of certain cancers.
