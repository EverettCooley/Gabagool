Lamb loin chops contain part of the backbone. Muscles include the eye of the loin, separated from the tenderloin by T-shaped finger bones, and the flank. Kidney fat is on the top of the tenderloin, and the outer surface is covered with fat, but with the fell removed. Lamb loin chops are usually prepared by broiling, griddling, pan-broiling, or pan-frying. Lamb loin chops are a lamb lean and tender cut of meat for an entree to serve to the elite and to have a tasty meal. In a small bowl, combine thyme, oregano, rosemary and parsley; set aside.
 Score the fat sides of the lamb loins to prevent curling and season with salt and pepper. In a medium sized frying pan over medium high heat, sauté lamb loins in olive oil on both sides to sear. Place loins in a shallow pan and roast in the oven for ten minutes; take out from oven. Coat lamb loins generously with mustard.  Apply herb mixture to loins and return chops to the oven and bake for an additional two minutes, or according to your preference. Remove from oven.
 In the meantime, steam the green beans to an al dente stage, remove from heat, drain. Toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet on medium heat; add the olive oil and the garlic, sauté until color appears.  Take away from heat, put in the beans and pitch in the oil with the garlic and serve.
