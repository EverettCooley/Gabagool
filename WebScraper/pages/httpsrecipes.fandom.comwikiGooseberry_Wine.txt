Ingredients : 
 3,8 liters of  water 
 1,4 kilo  sugar  or 1,36 kilo mild  honey 
 1,36 kilo  gooseberries 
 1 teaspoon  yeast  nutrient 
 1 crushed  Campden tablet 
 0,5 teaspoon pectic enzyme 
 1 sachet  champagne yeast 
 Directions : 
 Boil the  water  with the  sugar  or honey and if necessary skim it. 
 Take the stems of the  berries  (you can leave the tails though), put them in a straining bag and crush them with clean hands or a sterilized  potato  masher. 
 Be careful to only pick  berries  that still look good,  berries  gone bad can make the taste of the wine go moldy. 
 Pour the hot  water  over the crushed  berries  (leaving the  berries  in the bag). 
 Add the  yeast  nutrient and wait for it to cool down to add the Campden tablet. 
 Cover and fit with an airlock. 
 Twelve hours after you added the Campden tablet, add the pectic enzyme. 
 Cover and fit the airlock again. 
 Wait another twelve hours and then add the  yeast . 
 Stir down daily. 
 After one week, remove the bag (look out not to squeeze). 
 After the sediment has settled down again, rack the wine into a demijohn. 
 Bung and fit with an airlock. 
 Rack the wine once or twice during this secondary fermentation. 
 After about four to six months, taste the wine. 
 If it's too dry for you add 57 to 170 gram of  sugar  boiled in  water . 
 The wine will be drinkable in about a year.
