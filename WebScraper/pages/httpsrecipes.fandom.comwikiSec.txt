This French word literally means dry and when used to describe still (non-bubbly) wines, indicates that the wine has little if any residual sugar left after fermentation, meaning the wine is dry (not sweet). In sparkling wines such as Champagne, however, the word takes on quite another meaning: sec indicates a relatively sweet wine (Demi-Sec even sweeter), while the driest sparkling wines are referred to as Brut.
