 Description : 
 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 30 g / 1 oz refined  agar-agar  strands 
 1 bundle flowering  garlic chives 
 3  eggs 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 1 tablespoon  peanut oil 
 250 g / 8 oz fresh  bean sprouts 
 Dressing : 
 1 clove  garlic 
 1 teaspoon  sugar 
 3 tablespoons  light soy sauce 
 2 tablespoons Oriental  sesame oil 
 2 teaspoons  honey 
 Directions : 
 Soak  agar-agar  strands in cold  water  for 30 minutes to one hour while preparing the rest of the salad. 
 Wash the flowering  chives  and snap off any tough lower ends. 
 Finely chop some of the stalks to yield about 3 tablespoons. 
 Cut the rest of the  chives  into bite-sized lengths and drop into boiling  water  for 30 seconds, then drain and immerse in iced  water  to set the colour. 
 Drain as soon as they are cold. 
 Beat the  eggs , season with  salt  and  pepper  and stir in chopped  chives . 
 Heat a heavy frying pan and cook just enough  egg  mixture to coat the pan with a thin layer. 
 When set but not browned turn  egg  sheet onto a plate and rub pan lightly with  oil  before making another. 
 Continue until all the  egg  is used up. 
 When cool, cut into thin strips (to make this easier, stack  egg  sheets and roll them into a cylindrical shape first). 
 Wash  bean sprouts , pinching off any straggly tails. 
 Drain the  agar-agar  well and cut into bite-sized strips. 
 Combine all the ingredients, cover and chill. 
 In a bowl whisk together the dressing, first crushing the  garlic  to a smooth paste with the  sugar . 
 Pour over the salad, toss and serve.
