Description : 
 Very nice  potato  croquettes as they are eaten in Belgium. Requires basic cooking skills and easy to prepare !
 
 Ingredients : 
 3  potatoes , peeled and cut into chunks 
 approx ½ cup  water 
 2 oz  butter 
 salt 
 a pinch of  nutmeg 
 2 oz  plain flour 
 2  eggs 
 vegetable oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 Place the  potatoes  in a large saucepan, cover with salted  water , bring to the boil then cook for 15-20 minutes until soft. 
 Drain the  potatoes  well, return to the pan and mash with a fork or potato masher. 
 Set aside. 
 In another saucepan, mix together the  water ,  butter ,  salt  and  nutmeg . 
 Bring to the boil then stir in the  flour  and reduce the heat a little. 
 Beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball, about 3 minutes. 
 Remove from the heat and add the  eggs , one at the time, beating well after each addition. 
 Continue to beat the mixture until smooth and shiny then add the mashed  potatoes  and mix well. 
 Preheat the deep fat fryer to 180°C, 350°F and preheat the oven to 170°C, 325°F, gas mark 3. 
 Drop tablespoons of the  potato  mixture into the  oil , flattening each croquette with the back of the spoon and cook for a few minutes until crisp and golden, turning once or twice. 
 You will need to do this in batches. 
 Drain well on kitchen paper and keep warm in the oven whilst you cook the remaining croquettes. 
 Serve hot.
