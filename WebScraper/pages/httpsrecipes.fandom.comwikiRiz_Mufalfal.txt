Description : 
 Oriental rice pilaf. Rice may be cooked in many ways. This method produces a fluffy but slightly moist pilaf with only a slight flavor of the small amount of fat which is stirred in to separate the grains. In Lebanon, a plateful of this pilaf covered with  laban  makes a full meal.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  long-grain rice 
 1 cup  water 
 1 heaping Tbsp  samneh  (or other  shortening ) 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Hot  water 
 Directions : 
 If  rice  is purchased in bulk in Arab markets, it should be soaked in hot  water  for half an hour and then rinsed well to remove loose surface starch which would make the finished pilaf gummy. 
 Packaged, washed  rice  need not be further cleaned. Melt samneh in heavy skillet and when smoking, add  rice . Stir until each  grain  is well coated. Add  salt  and  water . 
 Place over high fire until mixture boils up well and  rice  begins to absorb the  water . Then cover. Lower heat and cook without further stirring until tender. If all  water  is absorbed before  rice  is tender it may be necessary to add 1/4 cup more  water . 
 Remove from fire when tender, but leave covered in a warm place for 30 minutes, or place a wire rack between a very low flame and the pan. Stir very gently when ready to serve.
