Description : 
 it's DELICIOUS and low fat
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¾ lb fresh ripe fruit ( melon ,  papaya ,  mango ,  guava ) 
 3 drops yellow food color (or color of fruit, optional) 
 4 cups  milk 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 2 envelope  unflavored gelatin 
 ¾ cup  light corn syrup 
 ¾ tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Peel and seed fruit. Cut into chunks. In covered blender at medium speed or in food processor with knife blade attached, blend fruit (you may use any fruit of your choice) and 1 cup  milk  until smooth; set aside. 
 In 3-quart saucepan, sprinkle the 2 envelopes of  gelatin  evenly over 1 cup  milk . Cook over medium-low heat until  gelatin  is completely dissolved, stirring constantly. Remove saucepan from heat; stir in fruit mixture, remaining  milk ,  corn syrup , and remaining ingredients. (Mixture may have curdled appearance.) Pour mixture into 13" by 9" baking pan. Cover with foil and freeze until partially frozen, about 3 hours, stirring occasionally. 
 Spoon mixture into chilled large bowl; with mixer at medium speed, beat until smooth but still frozen. For smooth sherbet you must keep the fruit mixture frozen while you beat it, so it’s best if you chill the mixing bowl and beaters in the freezer for a while. (If the mixture melts,  ice  crystals may form, resulting in a coarse, icy texture). 
 Repeat as before, with beating mixture. Return mixture to pan. Cover and freeze until firm, about 3 hours.
