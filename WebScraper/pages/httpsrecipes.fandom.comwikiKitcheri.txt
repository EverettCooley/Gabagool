Description 
 A rice and bean dish that can be easily prepared in a crock-pot. Also if you have a stomache-ache this is easy on digestion and very nutritious. I find it great after a hard workout because it facilitates  prana .
 
 Ingredients 
 10 cups  water 
 1 cup  mung beans 
 2 cups  basmati rice 
 spices 
 ghee 
 Directions 
 Wash the rice 3 or more times until water runs nearly clear. 
 Place all ingredients in crock-pot. 
 Optionally you can saut√© the spices in ghee before placing in pot. 
 Make sure pot does not become dry add more water as required, cook until most of the water is absorbed and everything is real soft and kind of mushy consistency. 
 Ayurvedically speaking choose the spices and vegetables that best suit your dosha.
