Ingredients : 
 1 cup  rye bread  cut into pieces and dried in the oven 
 5 cups boiling  water 
 1 tbsp  sugar  (you can put more if you like it sweeter) 
 1 tsp  yeast 
 Directions : 
 Put dried pieces of bread in the big jar. 
 Add boiling water and leave to soak for 5 hours. 
 Then add sugar and yeast and leave in the warm place to ferment. 
 Fermentation usually lasts between 12 and 24 hours depending on the air temperature. 
 Then strain and put in the fridge. 
 Notes : 
 You can also substitute kvass in  okroshka  for  kefir  (butter milk). You will have to dilute it with water though if it is too thick.
Okroshka with kefir has different taste which i actually prefer to the one with kvass. It tastes unbelievable!
