Our immune system is the body’s first line of defence against outside attacks. It consists of cells and organs that are specialized in protecting the organism against viruses, harmful substances and various types of bacteria.
When we are under stress or when we are recuperating from an illness, our immune system is too weak to give us full protection and we find ourselves in a vulnerable state. In such situations we need to help our immune system to recover. One of the best immune system boosters is broccoli. This ‘super vegetable’ is rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, fibres, bioflavonoids and carotenoids, all very important elements that help the immune system work properly.
Vitamin A and bioflavonoids are delaying the aging process and they make great immune system boosters. Vitamin C is am antioxidant substance that has the role of protecting the tissues. The calcium and vitamin C that can be found in broccoli reduce the possibility of viruses entering the organism. Vitamin C also helps the body produce lymphocytes and antibodies. Another important vitamin found in broccoli is vitamin E that helps produce immune cells. The two carotenoids found in broccoli are lutein and zeaxanthin. They play a major role in the production of lymphocytes (the most important cells when it comes to fighting diseases). Selenium is a compound that helps the body produces more antibodies and immune cells. 
Broccoli is a vegetable that shouldn’t miss from your daily diet if you want to live many healthy years.
