 Steps for preparation : 
 1. Check your local market for fresh  prawns . Look for medium-large size prawns, as this will make your curry tastier!  
 2. Proceed to  marinate  your prawns by dicing onions and ginger. Mix these ingredients to your prawns and add in turmeric powder, fish sauce, chicken powder and some salt. 
 3. The next step involves making a gravy sauce which you will be adding to your prawns later. 
 4. To make the gravy sauce,  sauté  diced onions, ginger, garlic and add to a heated pan with oil. While being sautéd, add turmeric powder and chili powder. The quantity of chili powder can vary according to the person. If you want to make a spicy curry, add a bit more chili powder. 
 5. Once the gravy sauce is done, add in the marinated prawns and let it cook for a few minutes. Add some vegetable stock later into the pan. 
 6. Have some tomatoes cut into wedge shapes ready to be added to the dish. Wait approximately 5 minutes and then add the tomatoes followed with  capsicum  rings. Cook until well done. 
 7. After it’s done cooking, serve in a bowl and add a few coriander leaves as garnish. 
 8. Your prawn curry dish is ready to eat! Tastes best with some steamed white rice.
