Cardamom Braids
 Combine :
 
 2 tablespoons yeast 
 ¼ cup lukewarm water 
 Add :
 
 2 cup warm milk 
 ¾ cup sugar 
 1½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ cup shortening 
 1½ teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 2 eggs, beaten 
 7 to 8 cups white flour 
 Mix & knead until elastic. Let rise twice. Divide dough in half, divide each half into thirds, shape into 13 inch rope. Place 3 ropes on a greased baking sheet, braid ropes, pinch ends to seal. Bake when risen at 350° for 25 to 30 minutes.
 This recipe is also good for making rolls; instead of making ropes, roll dough into golf ball sized lumps, let rise, and then bake.
