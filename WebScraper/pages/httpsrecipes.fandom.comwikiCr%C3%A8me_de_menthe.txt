 About Crème de menthe : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Crème de menthe on Wikipedia 
 Crème de menthe is a sweet, spearmint- or peppermint-flavored liqueur. It is available commercially in a clear (called "white") and a green version (which obtains its color from the mint leaves or from the addition of coloring, if extract and not the leaves are used to make the liqueur). Both varieties have similar flavors and are interchangeable in recipes, except where the color is important.
 Crème de menthe is used as an ingredient in several cocktails, such as the Grasshopper and the Vodka Stinger, but it is also served as an after-dinner drink and can be used in food recipes such as brownies or cakes.
 One recipe for making crème de menthe includes sugar, water, grain alcohol (188 proof), pure peppermint extract, and the optional green food coloring. A traditional recipe involves steeping dried peppermint leaves in grain alcohol for several weeks (creating a naturally green color), followed by filtration and the addition of sugar. [2]
