 About non-fat milk : 
 Milk which contains less than Â½ percent of milk fat. Generally, non-fat milk has been fortified with vitamin A and D to improve the nutritional values.
 Skim milk contains more calcium than whole milk. Most of the calcium in milk is never bound up in the fat globules that are removed when 'skimming' the milk, but rather in the water content of the milk. Removing the part of the milk with a lower percentage of calcium, increases the relative percentage of calcium in the remaining milk.
