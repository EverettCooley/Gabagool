 Ingredients : 
 2 x 15-ounce cans of diced  tomatoes  (for convenience use pre-seasoned  tomatoes  from a reliable gluten-free source and omit the addition of herbs from the ingredients list) 
 1 x 15-ounce can of  tomato sauce 
 2 tablespoons of fresh or dried  parsley 
 1 teaspoon  sugar 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon of fresh or dried  rosemary 
 ½ teaspoon of fresh or dried  thyme 
 ½ teaspoon of dried  oregano 
 1 medium  onion  minced 
 1 clove of  garlic  minced 
 2 tablespoons of  olive oil 
 1 small  green bell pepper  diced 
 ½ to 1-cup of fresh, cleaned, thickly sliced  mushrooms  or small can of  mushrooms 
 2 pounds to 2½ pounds of  chicken  pieces 
 Directions : 
 Add all ingredients to crock-pot at one time. 
 Cook for eight hours on low heat setting. 
 Spoon over cooked  white rice , risotto, or your favorite gluten free pastas. 
 Sprinkle some  Parmesan cheese  on top (if you can have dairy). 
 Note : 
 You may elect to cut boneless, skinless  chicken  into strips or pieces, however, it is best to add them whole as the meat will break apart during cooking. The result will most likely be smaller pieces of  chicken  in the sauce.
