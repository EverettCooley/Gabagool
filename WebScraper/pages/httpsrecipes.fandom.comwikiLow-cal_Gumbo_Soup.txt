Description : 
 This doesn't resemble the real Cajun  gumbo , but is good for those days when you feel you've over-indulged and need to cut back. I keep in it the fridge and use it as a snack when I just have to have something else. You can also add herbs,  hot pepper , it is very versatile, and a good starting recipe. 
 
 Original, from files of A. Broaddus/Houston 5/16/9 
 Ingredients : 
 12 cups  water 
 6 tsp  vegetable bouillon  granules 
 4  tomatoes , fresh or 1-lb can 
 ½ cup  corn , fresh or canned 
 1  celery  rib, diced 
 1  onion , diced 
 ½ cup  okra , cut 
 ¼ cup  rice ,  white  or  brown 
 ⅛ tsp  tabasco sauce  (optional) 
 1 cup shredded  cabbage  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Place all ingredients in a large pot, bring to boil, cover and simmer about 20 minutes until all vegetables are done. 
 Notes : 
 I use Uncle Ben's  converted rice  as it seems to hold its shape better in long cooking periods. Any  rice  will work if this soup is not reheated several times, but it usually is! 
 This is a thin soup, i sometimes add shredded  cabbage ,  chard ,  bok choy , or other green vegetable to it. The greens make it thicker and more filling, but add few calories. 
 Nutritional information : 
 1½ cups serving equals about 35 calories.
