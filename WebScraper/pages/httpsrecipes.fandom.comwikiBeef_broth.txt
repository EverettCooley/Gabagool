 About Beef stock and broth : 
 Beef stock is typically made from beef bones and some herbs and spices boiled down in water. It is distinguished from beef broth which uses meat in the process. They are often used interchangeably.
 A flavored liquid made from the juices remaining after cooking meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, or similar ingredients in water. Meat broths typically started with bones that add gelatin to the finished broth, while the meat and fat add substance, aroma, and flavor. To produce a broth the liquid that remains after the ingredients have cooked is defatted, strained to remove bones and particles, and often enhanced with herbs and spices to improve the flavor. Vegetable broths, which contain little or no fat, can at times be substituted for meat broths. However, the stock may lack flavor and aroma provided by the fats in the meat. If a vegetable stock is desired, it may be best to roast the vegetables with the skins on in order allow the sugars in the vegetables to be released into the broth, enhancing the flavor, the aroma and the appearance. 
 Beef broth is typically made from cuts of beef and some herbs and spices boiled down in water. It is distinguished from beef stock which uses only the bones in the process. They are often used interchangeably.
