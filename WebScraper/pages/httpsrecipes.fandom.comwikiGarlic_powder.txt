 About garlic powder : 
 Garlic powder is made from dehydrated  garlic flakes  that have been ground into a powdery substance. It is used as a seasoning.
 Garlic powder is used in various recipes, such as soups, sauces, stews, or as a seasoning for meat dishes. Basically, garlic powder is used instead of garlic cloves, in meals which require the same flavor, but not the same texture as the one belonging to the fresh garlic, which, if not minced, does not spread its aroma.
