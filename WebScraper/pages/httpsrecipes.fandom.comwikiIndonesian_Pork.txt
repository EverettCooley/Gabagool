I'm not sure where I found this recipe, but it sounded so weird to me at the time, I just had to try it. I do a lot of outdoor cooking on the grill. I'm lucky enough to have a Big Green  egg  out on my deck to cook on. It is a ceramic barbecue with a fire brick interior and uses charcoal. You can use a gas grill, too... just be sure to try this recipe. You will be pleasantly surprise.
 
       Indonesian Pork     
 Ingredients : 
 2-3 lbs boneless  Pork  loin 
 1/4 cup  Peanut   butter 
 1/4 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon crushed hot  red pepper flakes 
 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 
 1 tablespoon  brown sugar 
 3 tablespoons soy sauce 
 2 cloves  garlic , minced or pressed 
 2  green onions , minced (optional) 
 1/2 cup  chicken broth  (any broth is fine) 
 Directions : 
 What I do is take a 2-3 pound piece of boneless  Pork  loin and cut it into"chops" and then cut the chops in half and then pound each half until thin.  
Combine the marinade ingredients and pour over  Pork .  
Thoroughly coat all pieces of meat.  
(I put everything in a Ziploc plastic bag).  
Marinate for several hours.  
When ready to cook, thread  Pork  onto skewers (I kind of"sew" the meat back and forth onto the skewers) and cook on heated grill over moderate heat for 12–14 minutes, turning once.  
It doesn't take long for the  Pork  to cook because it has been pounded thin, so be sure not to overcook it or it will be dry.
