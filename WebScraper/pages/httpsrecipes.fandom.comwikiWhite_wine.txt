 About White wine : 
 White wines are made from the grape juice and grape skin of green, gold or yellowish colored grapes or from just the juice (not the skin) of select red grapes (as in some  Champagnes ). 
 A beverage containing alcohol, which is produced from fermented grape juice. White wine is a non-sparkling wine, which may vary in color intensity and can be dry, which is non-sweet, semisweet, or sweet. Its flavor will depend on the type of grapes that it is made from. White wines are served chilled unlike red wines, which are ideally served at 65Â°F (or room temperature). White wines should be served immediately after opening.
