 Wikipedia Article  About Epazote on Wikipedia 
 Epazote or Mexican Tea (Chenopodium ambrosioides) is a herb native to Central America and southern Mexico. It is an annual or short-lived perennial plant, growing to 1.2 m tall, irregularly branched, with oblong-lanceolate leaves up to 12 cm long. The flowers are small and green, produced in a branched panicle at the apex of the stem.
 As well as in its native area, it is grown in warm temperate to subtropical areas of Europe and the United States, sometimes becoming an invasive weed.
