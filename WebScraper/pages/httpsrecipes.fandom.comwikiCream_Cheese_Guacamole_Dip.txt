Description : 
         
 Similar to the classic guacamole, this glorious, savory Mexican dip is made and packed with real vegetables, cream cheese, and lemon juice and is great with corn, potato, or tortilla chips to help maintain its stone-cold consistency. Serve up a creamy treat with other appetizers so when you get up and go, all you have to do is make this guacamole tastier with cheese and other spices.
