 About Goji berries : 
 As a food, dried goji berries are traditionally cooked before consumption. Dried goji berries are often added to rice congee and almond jelly, as well as used in Chinese tonic soups, in combination with chicken or pork, vegetables, and other herbs such as wild yam, Astragalus membranaceus, Codonopsis pilosula, and licorice root. The berries are also boiled as an herbal tea, often along with chrysanthemum flowers and/or red jujubes, or with tea, particularly pu-erh tea, and packaged teas are also available.
 Various wines containing goji berries (called gǒuqǐ jiǔ; 枸杞酒) are also produced, including some that are a blend of grape wine and goji berries.
 At least one Chinese company also produces wolfberry beer, and New Belgium Brewery makes their seasonal Springboard ale with wolfberries used as flavoring. Since the early 21st century, an instant coffee product containing goji berry extract has been produced in China.
 Young goji berry shoots and leaves are also grown commercially as a leaf vegetable.
