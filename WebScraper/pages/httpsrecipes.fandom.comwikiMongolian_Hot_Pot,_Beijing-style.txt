Ingredients : 
 1 lb lean boneless  leg of lamb 
 lamb  tail fat, sliced 
 ginger  slices 
 scallion  slices 
 soy sauce 
 For the dips : 
 sesame paste 
 fermented bean curd 
 shrimp   oil 
 soy sauce 
 vinegar 
 rice wine 
 preserved Chinese  chive flowers 
 preserved sweet  garlic 
 Chinese coriander (or  cilantro ), chopped 
 chile  ( chile oil ) 
 Cooking utensil : 
 a charcoal-burning fire pot for cooking at the table. 
 Directions : 
 Cut the mutton into paper-thin slices about 2Â½ inches by 1 inch. It will be easier to slice if partially frozen first. Spread them on individual serving dishes. Arrange the dips and side dishes in bowls. 
 Half-fill the fire pot with boiling  water . Add the sliced  scallion  and  ginger , mutton tail fat, and a little soy sauce. Cover the pot lid tightly. Fill the chimney with burning charcoal and bring the stock to a boil. 
 To eat, the diners mix their own sauces from the condiments and seasonings. Then they pick up the mutton slices and cook them in the boiling stock for a few seconds, until the meat turns pinkish-white. The meat is then dipped into the sauce. The best pastry to go with the meat is shaobing - the chinese baked sesame cakes.
