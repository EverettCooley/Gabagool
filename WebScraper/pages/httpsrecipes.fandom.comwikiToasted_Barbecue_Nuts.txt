 ⅓ cup water, hot or lukewarm only 
 1 tbsp. liquid smoke 
 1 tsp. Worcestershire 
 1 ½ cup mixed salted nuts 
 1 tbsp. butter, melted 
 3 tbsp. garlic powder

 1 tbsp. barbecue spice rub

 Heat oven to 250° C. In a small pan, mix water, liquid smoke, and Worcestershire. Add nuts. 
 Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Drain nuts; spread nuts on ungreased jelly roll pan; bake at 250 for 50 to 55 minutes. 
 In a small bowl, mix butter, barbecue spice rub, garlic powder, and chili powder (optional). Add toasted nuts; toss nuts with butter until all nuts are coated.
