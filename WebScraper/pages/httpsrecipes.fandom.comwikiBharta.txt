 Contributed by  Catsrecipes Y-Group 
 Serves 4 to 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs (900 g)  eggplants  (aubergines) 
 3 – 4 medium  tomatoes , cored and coarsely chopped 
 ¼ cup (60 ml) finely chopped  cilantro  (coriander leaves) plus additional for garnish 
 2 tsp (10 ml)  ground coriander 
 2 tsp (10 ml) ground  cumin 
 1 tsp (5 ml)  turmeric 
 ¼ tsp (1 ml)  cayenne pepper , or to taste 
 ½ cup (125 ml)  ghee 
 2 cloves  garlic , finely chopped 
 1 tbsp (15 ml) finely chopped fresh  ginger 
 1  onion , finely chopped 
 1 tsp (5 ml)  garam masala 
 salt and freshly ground  pepper  to taste 
 the juice of 1  lemon 
 Directions : 
 Pierce the eggplants several times with a sharp knife and bake on a baking sheet in a preheated 450°F (220°C) oven for 1 hour. 
 Allow to cool slightly and split the eggplants open. 
 Scoop out the flesh and discard the skin. 
 Chop the flesh coarsely and add the tomatoes, cilantro, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne, stirring to combine thoroughly. 
 Heat the ghee in a large skillet over moderate heat until it is very hot. 
 Add the garlic and ginger and stir for 15 seconds. 
 Add the onion and stir until the onion is tender but not browned, about 3 minutes. 
 Add the eggplant mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture has thickened enough that it begins to draw away from the sides of the pan, 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Stir in the garam masala, salt, and pepper and transfer to a serving bowl. 
 Garnish with the remaining cilantro and lemon juice.
