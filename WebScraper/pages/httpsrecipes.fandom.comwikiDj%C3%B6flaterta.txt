       Djöflaterta     
 Devil's cake. This type of  chocolate  cake is very popular all over Iceland, and you can buy a slice in most cafes and bakeries. I like it best when it has been frozen and thawed before glazing, because the cake will then be nicely moist. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¾ cup  flour 
 1½ cup  sugar 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ⅔ cup  milk 
 1 tsp  baking soda 
 2  eggs   or  1  egg  and 2  yolks  (use whites to make angel's  cream  icing) 
 ½ cup dark  cocoa 
 100 g  margarine / butter  (soft) 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Mix together the dry ingredients. 
 Add  milk  and mix well. 
 Add  eggs ,  soft margarine / butter  and  vanilla extract  and mix well. 
 Pour into two cake pans and bake at 175°C until firm. 
 Remove gently from pans and cool. 
 When cold, spread one half with rhubarb jam (leave it out if you don't have any), and spread  cocoa  icing over the jam. 
 Put the other half on top and cover with  chocolate  icing. 
 For a darker cake, use more dark  cocoa . 
 Proper devil's cake should be almost black in colour. 
 Other decoration ideas: cover with cocoa- butter  icing. 
 Put mashed  bananas  between the layers.
