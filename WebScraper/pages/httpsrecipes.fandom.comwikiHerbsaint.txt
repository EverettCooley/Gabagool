 About Herbsaint : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Herbsaint on Wikipedia 
 Herbsaint is a brand name of anise-flavored liqueur, originally made in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 Herbsaint first appeared in 1934. It was the creation of J.M. Legendre of New Orleans, who learned how to make absinthe while in France during World War I. It first went on sale following the repeal of Prohibition, and was unique in its category as an absinthe substitute, as opposed to a pastis. Although Herbsaint was originally produced under the name "Legendre Absinthe" it never contained wormwood. The alcohol control bureau at the time objected to the use of the word Absinthe so it was changed to Legendre Herbsaint. The Sazerac company bought the J.M. Legendre & Co. on January 1, 1940. The original recipe was used for many years, but was eventually changed in the 1970s, producing the modern Herbsaint available today.
