INGREDIENTS : 
 1/2 cup ketchup 
 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 
 3/4 pound lean ground beef 
 1/3 cup diced onion 
 1/3 cup diced green pepper 
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
 1/4 teaspoon  steak seasoning 
 1 prebaked thin pizza crust, such as Boboli 
 6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled 
 1/4 cup diced dill pickle 
 1 cup shredded cheddar 
 1 cup shredded mozzarella 
 2 roma tomatoes, thinly sliced 
 INSTRUCTIONS : 
 Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place a pizza stone in the oven if you have one. 
 In a small bowl mix together ketchup and mustard to make sauce. 
 In a large skillet, sauté ground beef for 3 to 4 minutes, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon. Add onion and green pepper and continue to cook until meat is no longer pink. Spoon off any excess grease. 
 Add salt and steak seasoning to ground beef mixture. Mix 1 tablespoon of sauce into ground beef mixture. 
 Spread some sauce on the pizza crust. I just add a thin layer of sauce. You can always drizzle additional sauce on top of the pizza. 
 Sprinkle half of the cheddar cheese and half of the mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce. 
 Spoon the ground beef mixture onto the pizza crust and sprinkle with bacon and pickles. 
 Top with remaining cheese and roma tomato slices. 
 Place on baking stone, directly on oven rack, or on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
