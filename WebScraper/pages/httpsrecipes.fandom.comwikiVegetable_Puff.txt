 Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before unfolding. 
 After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat sheet and roll it with a pin to make it a little thinner. The pastry sheet would now be about 12" x 12". 
 Cut the sheet into 6 pieces. 
 Place about 2-3 Tbsp of the cooked vegetable onto the sheet and fold it around it. Seal all the corners, by pressing the sheets together and applying a little  water . 
 Stick it into a pre-heated oven (350 F) for about 20-30 minutes or until it browns. Make sure that you flip it around every 5-10 minutes.
