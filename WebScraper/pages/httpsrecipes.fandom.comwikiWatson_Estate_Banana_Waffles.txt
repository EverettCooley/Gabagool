 Description : 
 Purchased from the Watson Estate in McKinney, Texas in 1991. Dated 1931. Notation on card said this was served every Sunday (with variations) for over 30 years in Grandpa Jack’s house. I have made these recipes with all variations (to follow) and there is not a bad one in the bunch. My favorite my far is the  Bacon  Waffles. Yummy.
