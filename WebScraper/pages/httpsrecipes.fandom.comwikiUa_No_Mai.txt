 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 5  bamboo shoots , which may be no mai lai (GIANTOCHLOA NIGROCILIATA) or no mai bong (BAMBUSA TULDA) - choose small ones, boil them until they lose their ( bitter ) taste, then cut off all the hard outer layer and cut the trimmed shoots into sections 8Â cm long - after this use a needle to make slits in them lengthwise, but leaving the ends of each section intact 
 7 (small) shallots, pounded 
 1 piece of  Pork , including some fat, the size of the palm of a hand, minced 
 2  eggs 
 salt  and fish sauce 
 flour  (about 2 tbsp) 
 ground  black pepper 
 chopped spring  Onion  leaves 
 Pork  fat 
 Directions : 
 Mix together in a large bowl the minced  Pork , the pounded shallots, ground  black pepper  and I tablespoonful of the  flour . Mix all this thoroughly. Add  salt , fish sauce and some of the chopped spring  onions . Mix again, taste to check the saltiness, and add more of the chopped spring  Onion . 
 Stuff the mixture into the slit-open  bamboo shoots  and wrap these in pieces of  banana  leaf as you would in making a kanab. Use a bamboo holder to grill the packages until they are cooked, then open up the  banana  leaf coverings and leave the contents to cool. 
 Heat some  Pork  fat in a wok. Beat the  eggs  in a bowl with  salt  and some  flour  mixed in. Dip the cooked  bamboo shoots  in the  egg  mixture and fry them in the hot fat until they are nice and golden. Place them on a platter to serve.
