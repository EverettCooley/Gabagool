      Ridderost     
 A Norwegian cheese produced from pasteurized cow's milk. This cheese is made with a outer coating of annato, a rust colored paste commonly used to coat foods, providing a distinctive color to the food. Semi-firm in texture, Ridderost cheese has a smooth buttery flavor that is mildly sharp in taste. It can be served as a snacking cheese, a cheese with appetizers or as a cheese to add to salads.
