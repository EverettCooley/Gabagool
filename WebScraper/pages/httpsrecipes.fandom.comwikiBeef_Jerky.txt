 Cook Time : 10 hours 
 Ingredients 
 1  flank  or  London Broil  steak (or other very lean cut of meat) 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1 cup  soy sauce 
 aluminum foil 
 Directions 
 Preheat the oven to 150 °F. 
 Cut the steak into strips with the grain of the meat. It is very important to cut along the grain or the cooked meat will fall apart into small pieces! 
 Pour the soy sauce into a bowl and dip the meat strips in it. Lay the strips out on a piece of foil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the strips on a metal rack in the oven with foil below to catch the drippings for 10 hours.
