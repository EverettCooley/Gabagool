 Wikipedia Article  About Coffee liqueurs on Wikipedia 
 A Liqueur coffee, as its name suggests, is a coffee brew with a measure of liqueur. This brew is usually served in a clear glass with the coffee and cream separated for effect. The cream is added carefully, so that it floats on top of the coffee and liqueur mixture. Sugar is usually required in the coffee mixture to help the cream float.
