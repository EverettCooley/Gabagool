Description : 
       Arroz con Leche     
 This dessert is delicious with Spanish dessert wines. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 liter  milk 
 200 grams of short round  arborio rice  (or paella rice /  risotto rice ) 
 100 grams of  sugar  (white or brown, depending on preference) 
 250 ml  water 
 1 teaspoon of  salt 
 grated zest of one  lemon 
 ground  cinnamon 
 1  cinnamon  stick (for boiling) 
 cinnamon  sticks (for garnish) 
 Directions : 
 Place the  water ,  rice ,  cinnamon  stick,  lemon  zest,  salt  and  sugar  in a saucepan or pot and bring to a boil. 
 When boiling, lower heat, cover and let simmer until the  water  is nearly all absorbed (keep checking every minute, so as not to burn). 
 Add the  milk  when most of the  water  has absorbed and continue cooking until the  rice  is extra tender and “bloated”. 
 Stir and the texture should be creamy. 
 Add a splash more  milk  if necessary (whole fat). 
 Remove the  cinnamon  stick. 
 Serve the arroz con leche warm (or chilled), and garnish with  cinnamon  powder on top and  cinnamon  sticks on the side.
