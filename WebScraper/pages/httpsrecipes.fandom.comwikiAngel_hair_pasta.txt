 About Capellini : 
 Capellini, (literally "thin hair") is a very thin variety of Italian pasta. Like  spaghetti , it is rod-shaped, in the form of long strands, and thinner than  vermicelli . Because they are so fine, capelli d'angelo must be served either in a very light sauce or in a simple broth.
