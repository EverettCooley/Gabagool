 Soak  chana dal  in  water  for a few hours prior to use.

 Add  onions  and let it heat till they turn translucent. 
 Add chopped  tomato  and  curry  leaves and then the  chana dal , making sure to add enough  water  to cover the  dal  as it boils. 
 Cook on medium-high heat with a closed lid for 15-20min until the  chana dal  softens, while continuing to replenish the  water  now and again as it evaporates (make sure that you add boiling and not cold  water ). 
 As soon as chana begins to soften, add the sliced  capsicum  (or diced bottlegourd, if that is your preference). 
 Stir it in well with the chana and continue to cook until both the chana and  capsicum  (or bottlegourd), have softened sufficiently. 
 Garnish with  cilantro . 
 Serve with  rice  or paratha.
