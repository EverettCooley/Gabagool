Description : 
 Green plantain chips
 
 Makes 2 to 2½ cups of chips 
 Ingredients : 
 2 large green  plantains , peeled and cut into paper-thin slices 
 peanut  or  vegetable oil  for deep frying 
 salt  to taste 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Place the  plantain  slices in a bowl, cover them with cold  water , and soak 30 minutes (if you are frying right away, you do not need to soak in  water ). 
 Drain the slices and pat dry with paper towels. 
 In a frying pan or deep fryer over medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches of  oil  to 375°F, or until a slice of  plantain  sizzles when it touches the  oil , and fry the  plantain  chips a handful at a time, turning them with a slotted spoon until they are golden brown and crisp. 
 Do not fry too many chips at once, or the  oil  temperature will fall and the chips will be soggy rather than crisp. 
 Drain on a paper-towel-lined platter, transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with  salt , and serve hot.
