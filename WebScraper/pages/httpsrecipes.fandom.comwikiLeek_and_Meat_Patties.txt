Ingredients : 
 2 large bunches fresh  leeks , (about 8 medium size) 
 1 lbs lean  ground beef 
 2 large  eggs , beaten 
 ¼ cup  matzo meal   or   matzo cake meal 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp ground  black pepper 
 For frying : 
 ½ cup  matzo cake meal , for coating 
 vegetable oil 
 3 to 4 large  eggs , beaten 
 Directions : 
 To clean the  leeks , cut off and discard the roots and all but 1 to 2 inches of the green tops. 
 Slice the  leeks  in half lengthwise and rinse them very well under cool running  water  to remove any grit. 
 Coarsely chop the  leeks  and put them in a saucepan with  water  to cover. 
 Simmer them, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are very tender. 
 Drain the  leeks  well; then cool them until they can be handled. 
 Use your hands to squeeze out all the excess liquid. 
 Grind the  leeks  in a meat grinder (or very coarsely puree them with a food processor). 
 In a medium-size bowl, combine the  leeks  with the ground  beef ,  eggs , ¼ cup matzo meal,  salt , and  pepper . 
 Use your hands or a fork to blend them well. The mixture should be soft, but firm enough to be molded into patties. Add more matzo meal, if necessary. 
 Form the leek-meat mixture into small patties about 2 inches wide and ½-inch thick, coating each with cake meal to make it easier to shape. 
 In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat  oil  that is about ¼-inch deep until it is hot but not smoking. 
 Dip each patty into the beaten  egg  to coat it and drain off the excess; then immediately set it in the hot  oil . 
 Fry the patties until they are golden brown on both sides.
