Marmite  (pronounced /ˈmɑrmaɪt/) is the name given to two similar food spreads: a British version (original and first) produced in the United Kingdom and later South Africa, and a version produced in New Zealand. Marmite is made from yeast extract, a by-product of beer brewing, and is suitable for vegetarians and vegans.
 The British version of the product is a sticky, dark brown paste with a distinctive, powerful flavour, which is extremely salty and savoury with umami qualities, somewhat comparable to soy sauce. This distinctive taste is reflected in the British company's marketing slogan: "Love it or hate it." It is similar to the Australian  Vegemite  and Swiss  Cenovis .
 The distinctive product was originally British (1902), but a version with a different flavour has been manufactured in New Zealand since 1919, and this is the dominant version in New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific Islands.
 
 Cooking vessel : 
 In France, the term applies to a tall, covered, straight-sided cooking pot, used for long-cooking stews and dishes such as cassoulet and Pot-Au-Feu. It's usually made of Earthenware. "Petites marmites" are identically shaped miniature covered pots used as soup bowls.
