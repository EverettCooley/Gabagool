Description : 
 What curries are to foods of Asian origin,  piripiri  is to the cuisine of Mozambique. Originally the name of a small, red  capsicum   pepper , piripiri today can refer to any of the various hot, spicy dishes made with the fresh  pepper  itself or with the dried, ground powder it produces.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4  red peppers , crushed or 2 heaping tsp  cayenne pepper 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 juice of 2 medium-size  lemons 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 6 sprigs  parsley , chopped 
 1 cup  butter  or  oil 
 Directions : 
 For a marinade, combine all the ingredients except  butter  in a bowl with meat or seafood. 
 Stir to coat each piece well. 
 If you’ll be cooking within a couple of hours, let the mixture sit at room temperature; otherwise, cover and refrigerate. 
 Marinating overnight allows all the flavors to blend nicely. 
 To make a sauce for basting, combine everything, including the  butter . 
 If you have made a marinade, you can use the liquid left in the bowl after the pieces of meat are removed, but it may be necessary to add a bit more of each ingredient in roughly the same proportions as before. 
 To make a table sauce for the cooked meat, prepare a fresh mixture of all the ingredients and heat it gently for five minutes before serving. 
 As a variation for basting  chicken , substitute 1 cup of  coconut milk  for the  lemon juice .
