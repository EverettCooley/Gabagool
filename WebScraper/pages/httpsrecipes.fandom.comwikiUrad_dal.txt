 About Urad dal : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Urad Dal on Wikipedia 
 Urd, urd bean, urad, urid, black gram, black lentil or white lentil (Vigna mungo) is a bean grown in southern Asia. It is largely used to make dal from the whole or split, dehusked seeds. It, along with mung bean was placed in Phaseolus but has been transferred to Vigna. It was at one point considered to belong to the same species as mung bean.
 Black gram originated in India where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India. It has also been introduced to other tropical areas mainly by Indian immigrants.
 It is an erect, sub-erect or trailing, densely hairy annual herb. The tap root produces a branched root system with smooth, rounded nodules. The pods are narrow, cylindrical and up to 6 cm long. It is the most nutritious of all pulses and is recommended for diabetics. It is boiled and eaten whole or after splitting into dal. It is extensively used in various culinary preparation like idli, curries and papad. Though very beneficial in limited quantities excessive intake causes flatulence, which some sources claim can be prevented by adding a little asafoetida, pepper and ginger in the cultinary preparations.
 The product known as "black lentils" is usually the whole urd bean or urad dal. The product known as "white lentils" is the same lentil with the black skin removed.
