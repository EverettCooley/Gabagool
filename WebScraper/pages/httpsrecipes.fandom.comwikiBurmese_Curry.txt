 Description : 
 Well - I had a go at cooking a Burmese style  Chicken   curry .I have to admit that cooking this dish was very much an Indian/Chinese “fusion” experience: it’s effectively a Punjabi-style  Chicken  dish - but without  tomatoes  or  peppers  - and instead:  coconut milk  and besan ( gram flour ) with a dash of Thai sauce at the finish.
 Here is a Route79-style illustrated guide to cooking this exquisite dish:
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 8 medium-size  Chicken  thighs - no bone - no skin - chopped into bite-size chunks. 
 2 medium  onions  - sliced relatively finely. 
 400ml of  chicken broth . I made this from a Marks and Spencer concentrate jar - although you could just use Oxo or “bouillon”  Chicken  cubes. 
 100ml of  coconut milk  - I made this from “Rajah creamed  coconut ” bar - chopping off a chunk and dissolving it in warm  water . 
 3 tablespoons of  gram flour  (which is ground chick-pea  flour  - otherwise called “besan”). 
 1 chunk of pre-pulped  garlic . (See a previous recipe where I explain what these pre-pulped  garlic  and  ginger  pieces are.) 
 1 chunk of pre-pulped  ginger . 
 1  cinnamon  stick (otherwise known as dal-chini) slit into two pieces. 
 2  bay leaves . (Did you know that  bay leaf  is the leaf of the “laurel” tree? The leaves of this tree were considered holy in the days of the Roman Empire - and were used to “crown” honoured people - hence the laurel wreath and hence the term “resting on your laurels”.) 
 Spices: Ground coriander,  garam masala , chillie,  salt ,  turmeric . 
 A bottle of Thai sauce - just a few drops needed for this dish. 
 Directions : 
 Fry the  onions  in some  vegetable oil  for a few minutes - until they are translucentish. Then add the spices - a teapoon of  turmeric , a teaspoon of chillie powder, a teaspoon of  salt , 2 teaspoons of coriander and 2 teaspoons of  garam masala . Stir well.
 
       Fry the onions until limp     
         Add the powdered spices and stir     
 
Once the  onions /spice mixture has been stirred well - add the chopped  Chicken  thigh pieces - and stir fry on high heat:
 
 
         Spices stirred well     
         Add the chopped chicke and stir until thoroughly     
 
Thoroughly coat the  Chicken  in the  Onion /spice mixture - until the  Chicken  has gone “rubbery”. Then add the pre-prepared  chicken broth , as well as the  bay leaves  and  cinnamon  stick pieces:
 
 
         Thoroughly coated chicken     
         Add chicken broth,bay leaves and cinnamon     
 Simmer the pot for around 20 minutes. Whilst that is simmering - add about half-glass of warm  water  to the  gram flour  powder and stir until all lumps are out. Sieve through a tea-strainer to make sure you remove all lumps of clumped  gram flour  - and then pour into  Chicken  pot. Stir and then pour in the  coconut milk . Stir thoroughly - at this point the pot should be thickening a bit. Keep stirring until you get to a consistent simmer. Leave it simmering with lid off for another 30 mins.
 After the 30 mins of simmering - add a few drops of Thai sauce from the bottle and stir thoroughly:
 
 
         Simmer for another 30 mins.Stir occasionally.After 30 mins add a few drops of fish sauce .Stir and it's done     
 Taste to ensure that there’s enough  salt  - and add some if needed. Stir thoroughly.
 Turn off the heat - and it’s done! Serve on a bed of freshly-cooked  rice noodles  - or else (as in my case) on a bed of freshly-cooked  basmati rice .
 Enjoy!
 I really enjoyed cooking that - the  coconut milk ,  gram flour  and sauce add a completely different dimension to the sort of North Indian cooking that I’m used to - but I certainly will be cooking something like this again!
