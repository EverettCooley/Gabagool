An ingredient often used in Italian cooking that consists of crushed tomato that are processed through a sieve to create a slightly chunky mixture. Polpa is used as an ingredient to flavor soups, sauces and pasta dishes. Like Polpa, Sugocasa and Passata are varieties of Italian tomato products that are similar, but Polpa and Sugocasa are coarser in texture than Passata.
