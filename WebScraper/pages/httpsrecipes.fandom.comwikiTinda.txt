 The tinda, also called Indian round gourd, is an annual vine grown for its immature fruit, a vegetable especially popular in South Asia.
 The fruit is approximately spherical, and 5â€“8 cm in diameter. The seeds may also be roasted and eaten.
 This unique squash is native to India, very popular in Indian and Pakistani cooking with curry and many gourmet dishes. Green colored, apple sized fruits are flatish round in shape and 50-60 grams in weight. Plants are vigorous, productive and begin to bear fruits in 70 days after planting.
