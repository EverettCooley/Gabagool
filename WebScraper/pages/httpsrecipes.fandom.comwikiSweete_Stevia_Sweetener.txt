      Sweete Stevia Sweetener     
 Description : 
 According to the  Sweete website ,  Sweete Stevia Sweetener  is a "naturally grown, zero calorie Stevia plant extract". The product is manufactured by  Weider Global Nutrition  of Salt Lake City, Utah. Each 1.75 ounce box contains 50 sachets and retails for $7.49. Stevia  is often used as a natural alternative to artificial sweetners like  Equal ,  Splenda  and  Sweet 'n Low . Supermarket guru Phil Lempert remarks that Sweete's stevia product tastes like sugar, but has a grainier texture. [1] 
 This product doesn't exhibit some of the less appealing properties of most Stevia-based sweeteners: a slower onset of sweetness, a more lingering sweetness than that of sugar and a bitter  licorice  aftertaste. Sweete uses two extracts to combat these properties:  stevioside  and Rebaudioside-A. Sweete's Stevia Sweetener also contains maltodextrin and unidentified flavors.
