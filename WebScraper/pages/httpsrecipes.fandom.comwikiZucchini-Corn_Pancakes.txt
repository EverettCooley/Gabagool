 Salsa: In medium bowl, mix all ingredients. Set aside.
 
 Place shredded  zucchini  in colander in sink. Sprinkle with  salt  and let stand 10 minutes.
 
 Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 °F. In large heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat  oil  over medium heat. Add  corn  kernels and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes.
 
 Squeeze out as much moisture as possible from  zucchini , using your hands. Transfer to large bowl. Stir in beaten  eggs ,  flour ,  milk ,  cilantro ,  baking powder ,  pepper  and cooled  corn  until blended.
 
 Wipe out skillet. Coat with vegetable  cooking spray , then heat over medium-low heat until hot. For each pancake, add scant 1/4 cup batter to pan. Cook until golden underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook until set, 2 to 3 minutes more.
 
 Transfer to heatproof platter and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining batter, removing pan from heat and coating with more  cooking spray  between batches as necessary. Serve warm with salsa.
