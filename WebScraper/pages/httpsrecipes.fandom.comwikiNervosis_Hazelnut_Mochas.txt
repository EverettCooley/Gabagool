 Description : 
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Freshly brewed  coffee 
 2 tbsp  hot chocolate mix  (there are many that have no dairy, such as Giardelli) 
 Sugar  to taste 
 hazelnut  Torani syrup 
 soy milk 
 non-dairy  whipped cream  in a can 
 Directions : 
 While the  coffee  is brewing, warm the  soymilk  (about 1/2 - 3/4 cup depending on if you're making 1 or 2 mochas) over low heat. This is important.. it keeps it from coagulating when it hits the hot  coffee .
 Pour  coffee  into a big ol' mug (a mug that holds 2 cups of liquid) and fill it 3/4 of the way to the top.
 Add the  hot chocolate mix ,  hazelnut  syrup (I usually put one spoonful in) and  Sugar  (I use 2 spoons of  Sugar ) and mix it up.
 Fill to the brim with the  soymilk .
 Top off with a layer of  whipped cream .
