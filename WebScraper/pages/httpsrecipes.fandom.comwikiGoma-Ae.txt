 Ingredients : 
 2 large bunches of fresh  spinach , washed thoroughly and stems removed 
 toasted  sesame seeds 
 
 For the dressing: 
 
 1/4 cup  sake 
 1/2 cup toasted  sesame seeds 
 4 tsp liquid sweetener ( brown rice syrup  is best) 
 2 tbsp soy sauce 
 2 tsp  rice vinegar 
 water  to thin, if necessary 
 Directions : 
 First, steam the  spinach  until just wilted. Remove from heat and rinse under cold  water  to refresh. Chop into one inch thick strips and place in a bowl. For the dressing, heat the  sake  until just boiling (to simmer off the alcohol), and set aside. In your blender or food processor, grind the  sesame seeds  until they are a paste, then add the  sake  and all other ingredients and process until smooth. Stir this into the steamed and chopped  spinach , then portion out into four small bowls, and sprinkle with extra  sesame seeds . Chill until ready to serve.
