      Watermelon Juice     
 Ingredients : 
 10 lb  watermelon , chilled 
 Directions : 
 Watermelon juice isn't hard to do. It only takes minutes to prepare a beverage like this. This is commonly done in pool parties in above ground pools.
 
 Slice the watermelon lengthwise into slices 1 to 2 inches thick. 
 Carefully cut away the rind and discard. 
 Place as much of the fruit as will fit into a food processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. 
 Press through a fine sieve and discard seeds and pulp. 
 Pour the juice into a pitcher. 
 Repeat this process until all the watermelon has been blended and sieved. 
 This beverage is not only good for indoors but also in outdoors, like when you're standing outside watching a baseball game, your kids play in the yard or when you are just relaxing.
 Best when: Cold
