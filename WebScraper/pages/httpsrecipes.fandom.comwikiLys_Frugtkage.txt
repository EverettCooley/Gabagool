 1 cup  butter 
 1 cup  sugar 
 6  eggs 
 1½ cups  flour 
 1½ teaspoons  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ½ cup  white wine 
 1 cup  dried apricots  — chopped

 2 teaspoons  rum 
 2 cups  blanched almonds  — chopped 
 Directions : 
 Soften the  butter , gradually add the  Sugar , creaming well. 
 Add the  eggs , one at a time, beating after each addition. 
 Sift the 1½ cups of  flour ,  baking powder  and  salt  and add to the above mixture alternately with the ½ cup of wine. Beat well. 
 Combine all of the fruits and  nuts  and dredge the ½ cup of  flour .

 Pour the batter into the pans, filling about ⅔ full. 
 Decorate with  candied fruits  or  nuts  if you wish. 
 Bake about 2½ hours in a slow oven, 275°F. 
 (Placing the baking pans in shallow pans ¼ filled with  water  prevents the cakes from scorching on the bottom while they bake.)

 Remove brown paper. Return to racks and cool before storing.
