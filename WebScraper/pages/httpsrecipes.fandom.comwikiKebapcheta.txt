 Description : 
 Traditionally served with Luttenitza,  white beans , pickles or a salad.
 
 Ingredients : 
 450 g /1 lb  minced lamb 
 salt 
 ½ tsp  black pepper 
 1 tsp ground  allspice 
 1 tsp  paprika 
 1 tsp ground  cumin 
 Directions : 
 Place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well. Using your hands achieves a more even result. Cover with clingfilm and leave for 2–4 hours. 
 Preheat the grill to hot. 
 Shape the meat into 12 cylinders (about 12 cm/5-inches long and 2.5 cm/1 inch thick). Slightly flatten them just to stop them rolling around, then cook under the grill for 15–20 minutes, turning frequently and basting with  oil  if the meat is very lean.
