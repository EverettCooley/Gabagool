Ingredients : 
 1 cup butter, softened 
 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
 1 cup sugar 
 1 cup packed brown sugar 
 5 large eggs, room temperature 
 3 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 1 cup 2% milk 
 FROSTING: 
 1/4 cup butter, softened 
 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 
 2 cups confectioners' sugar 
 1 to 3 tablespoons 2% milk 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 325°. Grease and flour a 10-in. fluted tube pan. 
 In a large bowl, cream butter, peanut butter and sugars until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. In another bowl, whisk flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating after each addition just until combined. Transfer to prepared pan.  
 Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 65-75 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. 
 For frosting, in a large bowl, beat butter, peanut butter, sugar and salt. Beat in enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Spread over top of cake.
