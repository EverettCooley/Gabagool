Some Russians stick with the original recipes for some of their traditional dishes, such as Pelmeni or meat dishes while others prefer to bring new life to old recipes and add new ingredients and exotic spices which were unknown to Russians hundreds of years ago. The Russian cuisine uses elements from various cooking traditions borrowed from their neighbors and developed from their own traditional dishes. While there are no specific or unique preparation methods for Russian cooking, we should point out that attention to detail is important in the Russian cuisine. Using the right amount of spices for example is essential – either for spicing up the taste or for coloring the dish. The diversity of vegetables and cereals found in Russia is also noticed in the delicious dishes prepared by Russian cooks. Each traditional dish has a special cooking method, which is more or less general in all of Russia’s regions. Meat is one of the main elements of most Russian dishes and cured and smoked hams, poultry, pork and beef fillets, and bacons are often parts of delicious dishes. Smoked fish as well as other fish meat types are widely appreciated, and cooking styles may differ from highly specialized restaurant cooking to simple, rustic cooking methods.
