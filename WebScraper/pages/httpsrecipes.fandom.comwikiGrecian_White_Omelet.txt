 Ingredients : 
 ¾ pound 96% lean  ground round 
 8  egg whites 
 2 tablespoons  skim milk 
 ¾ cup  salsa , divided 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper , freshly ground 
 vegetable  cooking spray 
 2 tablespoons  feta  cheese, crumbled 
 Directions : 
 Brown beef in large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add ½ cup salsa and continue cooking for two minutes. 
 Whisk the egg whites and milk in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. 
 Heat the vegetable cooking spray in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the egg white mixture and cook until nearly set (2 – 4 minutes), using a spatula to pull in the sides of the omelet and all the uncooked egg to run underneath. 
 Sprinkle the beef mixture, remaining salsa, and feta cheese on top of the omelet. Carefully slide the omelet onto the serving plate, folding it by gently tipping the skillet. 
 Cover the eggs with a lid for the last 30 seconds you're cooking them for extra fluffiness.
