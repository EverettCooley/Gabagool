All-in-One Burger Stew
 Makes 6 servings
 1 pound lean ground beef 
2 cups frozen Italian vegetables 
1 can (14-1/2 ounces) chopped tomatoes with basil and garlic, undrained 
1 can (about 14 ounces) beef broth 
2-1/2 cups uncooked medium egg noodles 
Salt and black pepper 
 Cook meat in Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat until no 
longer pink, stirring to separate meat.
Drain drippings.
Add vegetables, tomatoes with juice and broth; bring to a boil over high 
heat. Add noodles; reduce heat to medium.
Cover and cook 12 to 15 minutes or until noodles have absorbed liquid
and vegetables are tender. Add salt and pepper to taste.
 Note For a special touch, sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving. 
 Tip To complete this meal, serve with breadsticks or a loaf of Italian 
bread and a mixed green and tomato salad
