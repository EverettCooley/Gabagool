 Description : 
 Pork chunks in red wine and coriander seeds sauce
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 kg / 2 lb boned lean  pork , diced 
 1 glass / 200 ml  red wine 
 1 â€“ 2 tbsp  coriander seeds , coarsely crushed 
 salt  and lots of freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 stick  cinnamon 
 6 tbsp  sunflower  or  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 Marinate the meat in the wine and spices for at least 4 hours overnight if possible. 
 Lift the meat out and save the marinade for later. 
 Heat the  oil  in a heavy based pot and brown the cubes of meat, a few at a time, until all are crisp and brown. 
 Add more  oil  if necessary. 
 Wipe any excess  oil  from the pan and return all the meat, pour over the marinade and add enough cold  water  to just cover the meat. 
 Cover the pot with a lid and cook gently, either in the oven or on the hob for about 30 minutes or until the meat is tender. 
 Almost all of the liquid should have evaporated to leave a thick sauce. 
 If necessary cook the afelia uncovered for a further 10 minutes to reduce excess liquid.
