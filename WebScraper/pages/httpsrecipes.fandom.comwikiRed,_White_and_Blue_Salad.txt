Description : 
 Featured for the Fourth! When fresh tomatoes are in season, I could literally live on this salad. The flavors just “sing!” and the colors are just right for the patriotic 4th (or 14th) of July.

 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 4 large ripe  tomatoes , about 1¼ pounds 
 2 medium-sized  red onions , about ¾ pound (or you could choose one of the infamous sweet onions) 
 1 tablespoon  sherry wine vinegar 
 ½ teaspoon finely chopped  garlic 
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin  olive oil 
 sea salt  and freshly ground  pepper  to taste 
 ¼ pound  blue cheese , at room temperature (I love Point Reyes blue from Marin County, CA) 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped  chives  and/or  basil  (would you believe  tarragon ?) 
 Directions : 
 Core the tomatoes and use a serrated knife to make thick slices. 
 Peel the onions and slice them about ¼-inch thick. 
 Arrange alternate and slightly overlapping sliced tomatoes and onions on serving plates. 
 Combine the vinegar, garlic, oil, salt and pepper. 
 Blend well with a wire whisk. 
 Crumble the cheese and add it into the dressing (which should be lumpy). 
 Pour the dressing over the tomatoes and onions, sprinkle with the fresh herbs and serve.
