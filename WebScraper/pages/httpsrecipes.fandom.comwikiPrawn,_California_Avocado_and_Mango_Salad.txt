 1 tsp  seeded mustard 
 3 tsp  lemon juice 
 1 tbsp chopped fresh  chives 
 1 tsp chopped  dill 
 Directions : 
 Prepare recipe close to serving time, it will not keep for long periods of time as the  avocado  will discolour, they will stay green longer if wiped with  lemon juice . 
 Cut  avocado 's in half lengthways, remove stone, remove flesh. 
 Shred  lettuce  and arrange a small pile in the middle of the plates. 
 Cut flesh of the  mangos , remove skin and slice both  avocado  and  mango , and arrange around the plate. 
 Sprinkle the prawns over, then the sliced  mushroom  last. 
 Mix all dressing ingredients together and liberally coat the prawns etc. 
 Sprinkle with chopped  parsley  and serve with brown bread and  butter . 
 This is a very nice light starter and the  raspberry vinegar  is a must, but can be replaced with other  vinegar .
