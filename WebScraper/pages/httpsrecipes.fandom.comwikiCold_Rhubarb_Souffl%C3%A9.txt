 Soften the  gelatin  in 2 tablespoons cold  water , then add to the hot  rhubarb  juice and stir until completely dissolved. Add the purée. 
 Beat the  cream  until stiff. 
 Beat the  egg whites  until they begin to stiffen, then add the remaining ½ cup  sugar  and the  vanilla , continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. 
 Fold first the eggwhite mixture into the  rhubarb , then the  whipped cream . Make a collar of wax paper and fit it around a 1½ quart soufflé mold. 
 Chill for at least six hours. Remove the collar and decorate the top with fresh  strawberries  and rosettes of  whipped cream  piped from a pastry tube.
