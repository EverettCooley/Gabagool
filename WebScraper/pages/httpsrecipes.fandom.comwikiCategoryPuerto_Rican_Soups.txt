 It is quite a popular practice in Puerto Rico for the traditional soups from the cuisine of Puerto Rico to be served at the beginning of the main course meal. The frijoles negros, (black-bean soup) is a popular soup that is served before the opening to any of the traditional Puerto Rican meal. A common soup in the cuisine of Puerto Rico is the sopón de pollo con arroz soup; this is chicken soup with rice in it.
