Description

       Kofta     
 Ingredients 
 1 cup fine fresh  breadcrumbs 
 1 lb lean  ground lamb 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  pepper 
 1 teaspoon ground  cumin 
 ½ teaspoon  allspice 
 1 teaspoon dried  mint 
 2 cloves  garlic 
 2 tablespoons  parsley 
 1  egg 
 1 tablespoon olive  oil 
 Directions 
 Make the bread crumbs by breaking up 2 slices of stale but not dried out whole wheat bread into the bowl of a food processor. 
 Whizz until finely crumbed. 
 Add the ground lamb and the egg, and process until blended. 
 Add the spices, garlic and parsley. 
 Process the meat well to achieve a fine texture. 
 Roll the mixture into small meatballs (I use a melon baller) or finger shaped patties using dampened hands. 
 You may cook them at once, or refrigerate the mixture for several hours (if your meat is very fresh, you can divide it in half and wrap part well in plastic for the next day's meal) 
 Heat the oil in a heavy skillet, and fry the balls or patties until cooked through and evenly browned. 
 The meatballs should be stirred several times, the patties turned once. 
 Remove them with a slotted spoon to drain. 
 Notes 
 Serve the meatballs hot or at room temperature as an appetizer. 
 Lovely with a yogurt or tahini sauce, 
 May be served on a bed of rice or in a pita.
