      Berkswell cheese     
 An English hard cheese that is produced from sheepâ€™s milk. The cheese is covered with a tough rind containing many ridges. The rind has a lanolin scent when it is fully aged to four months. The cheese has a chewy texture, which becomes increasingly hard as it ages. The flavor is similar to a combination of roasted nuts and onions.
