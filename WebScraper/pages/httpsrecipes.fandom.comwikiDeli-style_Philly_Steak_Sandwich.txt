 Description : 
       Deli-Style Philly Steak Sandwich     
 This deli-quick sandwich, reminiscent of the popular Philly  Steak  sandwich, is both colorful and very flavorful. Similar to the original cheesesteak, this traditional bread dish is made and packed with real cheese, vegetables, and roast beef, and is great for appetizers or side dishes, but the effort is worth it.

 ¼ cup Land o' Lakes®  butter 
 2 cups sliced  onions , red, white, or yellow only 
 1 medium (1 cup)  green  and/or  red bell pepper , cut into strips 
 ½ pound sliced deli roast  beef , cut into strips 
 4 hoagie or French rolls, split 
 8 (¾-ounce) slices Land o' Lakes® deli  American  or  provolone  cheese, cut in half 
 Directions : 
 Heat the broiler. Melt  butter  in a 10-inch skillet until sizzling; just add  onions  and  pepper  strips. 
 Cook over moderate heat until the  onion  is softened for 8 to 10 minutes. 
 Add  beef  strips; continue cooking until heated through (4 to 6 minutes). 
 Meanwhile, place split rolls onto the ungreased baking sheet, cut-side up. 
 Broil 2 to 5 inches from heat until light golden brown (1 to 2 minutes).
