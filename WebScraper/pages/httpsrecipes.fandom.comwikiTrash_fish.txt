      Trash fish     A term for fish that fishermen generally throw away because there's little or no commercial value. Trash fish that aren't discarded are generally used for the manufacture of chicken feed. Occasionally, trash fish make the transition from being detritus to being in demand, as in the case of lobster (long ago) and, more recently (primarily thanks to Julia Child),  Monkfish .
