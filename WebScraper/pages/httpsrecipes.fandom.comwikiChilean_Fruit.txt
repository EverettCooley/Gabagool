 ¼ cup  butter 
 2 cups  sour cream

 Dot with  butter  on top. 
 Cover and bake in a 350°F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the fruit and juice is nicely hot. 
 Serve hot, and pass the  sour cream  mixture to each person to top his or her portion. 
 Be sure to dip down to the bottom to get both the  cream  and the  brown sugar .
