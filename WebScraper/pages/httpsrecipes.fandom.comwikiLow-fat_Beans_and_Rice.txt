Description : 
 This recipe leaves a lot of leeway to add amounts to suit your tastes. I use about Â½ of a can of beans to 4 cups of cooked  rice . The kids love it and it adds a nice touch to bbq meals. Good way to use left over  rice  instead of turning it into fattening  rice  pudding. Make pl'nty...it goes fast! make sure the beans are well rinsed otherwise that nasty looking black liquid will spoil the appearance. It's a personal favorite of mine
 
 Ingredients : 
 brown or  white rice 
 canned  black beans 
 salsa , mild or medium 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  rice  (as you wish with amounts) in  water  according to directions with no seasoning ( butter ,  salt , etc). 
 Rinse the beans in a colander. 
 Mix the beans with the  rice . 
 Mix enough salsa with the  rice  and beans to make it colorful. 
 Serve over  lettuce  or alone.
