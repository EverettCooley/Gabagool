 About Soy cheese : 
 Soy cheese is a  cheese substitute  made from soybeans. Soy cheese is available in many of the same varieties as its dairy counterparts. This product is usually consumed due to certain dietary preferences, such as veganism, religious restrictions (most cheese analogues are kosher pareve, after approval of a Rabbi), lactose intolerance or milk allergies.
