 Makes 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons minced  shallots 
 2 cups fruity, not-too-tannic  red wine 
 2 tablespoons  balsamic  or  red wine vinegar 
 1½ to 2 pounds  salmon  fillet 
 salt and freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 stick  butter , cut into 6 or 8 pieces 
 chopped fresh  parsley  or  chervil  for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Combine shallots, wine and vinegar in a small saucepan and turn heat to high. 
 Cook until it is reduced to about ¼ cup, 10 minutes or so. 
 Meanwhile, put a nonstick skillet over medium heat; no fat is needed in pan. 
 Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper and place it, skin side up, in skillet. 
 Cook over medium-high heat until nicely browned, about 5 minutes, then turn. 
 When red wine mixture has reduced, turn heat to very low. 
 Add butter a piece at a time, stirring after each addition until it is incorporated. 
 When all butter has been added, taste and adjust seasoning. 
 Use a sharp knife to peek inside thickest part of fish to judge doneness. 
 When done to your liking, about 3 to 5 minutes after you turn, remove it to a platter or serving plates. 
 Spoon sauce over fish, garnish if you like, and serve.
