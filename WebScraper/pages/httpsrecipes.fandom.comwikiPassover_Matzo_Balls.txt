Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup  matzo meal 
 1 tbsp  potato starch 
 ⅓ cup  water  (scant) 
 1 pinch  salt 
 Directions : 
 Mix together and refrigerate ½ hour. 
 Roll into 8 balls and drop into boiling  vegetable broth  seasoned- water . 
 Turn down heat and boil gently for 20 minutes. 
 Remove from  water  with slotted spoon and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees on lightly PAM-sprayed cookie sheet. 
 They can be made ahead and refrigerated until use. 
 Do not put cold  matzo balls  into warm soup; warm them up first by dunking in hot  water . 
 Serve with  vegetable broth . 
 This makes very small  matzo balls , so plan on 3-4 per serving. 
 Roll into 16 balls. 
 Boil for 1 minute, then place on sprayed baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes at 400 °F. 
 If made that day, I don't think these need to be refrigerated.
