 Description : 
 I am not one for taking medication if I am sick unless it's really, really bad. I believe natural things like food, drinks, even interaction can cure many common illnesses. Right now, I have a pretty nasty cold, so my lovely Calvin has made me my favorite cure, extra spicy chicken soup. Here is the recipe for yourself, one bowl to cure the cold, doctors orders!
 
 Ingredients : 
 Chicken stock 
 Protein : 
 chicken  (or  tofu ) 
 Spices : 
 Be generous with  oregano 
 The sicker you are, the more  chili powder  you need. 
 Finishing Touches : 
 Enough to make it look pretty:  parsley 
 Hot sauce  (I use Asian `rooster` hot sauce) 
 Veggies : 
 Funion half of an  onion 
 A few stalks of  celery 
 A bit of  garlic 
 Carbs : 
 Rice  or  Pasta  (whatever you have) 
 Directions : 
 Brown the protein, add veggies, throw spices in, slowly add chicken stock, add finishing touches. Voila!
