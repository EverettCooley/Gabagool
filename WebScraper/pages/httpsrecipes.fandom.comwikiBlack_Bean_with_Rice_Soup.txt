Ingredients : 
 3 cups cooked  rice 
 32 oz canned  black beans  with their liquid (2 x 16 oz cans) 
 1 envelope ortega hot and spicy  taco seasoning  mix 
 4  green onions  and tops, chopped 
 46 oz canned  chicken broth , de-fatted 
 Â½ tsp ground  cumin 
 salt  to taste 
 pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Place the cooked  rice ,  black beans  with their liquid, the  taco seasoning  mix and the chopped  green onions  in a 6-quart Dutch oven over low heat. 
 Start to add  chicken broth , about a cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue in a like manner until the soup is of the desired consistency. 
 Season with  salt ,  pepper  and  cumin  to taste. 
 Continue to cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes. 
 Add more  chicken broth  as the  rice  tends to absorb the broth and it may become thicker than you like. You may add as much  chicken broth  as you desire, to obtain a soup-like consistency.
