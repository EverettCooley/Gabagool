I've been a lurker for awhile and have been following this topic with 
much interest. I have a Presto CHICKnFRYER low pressure fryer. It is a 
stove top unit, but being old-fashioned as I am stove tops are all I 
use. It is a 6 quart size and on the front of the receipe booklet it 
states that the regulator automatically maintains ideal LOW pressure 
for home frying. It is also for cokking veggies, meats & steamed 
desserts. I don't really know how old it is, but I bought it at a yard 
sale, still in it's original box and never used for $5.00. The date on 
the booklet is 1978 so there is no doubt that it is no longer 
manufactured. I don't use it much but it is really indispenable when I 
do need it. 
I want to thank everyone for all of the tips that I've gleaned from 
this list. Have a wonderful day all.
