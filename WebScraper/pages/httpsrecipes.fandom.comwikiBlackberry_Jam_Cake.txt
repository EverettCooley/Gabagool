Description : 
 Purchased from Zimmerman Estate in Terrell, Texas in 1989. Dated 1954. Recipe comes from a neighborhood block party. Notation on card says this came from a Metropolitan Cookbook in 1954. This cake is awesome. I have made it and will make it again and again. Took it to office and it was gobbled up……took another one the next day and was told bring it “every day”.
