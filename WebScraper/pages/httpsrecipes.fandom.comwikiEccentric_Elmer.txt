Description 
 The  Eccentric Elmer  is a relatively smooth bourbon cocktail, sweet with a hint of bitterness. Note that it is important to use cranberry juice cocktail, not cranberry juice. If cranberry juice cocktail is not available in your area, substitute cranberry juice and add 1 tbsp of superfine sugar to the drink before shaking.
