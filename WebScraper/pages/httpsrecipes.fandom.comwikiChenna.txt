A fresh, unripened cheese used throughout India, although it's most popular in the eastern part of the country. It is made from cow's or buffalo's milk and resembles a cottage cheese that has been kneaded until it's closer to the consistency of a light cream cheese. Chenna, which is available in Indian markets, used primarily in a variety of Bengali desserts.
