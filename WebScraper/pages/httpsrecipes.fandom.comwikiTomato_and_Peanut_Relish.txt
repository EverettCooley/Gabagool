Description : 
 Peanuts , known as groundnuts in Africa, are protein-rich and excellent for vegetarian dishes. Despite their name, they are really beans or legumes. They grew originally in South America but are now widely cultivated as a food and also as a cash crop in West Africa.  peanuts  have more or less displaced the African equivalent, the Bambara  groundnut .
 "This  tomato  and  groundnut  ( peanut ) relish is found in Zambia and Malawi and often has beans and  
other vegetables added to it.  peanuts  / groundnuts are commonly put into relishes when no meat is available." — Irene Wilkie, Edinburgh, UK.
