 Wash and cut  Beef  into bite sized pieces then rub with the Bajan Seasoning and  tomato   ketchup . Heat the  oil  in a skillet and stir-fry the meat for 10 minutes. Pour in the gravy  browning  and cook for another 5 minutes. 
 Add the  water , cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the  carrot  and  potatoes , adjust the seasonings with a little seasoned  salt , and cook for another 15 minutes. Add a little more  water  if necessary. The meat should be tender after 45 minutes of cooking but if not go a while longer. 
 Rice : 
 Place the  peas ,  salt pork  and the  thyme  in a pan with 4 cups  water  and bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until  Peas  are tender. 
 Wash and drain  rice  and add to the pan. Pour in enough  water  to just be level with the  rice  and  Peas  mixture. Bring to the boil then reduce heat to its lowest level, cover and simmer for about 20 minutes or until all the  water  has evaporated. 
 Rice  that has been soaked does not require a lot of liquid to cook and also the cooking time is reduced.
