      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Leftover cooking
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 decaying  peppers : one green, one red. 
 1 decaying  red onion 
 2 cooked  chicken  thighs from Safeway 
 1 decaying  carrot 
 2 ripe  tomatoes 
 2 ripe  sweetcorn  cobs from the Indian shop on the High Street 
 Directions : 
 Fry the  onions  and  carrots  first for a few minutes:
 
       Fry onion and carrot for a few minutes     
 Then add the chopped halves of green and red pepper. Thaw some pre-pulped  ginger ,  garlic  and chillie from the freezer and toss it in. Stir and fry for a few minutes - an then add the chopped and de-seeded  tomato :
 
         Add pepper and garlic,ginger and chillie     
         Add chopped tomatoes     
 Keep stirring this for a few more minutes - and then add the ground spices: 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 1 teaspoon haldi (tumeric), 1 teaspoon  salt , and 2 teaspoons  garam masala . Stir in and fry/roast until the aroma prevails - will take a few minutes - and then toss in the washed  basmati rice :
 
         Keep stirring     
         Add rice     
 After the  rice  has been stirred in - splash generously some  lemon juice  - and then stir it around - and then add 1.5 times the volume of  rice  of  water :
 
         Add a few drops of lemon juice     
         Add some water and then bring to boil     
 Let the mixture sizzle on high heat - and then add the cooked chopped  Chicken . And whilst that is all sizzling away - prepare a really low-flame burner on the hob:
 
         Add chopped chicken     
         Prepare low flame burner     
 
After the pot gets to a fierce boil - transfer to the low flame burner and simmer for 15 minutes. (DON’T TAKE THE LID OFF DURING THIS TIME!) And then afterwards - give it a gentle turning over before returning to the low flame:
 
         Simmer for 15 mins     
         Stir a little and then return to low flame     
 Whilst the  rice  mixture is simmering on its home run - prepare some fresh corn-on-the-cob for boiling and grilling. Right now -  Sweetcorn  cobs are approaching end-of-season - so you should be able to pick up  Sweetcorn  cobs for around 4 for £1 - anything more and you’re being ripped off! Asda are doing 2 for 50p at the moment - and your local Asian grocer will probably be doing 4 for under £1. Get them while you can!
 
 
         Prepare sweet corn     
         Chop each cob in two and then boil in pot     
 After boiling the corn-on-the-cobs for around 8 minutes - take out of pan and then sprinkle some  salt  and  pepper  on them - and skewer them with barbeque sticks - and then  butter  them all around generously before placing under a hot grill:
 
         Butter and season with salt and pepper     
         Grill on high heat for a few minutes each side     
 Grill the corn-on-the-cobs until you get golden brown edges to them - and then server up with the spicy-chicken- rice . It makes for a delicious meal. Wash down with some McGuigan Black Label  Merlot . Perfect for marking the end of Summer:
 
         Serve     
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
