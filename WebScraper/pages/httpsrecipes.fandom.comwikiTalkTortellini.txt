text from the merge page : 
 Tortellini is a ring-shaped pasta, they are typically stuffed with a mix of meat (pork loin, prosciutto crudo, mortadella) and parmesan cheese although other stuffings are popular in the Po Valley. Originally from the Italian region of Emilia (in particular Bologna and Modena), they are usually served in broth, with cream, or with a ragù or similar sauce. Traditionally, the most serious restaurant in Bologna as well "La Confraternita del Tortellino" agree that the only real Tortellino is served only in home made broth. Tortellino with cream is widely accepted in Bologna but criticized by some. Tortellino with ragù, although it can be found, is considered by the vast majority of Bolognesi to be non-authentic.
 Tortelloni is a larger version of tortellini, and is usually stuffed with Ricotta cheese and leaf vegetables, such as spinach.
