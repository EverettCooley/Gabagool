Ingredients : 
 2 cups  Asian-style Pickled Melons , drained (reserve ½ cup juice) 
 1 cup diagonally sliced  carrots 
 4  scallions , cut into 1-inch pieces 
 1 cup  snow peas , trimmed 
 1 lb flavored  tempeh 
 2 cups  vegetable oil  for deep-frying 
 3 tbsp  all-purpose flour 
 2 tbsp + 2 tsp  cornstarch 
 1 large  egg 
 3 tbsp club  soda water 
 2 tbsp  black sesame seeds 
 ½ cup juice from pickled melons 
 ¼ cup  water 
 ¼ tsp  sesame oil 
 1 tsp  hot chili oil 
 Directions : 
 Place pickled ,  carrots  and scallions in separate piles on plate, and set aside. 
 Halve snow  peas  on bias, and cut  tempeh  into ¼-inch-wide strips. 
 Set aside. 
 Heat  oil  in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. 
 Mix  flour  and 2 tablespoons  cornstarch  in small bowl. 
 Beat  egg  and  club soda  in second bowl. 
 Add to  flour  mixture. 
 Stir with chopsticks to just barely mix, leaving streaks of  flour . 
 Stir in  sesame seeds . 
 Place pickled juice,  water ,  sesame oil ,  chili oil  and remaining 2 teaspoons  cornstarch  in a third bowl. 
 Mix well, and set aside. 
 Dip  tempeh  strips in batter when  oil  reaches 375°F on a candy/fat thermometer, or when a dry bamboo chopstick held into  oil  causes rapid bubbling. 
 Deep-fry strips until golden, for 2 to 3 minutes, remove from  oil  and drain on paper towels. 
 Discard all but 2 tablespoons  oil  from wok, and stir-fry  carrots  over high heat for 1 minute. 
 Add remaining vegetables, and stir-fry for 2 minutes. 
 Stir pickle juice mixture again, and add to vegetables. 
 When sauce becomes clear, in about 30 seconds, add  tempeh , and toss. 
 Remove from heat, and serve while still hot.
