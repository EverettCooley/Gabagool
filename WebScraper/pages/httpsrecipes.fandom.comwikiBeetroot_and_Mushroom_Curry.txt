BEETROOT AND MUSHROOM CURRY 
 2 Tbsp canola oil 
1 tsp cumin seeds 
1 tsp brown mustard seeds 
225 g (1/2 lb) mushrooms, halved lengthways 
450 g (1 lb) beetroot - peeled and cut in 2 cm (3/4 in) dice 
1-1/2 Tbsp grated ginger root 
2-3 crushed garlic cloves, finely chopped 
2 fresh thai green chilies 
1/2 pint (1 cup) canned tomato sauce/puree salt to taste 
 Set your pan over medium heat, pour in oil, and when hot add the seeds. When mustard seeds pop (stand back!) add mushrooms, stir, then add beetroot, ginger, garlic and chillies, stir and cook for two or three minutes. 
 Add tomato puree, 1 cup (half pint) water and around 1/2 tsp salt or to taste. Stir and when mixture comes to a boil, cover the pan and lower the heat to simmer for about 45 minutes or until the beetroot is done.
