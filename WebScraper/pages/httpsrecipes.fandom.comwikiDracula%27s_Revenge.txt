 Yield: 10 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 2 whole  garlic  heads 
 1 pound sweet  turkey Italian sausage 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh or ¼ teaspoon dried  sage 
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh or ¼ teaspoon dried  rosemary 
 2 tablespoons  butter  or stick  margarine 
 ⅓ cup  all-purpose flour 
 6 cups 1%  low-fat milk 
 1 cup (4 ounces) grated fresh  Parmesan cheese 
 ⅔ cup (about 2½ ounces) shredded  gruyère  or  Swiss cheese 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ⅛ teaspoon  black pepper 
 8 cups hot cooked  penne  (about 1 pound uncooked tube-shaped pasta) or rigatoni 
 cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Remove white papery skin from garlic heads (do not peel or separate the cloves). 
 Wrap each head separately in foil. Bake at 350F for 1 hour; cool 10 minutes. 
 Separate cloves; squeeze to extract garlic pulp. Discard skins. Set garlic aside. 
 Increase oven temperature to 400°F. 
 Remove casings from sausage. Cook sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, stirring to crumble. 
 Remove from pan with a slotted spoon. 
 Place sausage in a large bowl; stir in sage and rosemary. 
 Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Add the flour to melted butter, stirring with a whisk. 
 Gradually add the milk; cook until slightly thick, stirring constantly with a whisk (about 10 minutes). 
 Stir in roasted garlic, cheeses, salt, and pepper. Remove mixture from heat. 
 Add 5½ cups cheese sauce and cooked pasta to sausage, stirring to coat. 
 Spoon pasta mixture in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. 
 Top with remaining sauce. 
 Bake at 400°F for 15 minutes or until thoroughly heated.
