 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  dried apricots 
 1 qt.  apricot  juice 
 8 Tbs.  agar-agar  flakes 
 2 tsp. ground  cinnamon 
 1 tsp. ground  allspice 
 1 tsp. grated  nutmeg 
 1/2 tsp. ground cloves 
 3 cups  soy milk 
 4 Tbs. kudzu 
 1 cup  maple syrup 
 1/4 cup  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Soak  apricots  in 2 cups  apricot  juice for 15 minutes. Pour remaining 2 cups juice in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Stir in  agar  flakes and allow to sit for 10 minutes.
 
 Meanwhile, in large skillet, combine  apricots  with soaking juice,  cinnamon ,  allspice ,  nutmeg , and cloves. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring often, 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
 
 Bring  agar  mixture to slow simmer over low heat and simmer until flakes are dissolved. Add  soy milk , stirring often to prevent it from burning.
 
 In a small bowl, dissolve kudzu in 1/4 cup  water . When the kudzu is completely dissolved, whisk it into  soy milk  mixture. Add  maple syrup  and  vanilla extract .
 
 In food processor, process  apricots  until smooth. Add to soy mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Transfer pudding to a shallow casserole, bring to room temperature, then refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
 
 When ready to serve, process mixture in a food processor until smooth. Serve in parfait glasses with a dollop of  tofu   cream  (see recipe below) if desired.
