A variety of highly refined flour with the bran and the germ removed, but without chemical bleaching, thus eliminating the majority of nutrients in the flour. What remains after being refined is the inner portion of the wheat kernel known as the endosperm. Therefore, it is commonly combined with whole wheat flour to improve the nutrition in the food product. It is a highly versatile flour used often for breads, cakes, cookies, pastries, and other baked goods.
