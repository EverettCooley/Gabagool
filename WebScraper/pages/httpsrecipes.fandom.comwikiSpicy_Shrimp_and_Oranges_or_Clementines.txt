 Makes 4 servings. 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ pounds peeled  shrimp 
 ½ to 1 canned  chipotle chile  in  adobo sauce , minced 
 ½ teaspoon  sugar  or  substitute 
 2 large navel  oranges  or 4  clementines , peeled and sectioned 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 3 tablespoons  lime juice 
 1 tablespoon  oil 
 ½ cup  cilantro , chopped 
 Directions : 
 Toss the shrimp with the minced chipotle (use ½ of the chile for mild heat and a whole one for more fiery flavor) and sugar; set aside. 
 Toss the oranges or clementines with the cumin and lime juice. 
 Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high. 
 Add the shrimp in a single layer, taking care not to crowd the pan. If necessary, use 2 skillets. 
 Cook the shrimp until they are lightly browned on the undersides, about 2 minutes. 
 Turn them over and then place the orange sections on top of the shrimp. 
 After 2 minutes, when the shrimp are seared on the undersides, toss the mixture and continue cooking 1 more minute, or until the orange pieces are softened and have released juices into the pan. 
 Remove from the heat, stir in the cilantro and serve.
