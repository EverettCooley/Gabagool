 2½ tablespoons  sugar 
 1 clove  garlic , peeled and bruised 
 1 small hot  chili pepper , slit open, seeds removed

 Place all the ingredients in a saucepan over a high heat. 
 Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for about 20 minutes. 
 Remove any scum that rises to the surface. 
 Increase the heat, turning the drumsticks frequently in the sauce, and cook until the liquid has reduced to a sticky glaze. 
 Arrange the  chicken  on a serving platter, remove the  garlic  clove and  chile  from the liquid, and spoon the glaze over.
