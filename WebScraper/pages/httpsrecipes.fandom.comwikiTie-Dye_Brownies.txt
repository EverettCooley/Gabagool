 Ingredients: : 
 1 ¾ cups graham cracker crumbs 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
 ½ teaspoon vanilla 
 1 bag (20 oz) brownie mix 
 1 egg 
 ½ cup canola oil 
 ¼ cup water 
 1 ½ cups white chocolate chips 
 ½ can (7 oz) sweetened condensed milk 
 1/3 cup marshmallow fluff 
 1 tablespoon butter 
 Food coloring 
 Instructions: : 
 Preheat oven to 325 F. Line an 8×8 inch baking pan with foil, leaving additional foil to hang over the sides. Spray bottom and sides of foiled pan with nonstick baking spray. Set aside. 
 Prepare graham cracker crust. In a small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted unsalted butter, and vanilla. Press firmly into prepared baking pan. 
 In a medium bowl, combine egg, canola oil, and water. Stir to combine. Add brownie mix and stir to combine. Pour and spread into baking pan on top of graham cracker crust.Bake for 40-45 minutes. 
 Ten minutes before brownies have finished cooking, begin preparing white chocolate marshmallow fudge. Microwave white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl on 50% power until 90% melted, about 2 minutes. Check multiple times during microwave process to make sure you do no over-microwave. Stir until smooth and completely melted. Stir in marshmallow fluff. 
 Working quickly, divide microwaved fudge into 7 bowls. Make red, yellow, green, blue, orange, and purple colored fudge by adding drops of food coloring and stirring to your desired boldness. Leave one bowl uncolored. 
 Remove brownies from oven. While still hot, drop colored fudge by spoonful directly onto hot brownies. Swirl with a bamboo stick or toothpick to create tie-dye effect. 
 Refrigerate until completely set, which will be at least 4 hours or overnight. To serve, remove from baking pan using foil overhang. Use a sharp knife to cut, rinsing between each cut.
