 Some of the common ingredients in Liberian vegetarian cooking include cassavas, hot red peppers, sweet potatoes and yams, tomatoes, plantains, greens, okra, coconut, pumpkin, mangoes, ginger and eggplant. A great vegetarian recipe is represented by the sweet potato pone, which includes grated raw potatoes, dark cane syrup, ground ginger, salt and vegetable oil. Plantains are usually consumed simple and fried, like the dish called fried plantains. The plantains are cut in six uniform pieces and then fried in vegetable oil in a saut√© pan. If the plantains are not available, the green bananas are also a good option. A sweet vegetarian option is represented by the plantain gingerbread, made of sugar, ripe plantain, flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and margarine. Plain rice or served with tomatoes paste is also eaten a lot by the Liberian vegetarians. Kanyah is a sweet vegetarian snack, made only of 3 ingredients: roasted peanuts, uncooked rice or rice flour and sugar.
