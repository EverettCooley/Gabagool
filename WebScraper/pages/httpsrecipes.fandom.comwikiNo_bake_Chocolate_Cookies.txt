I got this recipe from a hand written PTA fundraiser cookbook from
Vermont. I picked it up in an antique shop in a cute little town
called Waitsfield. Lots of old fashioned awesome recipes.
This one you make in a double boiler.
 1/2 cup milk
2 cups sugar
4 TBS cocoa
1/4 lb of butter
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup peanut butter
3 cups quick cook oatmeal
 Combine milk, sugar, cocoa,butter and vanilla in the top of a double
boiler. Boil together for 15 minutes. Then add the peanut butter, mix
until creamy. Add quick cook oatmeal. Beat until thick enough to drop
by teaspoonfulls on cookie sheet. Cool - serve - enjoy!
