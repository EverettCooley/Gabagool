 Ingredients : 
 ¾ oz Espresso Coffee (hot) 
 ¾ oz Galliano 
 Whipped Cream 
 Nutmeg (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Layer in a shooter glass in the following order:
 
 Pour Espresso Coffee first. 
 Using a teaspoon, hold it at a slant above coffee, without touching it. Gently and slowly pour the Galliano onto the spoon so it seeps past the coffee on the side of the shooter glass. If done properly, Galliano will seep to the bottom creating a layered effect (see photo). 
 Top with Whipped Cream 
 Optional, you can sprinkle a dash of nutmeg on top. 
 Serve it as a shot drink.
