Description : 
 Before  potatoes  became popular,  cod  chowder was prepared with  salt pork ,  cod  and hard tack all boiled together. For variety, add fresh  corn  in season with the  potatoes  and  carrots .
 A chowder is a style of stew or soup that bears no resemblance to the main dish of either "fisherman's or and brewis". Vary rarely do you see  corn  or  carrots  used like this in old Nfld. cooking. Another treatment to this would be a  cream  sauce made from  cream / milk ,  butter , and  flour  - great over the  potatoes  and .
 The "fisherman's brewis" came from the men out fishing who would use only one pot and have all the ingredients cooking at one time to save on time and fuel. Once cooked they would stir it all together and thus "fisherman's brewis".
