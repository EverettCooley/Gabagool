Ingredients : 
         
 2 strips  bacon  (cut into 1 in pieces) 
 Â¼ cup  kimchi  (drained and chopped) 
 2  tortillas 
 2 handfuls  cheese  (grated, I used a combination of  cheddar  and  jack ) 
 Directions : 
 Cook the bacon and set aside retaining the grease. 
 Saute the kimchi in the bacon grease until it starts to caramelize, about 10 minutes. 
 Melt a touch of butter in a pan. 
 Place a tortilla into the pan and swirl around in the butter and set aside. 
 Place the second tortilla into the pan and swirl around in the butter. 
 Sprinkle on half of the cheese onto the tortilla followed by the kimchi and bacon followed by the remaining cheese. 
 Cook until the quesadilla is golden brown on both sides and the cheese is melted.
