      Yugoslavian Burek (Borek)     
 Description : 
 Yugoslavian  börek , or burek is a baked or fried filled pastry
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil 
 1 medium  yellow onion , peeled and chopped 
 1 pound  ground beef 
 1 teaspoon  allspice 
 2 teaspoons Hungarian  paprika 
 salt  and freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 box  phyllo  pastry sheet (12 inches x 17 inches) 
 ¾ cup  butter , melted 
 Directions : 
 Heat a large frying pan and add the  oil . 
 Sauté the  onion  until soft, and then add the  beef , spices, and  salt  and  pepper  to taste. 
 Cook until the meat is crumbly but not dry. Cool completely before you continue. 
 Lay 1 sheet of  phyllo dough  on the counter. Brush with some of the  butter . 
 Place a heaping ⅓ cup of meat mixture across the sheet along the long side, 2 inches from edge. 
 Fold the bottom over the meat mixture and roll into a snake shape. Cut the roll in half and coil each roll into a snail shape. 
 Place on a nonstick baking sheet and butt the end up against the edge of the pan to prevent uncoiling. Brush with additional  butter . 
 Bake in a preheated oven at 375 °F for 15 to 20 minutes or until just golden. 
 Keep the remaining sheets of  phyllo dough  covered with plastic, and work quickly to prevent in from drying out. 
 Notes : 
 Hint on handling  phyllo dough : Be sure the dough is at room temperature before you open the box. Place the sheets of dough on a large cookie sheet and cover them with plastic wrap and then a heavy towel. In this way, they will not dry out while you are working with them. Work fast for best results and do not have the  butter  too hot when brushing the dough.
