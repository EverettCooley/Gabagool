About microwave oven : 
       Microwave     
 A microwave ovenÂ is a small, electrical oven that uses microwaves to cook or warm up food. Microwaves are the electromagnetic radiations that are of wavelength between 1 mm and 30 cm, used to cook food, for scientific studies of the environment, and to send and receive messages from orbits around the Earth.
 Things have evolved with the rise in use of microwave ovens, also known as microwave oven such as recommended cooking times reduced because it now takes less time to cook certain foods in a microwave compared to the traditional oven. Two main models of traditional ovens include the counter top and the space saver. The "space saver" model has a fan beneath it and is fixed on a stove with a vent to evacuate cooking fumes.
 Microwaves are very efficient because of the less time it takes to cook food which ultimately leads to less power consumed.
