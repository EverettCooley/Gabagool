       Deep-fried Bananas with Caramel Sauce     
 Ingredients : 
 4  bananas 
 1/2 cup  hazelnuts , toasted and finely chopped 
 1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs 
 vegetable oil 
 Sauce:
 
 1 1/2 tablespoons  butter 
 1 cup  brown sugar 
 4 tablespoons  water 
 1 1/4 cups  coconut milk 
 Directions : 
 Peel the  bananas  and cut them in half lengthways, then half again, so that you have long strips. 
 Mix the  hazelnuts  and breadcrumbs in a bowl and roll the  banana  pieces in it. 
 Press some of the mixture into the flesh to make sure it is well coated. 
 Heat all the sauce ingredients in a small heavy sauce pan, stirring constantly. 
 Heat the  oil  in a wok to 180 degrees Celsius. 
 How much  oil  you use is relevant to how big your wok is. 
 Put enough so it will cover the  bananas , but never fill it more than halfway. 
 Deep fry the  bananas  in batches for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. 
 Place the fried  bananas  on a piece of paper towel on a place to let the  oil  drain. 
 To serve, place the  bananas  on a plate and pour some caramel sauce over top.
