 1 cup  barley  — not quick-cooking

 Directions : 
 Salad : 
 In a kettle combine the  black beans  with enough cold  water  to cover them by 2 inches, simmer them, covered, for 1 hour, or until they are tender, and drain them well. 
 While the beans are cooking, in a large saucepan combine the  barley  with 4 cups boiling salted  water  and simmer it, covered, for 45 minutes, or until it is cooked but still al dente. 
 Drain the  barley  in a colander, rinse it, and drain it well. 
 In a small bowl whisk together the  lemon juice , the  mustard , and  salt  and  pepper  to taste, add the  oil  in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. 
 In a large bowl combine the  black beans , the  barley , and the  onion , add the dressing, and toss the salad until it is combined well. 
 The salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. 
 In a saucepan of boiling salted  water  cook the  green beans  for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are just tender, refresh them under cold  water , and drain them well. 
 Cut the beans crosswise into ¼-inch pieces, add them to the salad with  pine nuts  and  salt  and  pepper  to taste, and toss the salad until it is combined well. 
 Serve the salad chilled or at room temperature. 
 Quick soaking the dried beans : 
 In a colander rinse the beans under cold  water  and discard any discolored ones. 
 In a kettle combine the beans with enough cold  water  to cover them by 2 inches, bring the  water  to a boil, and boil the beans for 2 minutes. 
 Remove the kettle from the heat and let the beans soak, covered, for 1 hour. 
 Enjoy.
