Ingredients : 
 7 large  eggs  separated keep at room temperature 
 1⅓ cup  sugar 
 3 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1 tbsp grated  orange rind 
 4 very ripe  bananas , mashed (about 1⅓ cups) 
 1 cup  matzah cake meal 
 1 cup coarsely  ground almonds 
 1 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, with an electric mixer beat the yolks and they are thick and pale. 
 Gradually add the  sugar , beating until the mixture is very thick. 
 Beat in the  lemon juice  and the rind, add the  bananas , the matzah cake meal, the  almonds  and the  salt  and beat the mixture until it is combined well. 
 In a clean dry bowl, with clean dry beater beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks, stir 1 cup of them into the  banana  mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly. 
 Pour the batter into an ungreased 9" tube pan (3 ½" deep) with a removable bottom and bake the torte in the middle of a preheated 350 °F oven for 55–60 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. 
 Invert the pan over the neck of a bottle and let the torte cool upside down. 
 Run a thin knife around the edge and tube of the pan and remove the side of the pan. 
 Run the knife under the bottom of the torte to release it and transfer the torte carefully with 2 spatulas to a serving plate.
