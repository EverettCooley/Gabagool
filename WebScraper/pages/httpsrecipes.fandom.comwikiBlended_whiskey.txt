 Wikipedia Article  About Blended whiskey on Wikipedia 
 A blended whiskey (or whisky) is the product of blending different types of whiskies. It is generally the product of mixing one or more single malt whiskies (made from 100 percent malted grain (such as barley or rye) together with other grain whiskies or neutral grain spirits. Scotland, Ireland, and Canada are the most common countries of origin for blends.
 Most blended whiskies do not list an age. When a blended scotch whisky does so, each individual malt and grain whisky must be at least as old as the age listed.
 A blended whisky is much less expensive to produce than the other types of whisky. Most cocktails and mixed drinks that call for whisky use blended whisky.
