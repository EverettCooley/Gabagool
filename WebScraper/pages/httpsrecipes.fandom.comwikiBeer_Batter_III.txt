Description : 
 Beer ! whether it's  ale ,  lager ,  pilsener , or  stout , is terrific for cooking.  Beer  makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French  onion  soup. And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy Vancouver weekend out on the boat fishing for spring salmon than a cold  beer  with a hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown  beer   mustard ?
 Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with  flour , dip into the batter, and fry in  oil  at 360 °F.
until done. However, James "missed the boat" on this one - itis far better for deep frying  halibut , cod, or any other seafood. The batter puffs up because of the  beer 's  yeast , fries quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the cardinal sin of seafood preparation - overcooking. I think few of our piscine friends benefit from deep frying as a cooking method, but that's another story.
