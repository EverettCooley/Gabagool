 Ingredients : 
 6  orange 
 1/4 cup  Sugar 
 1 cup  water 
 1/8 cup  corn syrup 
 2 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1/4 cup  Grand Marnier 
 Directions : 
 Using zester or vegetable peeler, peel thin strips of  orange  rind from 2 of the  oranges , being careful not to include any white part. Cut into wispy thin strips and place in saucepan. Pour in enough cold  water  to cover and bring to boil (this removes any  bitter  flavor); drain and set aside. Using sharp knife, cut peel, including any white pith and membrane, from  oranges . Cut  oranges  into round slices and place in glass bowl or in overlapping slices on platter. In saucepan, combine  Sugar ,  water  and  corn syrup ; bring to boil, stirring only until  Sugar  has dissolved. Add strips of  orange  rind; simmer uncovered, for 25 minutes or until syrup is slightly thickened. Remove from heat; stir in  lemon juice  and liqueur. Let cool, then pour sauce over  oranges . Refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours, turning  oranges  once or twice. Taste and add more liqueur if desired.
