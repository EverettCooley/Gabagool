 Description : 
 Adapted from  How to Cook Meat  by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby.  Flank  or  round steak  can be used instead of the  skirt steak .
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs  skirt steak 
 1 cup fresh  lime juice  (about 8  limes ) 
 For the Rub : 
 3 tablespoons  cumin seeds  ( or  1½ tablespoons ground  cumin ) 
 2½ tablespoons minced  garlic 
 ⅓ cup roughly chopped fresh  cilantro 
 kosher salt  and freshly cracked  black pepper 
 For the Relish : 
 ½ cup finely chopped pitted  green olives 
 1 teaspoon chopped dried red  chili peppers , of your choice to taste 
 ¼ cup  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons freshly cracked  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Place the  steak  in a shallow dish and pour the  lime juice  over it. 
 Cover the dish and let it stand in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning occasionally. 
 Light up a fire in your grill. 
 In a small bowl, combine all the rub ingredients and mix well. 
 Remove the  steak  from the marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and rub it all over with the spice rub, pressing gently to be sure it sticks. 
 When the fire has died down and the coals are hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches from the grill surface for 1 to 2 seconds), place the  steak  on the grill and cook until well-seared on one side, about 4 minutes. 
 Turn and continue to cook to the desired doneness, about 4 minutes more for rare. 
 To check for doneness: make a ¼-inch cut in the thickest part of the meat and take a peek; it should be slightly less done than you like it. 
 Remove the  steak  from the heat, cover it loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes while you make the relish. 
 In a medium bowl, combine all the relish ingredients and mix well. 
 Slice the  steak  as thin as possible against the  grain  and serve with the relish. 
 Enjoy!
