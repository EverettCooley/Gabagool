 Ingredients : 
 1/4th block of extra  firm tofu , excess  water  removed and crumbled 
 1/2 -- 1 tablespoon extra virgin  olive oil 
 salt  &  pepper  to taste 
 1/2  avocado 
 two slices of  tomato , I prefer roma 
 chopped veggies of choiceâ€”I use the following: 
 1/2  green pepper 
 approx. 1/4 cup vidalia  Onion 
 3 button  Mushrooms 
 1 small can of  black olives 
 soya cheese , optional 
 Directions : 
 Saute the crumbled  tofu  in half of the  olive oil  with  salt  and  pepper  until browned. Meanwhile, toast the  bagel . Spread each toasted  bagel  half with the  avocado . Place  tomato  slices on each  bagel  half. When  tofu  is brown, add chopped  peppers ,  Onion  and  Mushrooms . This is when you may need to add more  olive oil . However, remember,  Mushrooms  are mostly  water  and will add to the saute juices in the pan. When  peppers  are tender,  onions  are glossy and  Mushrooms  are sauted; heap  tofu /veggie mixture on to  bagel  halves. Top with  black olives . If you are using  soya cheese , place a slice on each half and broil until the  Cheese  has melted. Serve at once.
