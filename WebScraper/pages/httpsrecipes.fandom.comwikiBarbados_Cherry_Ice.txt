 Description : 
 The key stone-cold ingredients for this beverage are the cherries, water, and sugar. This ice-cold Barbadian beverage is great with other fruits for garnishing and delivers a rich, icy aroma that it relishes. Apple juice sometimes works for this too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 lbs.  cherries 
 4 oz.  water 
 sugar , white or brown only, to taste 
 3 tablespoons apple juice, optional 
 Directions : 
 Squeeze out the seeds from the  cherries , which should give about 2 pints of pulp and juice. 
 Add the  water  and apple juice (if desired), sweeten to taste, and freeze. Serve cold with other fruits but pour or scoop the contents into a beer mug or a highball glass with ice cubes.

 Servings:  3 cups or 6 glasses
