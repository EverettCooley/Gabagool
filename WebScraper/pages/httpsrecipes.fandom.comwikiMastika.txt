 Mastika (Macedonian: мастика; Romanian: mastică ; Bulgarian: мастика) is an anise-flavored liqueur popular in the Southern Balkans, and is considered the national drink of Macedonia. It contains 45% alcohol, has a fiery taste not unlike that of brandy and is usually made from grapes, raisins, plums or figs. Mastika turns White when poured over ice. Also when put in the freezer little crystals form in the drink.
 In Macedonia it is usually poured over ice and enjoyed with Meze.
 In Bulgaria it is often combined with Menta, a mint liqueur, to make a traditional cocktail called 'Cloud' (Bulgarian: облак).
 And in Romania it is used as a wedding toast, where it often is thought of as a good accompaniment to traditional chicken dishes.
