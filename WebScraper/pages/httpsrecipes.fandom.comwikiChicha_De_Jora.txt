 Description : 
       Chicha De Jora     
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb (4 full cups) Maiz de Jora purchased or homemade 
 2 x 15-oz cakes chancaca (OR) 
 1 cup  white sugar  and 
 2 cup  brown sugar , packed 
 +additional for sweetening 
 8 whl cloves 
 1 x Dried hot  chili pepper 
 1 x Fresh stalk (about 36") 
 Sugarcane (1-1/2 lbs) cut into pieces, crushed 
 1 x  lemon , sliced for garnish 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a stainless-steel stockpot large enough to hold 2-1/2 gallons of liquid, combine the jora, chancaca or sugars, cloves,  pepper , and crushed sugarcane with 8 quarts of cold  water . 
 Allow to soak for 1 hour. 
 Place over high heat and bring to boil, stirring now and then with a wooden spoon and *scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent sticking and burning. 
 When the mixture comes to a full boil, lower the heat and gently simmer, covered, for 4-1/2 hours, stirring now and then. 
 Remove from heat and allow to rest for about 2 hours undisturbed. 
 Pour through a strainer. 
 Press liquid from the  sugar cane  and discard the pulp. 
 Strain the mixture again through a double layer of cheesecloth into a ceramic, porcelain, or glass container and store in a dark, cool place, covered tightly with cheesecloth or a kitchen towel. 
 Allow to sit from 3 to 8 days, depending on how strong and how thick you want the chicha to be. 
 The longer the chicha sits, the higher the alcohol content and the thicker it will get.
