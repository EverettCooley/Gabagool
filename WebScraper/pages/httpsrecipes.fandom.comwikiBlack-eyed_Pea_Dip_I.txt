 Suggested Uses : 
 This recipe may be used as a filling for  celery  sticks or a dip for raw vegetable pieces. We usually make more than we need for our initial serving so that there will be some left over in the refrigerator for a snack. 
 We enjoy it on our baked  potatoes ; or diluted slightly with  water , we add this black eye pea dip to a large tossed salad with chunks of baked  Potato  for a “one-bowl” meal. 
 You may find other uses for this delicious, versatile dip.
