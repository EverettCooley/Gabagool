Ingredients : 
 1 litre long life  (UHT) full cream milk 
 1 litre long life  (UHT) single cream 
 1 cup natural  yogurt 
 1 can  sweetened condensed milk 
 1 cup  sugar 
 Directions : 
 That's it, mix them together ( no need to boil and cool the  milk  ) and put the mix in the oven at very low temperature for 6 hours. 
 By trial and error you will find the correct temperature setting for your oven for the perfect doiÂ ! if it's not setting, up the temperature a bit. 
 Let me break the myth about gamcha bandha doi. 
 Any doi, if it does not set firm, put it on a gamcha like cloth and hang over a sink to drain for 6 hours. 
 There you go, enjoy your gamcha bandha doi - nice and firm.
