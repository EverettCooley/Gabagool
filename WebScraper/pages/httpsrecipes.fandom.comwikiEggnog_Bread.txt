Description : 
 I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my breadmaker for the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what i did; you may need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with it, if it looks too sticky, add  flour  (1 tbsp. at a time). If too dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!! 
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  sugar 
 1 pack  active dry yeast 
 2½ cup  all purpose flour 
 2 tbsp  butter 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp  nutmeg 
 ¾ cup  eggnog , at room temp. (maybe as little as ½ cup) 
 Directions : 
 Place ingredients in the breadmaker according to your manufacturers' directions. 
 Then adjust by adding  flour  or liquid as needed this made a real moist, light lg loaf. 
 I used the sweet bread cycle and turned the lightness or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark.
