 1 Large Ripe  avocado 
 2/3 c Low-Fat  cottage cheese  (you Can Use Non-Fat For an Even Lighter Version) 
 1  green onion , Finely Chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , Minced or Pressed 
 2 t Fresh  lemon  or  lime juice 
 1 Tsp. Minced Jalapeño (more or Less to Taste)

Slice  avocado  in Half, Lengthwise And Remove The Pit. Remove Flesh From Peel And Place in Food Processor With Remaining Ingredients. Puree Until Smooth.
