 About mayonnaise : 
 Mayonnaise (sometimes abbreviated to mayo) is a stable emulsion of  oil  and either  vinegar  or  lemon juice , with many options for embellishment with other herbs and spices. The  egg yolk  is the traditional emulsifier. It is often cream in color, and may be anything in texture from that of light running cream through thick. In countries influenced by France, the mustard is also a common ingredient, whereas in Spain it is made using the same ingredients, but specifically olive oil as the oil, and never with mustard. Numerous other sauces can be created from it with the addition of various herbs, spices, and finely chopped pickles. Where mustard is used, it is also an emulsifier.
