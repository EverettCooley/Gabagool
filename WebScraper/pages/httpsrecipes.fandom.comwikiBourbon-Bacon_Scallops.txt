 Description : 
 This seafood-based skewer is made with bourbon whiskey and real bacon, enriched with Dijon mustard, and grilled to red-hot perfection.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 3 tbsp minced  green onions 
 2 tbsp.  bourbon  whiskey 
 2 tbsp.  maple syrup 
 1 tbsp. low-sodium  soy sauce 
 1 tbsp.  Dijon mustard 
 ¼ tsp.  pepper 
 24 large sea  scallops  (about 1½-pounds) 
 6 low-sodium  bacon  slices (4-ounces) 
 cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl; stir well. 
 Add  scallops , stirring gently to coat. 
 Cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
 Remove  scallops  from bowl, reserving marinade. Cut each slice of  bacon  into 4 pieces. 
 Wrap 1  bacon  piece around each  scallop  (the  bacon  might only wrap halfway around  scallops  if they are very large). 
 Thread  scallops  onto 4 (12-inch) skewers, leaving some space between  scallops  so  bacon  will cook. 
 Place skewers on a broiler pan coated with  cooking spray ; broil 8 minutes or until  bacon  is crisp and  scallops  are done, basting occasionally with reserved marinade (cooking time will vary greatly with the size of  scallops ). Serve hot and plain with rice or with any side dish, main dish, or appetizer.
