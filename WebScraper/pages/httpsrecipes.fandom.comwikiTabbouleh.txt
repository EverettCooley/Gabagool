 Cook Time : 30 minutes 
 Serves : 4 
 Ingredients 
 
 1 cup  bulgur wheat 
 1 cup hot  water 
 3 cups fresh  flat leaf parsley , chopped 
 4  scallions 
 3  lemons 
 1  garlic  clove 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp  pepper 
 ¾ cup diced  tomatoes 
 Directions 
 Put the bulgur in a medium bowl with 1 cup of hot water. The bulgur will absorb the water. 
 Wash the parsley in a colander under running water. Roll the herbs in paper towels to dry. 
 Wash the scallions and pat dry. On a cutting board, cut off the roots and slice the white portion into ¼ –inch slices. Finely chop the slices and discard the green tops. 
 Roll the lemons on a flat surface to loosen the membranes. 
 Cut the lemons in half. Squeeze each lemon half over a measuring cup until you have ½ cup of juice. Remove seeds. 
 Peel the papery skin off the garlic clove. Slice the garlic with a paring knife and mince. 
 Combine the scallions, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and whisk together. Fold the lemon juice mixture into the bulgur with a spoon. Add the tomatoes and continue stirring until well combined.
