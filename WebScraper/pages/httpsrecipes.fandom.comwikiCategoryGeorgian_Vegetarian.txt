 The Georgian cuisine displays recipes that are based on vegetables and fruits, and which fit very well the diet of vegetarians. Many types of fruits are used. Among these, walnuts have the greatest popularity. Also, cabbage and beans are typical ingredients for these dishes. The Georgians have developed many variations of their well known salad called lobio. Some of the variations seem to be especially created for those that do not consume ingredients and foods of animal provenience. It is good to know that the vegetarian foods cover all the Georgian cuisine, since there are appetizers, salads, soups and desserts based exclusively on vegetables and desserts that either consist of or are made from fruits.
