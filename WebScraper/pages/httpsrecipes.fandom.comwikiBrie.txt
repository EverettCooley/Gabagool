 Wikipedia Article  About Brie on Wikipedia 
 Brie is a soft cow's milk cheese named after Brie, the French province in which it originated (roughly corresponding to the modern d√©partement of Seine-et-Marne). It is pale in color with a slight greyish tinge under crusty white mould; very soft and savoury with a hint of ammonia. The white mouldy rind is tasteless and edible.
 There are now many varieties of Brie made all over the world, including plain Brie, herbed varieties,double and triple brie and versions of Brie made with other types of milk. Brie is perhaps the most well-known French cheese, and is popular throughout the world. Despite the variety of Bries, the French government officially certifies only two types of Brie to be sold under that name: Brie de Meaux (shown to the right) and Brie de Melun.
