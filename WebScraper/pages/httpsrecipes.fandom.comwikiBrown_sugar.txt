 About Brown sugar : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Brown sugar on Wikipedia 
 Brown sugar is an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals combined with molasses. Brown sugar is produced similarly to white sugar, with two exceptions. Its crystals are left much smaller than for white sugar, and the syrup or molasses is not washed off completely. Brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses ( light brown sugar ) to 6.5% molasses ( dark brown sugar ).
 Store sugar indefinitely in an airtight container.
