 The foorah is a special and simple recipe of a sweet meal, which is consumed as a dessert or a snack. The recipe includes only rice flour, sugar and water and the result is a thick paste, with optional milk addition, which is served cold. Other special desserts, which are famous in all African countries are the kokeksisters, prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, mixed spices, butter and yeast fat for frying and the kolombyntjes, with sugar, butter, eggs, flour, tartar cream, milk and lime juice. The cakes are sometimes even more flavored with additional syrup, made of water, sugar and cinnamon.
