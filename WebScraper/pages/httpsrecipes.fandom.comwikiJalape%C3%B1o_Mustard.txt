 Description : 
 A red-hot, savory combination of real mustard, and jalapeños is made and mixed with eggs, vinegar, mustard seeds, and molasses and is great for dipping or drizzling on any meal. Hot sauce and red peppers often replace the pickling liquid and jalapeños, respectively, and work for this, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup Colman's dry  mustard 
 ⅓ cup cider  vinegar 
 2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds 
 2 large  eggs 
 ½ cup  beer  or  water 
 2 tablespoons minced pickled  jalapeños   or  (4 minced red chilies) 
 2 tablespoons jalapeño pickling liquid  or  (4 tablespoons hot sauce) 
 1 ½ tablespoon  molasses 
 1 tablespoon minced  onion , red, white, or yellow only 
 ½ teaspoon salt 
 Directions : 
 In a small bowl, mix the dry mustard and vinegar until a smooth paste forms. Stir with mustard seeds; cover, then let the mixture sit at room temperature for several hours. 
 Transfer the mustard mixture to a small, heavy saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and warm over moderate-low heat. 
 Cook the mixture slowly, stirring frequently, until thick, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Transfer mustard to a small jar and refrigerate for later use. 
 The mustard keeps for up to 2 weeks. Just use it as you would with any other mustard.
