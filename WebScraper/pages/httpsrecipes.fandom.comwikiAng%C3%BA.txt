      Angú     
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups fine  cornmeal  (stone ground) 
 5 cups  water 
 1 cube  beef bouillon 
 2 tbsp  oil 
 Directions : 
 Whisk together  cornmeal  and 1 cup cool tap  water . 
 Set aside. 
 Bring 4 cups of  water  to full boil in a  saucepan , add  oil  and  beef bouillon . 
 Pour the  cornmeal  batter into boiling  water  and stir until thickened, about 50 minutes. 
 Stir with a wood spoon. 
 If you stop stirring the angú create hot bubble splashes that can burn you. 
 Cook less time if you’d like a past consistency angú and serve hot. 
 If you’d like a shaped angú, cook the whole 50 minutes and pour in a bundt or fluted tube pan. 
 Wait angú to cool before releasing in a serving plate.
