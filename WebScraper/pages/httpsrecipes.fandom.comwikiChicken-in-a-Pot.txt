 6 large  carrots , peeled and cut into 11⁄2-inch chunks 
 2 large  onions , halved and thinly sliced 
 4 long strips  lemon zest 
 4 sprigs fresh  dill  + 2 tablespoons chopped

 Directions : 
 Put the carrots, onions, lemon zest, dill sprigs, and olive oil in a 7-liter pressure cooker. 
 Season the vegetables with the ½ teaspoon salt and the chicken with salt, to taste. 
 Pour the broth in the pot, then nestle the chicken meat side down on top of the vegetables. 
 Close the pressure cooker lid, bring the pressure up to high (this can take up to 10 minutes). 
 Adjust the heat, if necessary, to maintain an even high pressure for 10 minutes.
