      Cabinet pudding     This classic dessert is made with layers of  bread , cake or  ladyfingers  (which may be soaked with  liqueur ),  dried fruit  and  custard . The pudding is baked, unmolded and usually served with cr√®me anglaise. Another version of cabinet pudding uses gelatin and whipped cream; rather than being baked, it's simply chilled until set.
