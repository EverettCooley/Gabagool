 Ingredients : 
 Berry Bundt Cake : 
 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup unsalted butter* softened to room temperature 
 1 3/4 cup white sugar 
 1 tablespoon lemon zest 
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 4 large eggs* 
 3/4 cup sour cream* or full-fat Greek yogurt 
 2 3/4 cups berries* fresh or frozen 
 1 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 Lemon Glaze : 
 1 cup powdered sugar 
 1-2 tablespoon lemon juice freshly squeezed 
 Instructions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. 
 In a large bowl whisk together the 2 1/2 cups flour, baking powder and salt. 
 In a very large bowl beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest until very fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). 
 Add in the vanilla extract and beat in the eggs 1 at a time.  
 Beat in about 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by about 1/2 of the sour cream. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Repeat the rest of the process until all the flour and sour cream have been incorporated. Be careful not to over mix the batter. 
 Toss the berries in the 1 tablespoon flour. 
 Gently fold in the berries using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.  
 Brush a bundt pan with pan release*, ensuring to get into every cranny/edge.  
 Spoon the batter into the bundt pan and spread the top smooth. 
 Bake in the preheated oven for 55-65 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
