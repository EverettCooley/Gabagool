 General Tips : 
 Actually thinking of snacks as hors d'oeuvres - rather than desserts ~ will open up a whole new way of looking at this category. 
 Hint : use  cucumber  "coins" instead of crackers. 
 When cutting up with kids, have your children help you cut up  green onions ,  parsley ,  lettuce ,  cheese  slices, fruit, etc., using a scissors instead of a knife. Using a scissors helps coordination (yes!) and keeps them busy for a  long  time!
