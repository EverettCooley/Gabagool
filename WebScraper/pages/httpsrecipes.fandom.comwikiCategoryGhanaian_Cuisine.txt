All the local plants and fruit are highly used as bases for the main foods. The fruits, such as: bananas, avocados, grapefruits, mangos, papayas, coconut and plantains are not only used for sweet meals, but also as the main course, besides the traditional stew. Bananas used both for the leaves and for the inner fruit in most of the Ghanaian desserts. The stew is, together with the soup, the most common dish.
