Description : 
 4 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 300 g (10 oz)  lentils 
 4  sausages 
 1 cup  tomato purée 
 2 tbsp  olive oil 
 2 cloves  garlic 
 1 stick  celery 
 1 small piece  chilli pepper 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  lentils  in  water  for 12 hours. 
 Drain and cook in salted  water  for about 30 minutes — bear in mind that this type cooks pretty quickly. 
 When the cooking time is nearly through, add 1 clove  garlic  and a piece of  celery  to be removed when you strain the  lentils  — remove from the heat when still slightly al dente. 
 Mince the other  garlic  clove and the rest of the  celery  and fry gently with the  oil  in a saucepan over a moderate to low heat for 3–4 minutes. 
 Turn the heat up slightly, add the  sausage  and brown for 3 minutes; pour in the  tomato  purée along with the  chilli pepper . 
 Simmer for 20 minutes or until the sausages are nearly done, pour in the  lentils , a cup of  water , and season with  salt . 
 Cover the pot and leave to gain flavour over a low heat for about 20 minutes, moistening if necessary, with boiling  water : the dish should be somewhat rich and dense.
