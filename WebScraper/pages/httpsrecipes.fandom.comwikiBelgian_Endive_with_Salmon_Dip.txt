Looking for a simple dip that would complement the slight bitterness in Belgian endive, we added yogurt-salmon mixture. Great taste and makes a fine appetizerÂ !
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 x Heads  Belgian endive 
 1/2 cup  yogurt 
 1/4 cup Minced  celery 
 2 tbl Minced  Shallots 
 2 tbl Minced  pimento 
 2 tbl Minced fresh  dill 
 1 tsp Grated  lemon peel 
 1/2 lb Cooked salmon chilled and Flaked 
 Few drops hot pepper sauce 
 Directions :

 Combine the  yogurt ,  celery ,  Shallots ,  pimento ,  dill , and  lemon peel .

 Season to taste with hot pepper sauce . 
 Mound mixture in a shallow bowl and tuck the  Endive  leaves around the edges.
