Description : 
 Château d'Barre is a more expensive, homemade version of "Syrup" (the drink, also known as "purple drank"). There is also a variation called "Huile de Beaujolais", in which Chateau d’Yquem  Sauternes  is replaced by  Beaujolais nouveau , a  red wine . This is the real:" purple drank " of the two.

 1 kilogram  refined sugar 
 0.5 litres  tonic water 
 1 cup Chateau d’Yquem ®   Sauternes

 Add wine and stir once more. 
 Chill mixture in refrigerator for 3 hours. 
 Serve cold, on  ice  if desired.
