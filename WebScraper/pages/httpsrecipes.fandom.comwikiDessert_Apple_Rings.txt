 Description : 
 Onions rings are an All-American classic, but did you know that apples make delicious “rings,” too?! This Apple Dessert Rings recipe uses my Cinnamon Cream Syrup recipe just like onion rings use ketchup for dipping. This is “Not-Your-Mama’s” apple dessert!
 
 Makes 16 apple rings – serves 4 to 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  egg white 
 1 cup  water 
 1 tablespoon  vanilla 
 1 cup  all purpose flour 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 6 large  Granny Smith apples , peeled 
 canola oil  for frying 
 cinnamon sugar  for garnishing 
 Cinnamon Cream Syrup : 
 1 cup  honey 
 ½ cup  corn  syrup 
 ½ teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ½ cup evaporated milk 
 
 Directions : 
 Whisk egg until frothy and the whisk in water and vanilla. 
 Whisk in flour and salt and let sit while slicing apples. 
 Slice peeled apples into ½ inch thick slices (you will get about 4 slices per apple). Using varying sized biscuit cutters, cut “rings” out of apple slices, discarding smallest circle containing core. 
 Heat oil to 375°F. (Caution: Don’t let oil get too hot – your rings will burn quickly. If rings are cooking too quickly, lower the heat of the oil a bit.) 
 Dip apple rings into batter, letting excess drip off. Cook in oil in small batches, turning frequently to monitor browning. 
 When the rings turn golden brown, remove to a plate and while still hot sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar. 
 Serve immediately with warm drizzled cinnamon cream syrup. 
 Cinnamon Cream Syrup : 
 In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, ½ cup corn syrup and ½ teaspoon cinnamon. 
 Bring to a boil, stirring for 3 minutes. 
 Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. 
 Stir in ½ cup evaporated milk. 
 Serve warm.
