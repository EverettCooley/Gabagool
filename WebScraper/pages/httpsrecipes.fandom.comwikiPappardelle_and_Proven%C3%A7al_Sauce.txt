 Description : 
 This is a simple pasta dinner that's easy to prepare and is loaded full of flavor. If you can't find pappardelle noodles in your grocery store, you can use any other type of ribbon pasta available.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 small  red onions 
 â…” cup  vegetable stock 
 1 - 2  garlic  cloves, crushed 
 4 tbsp  red wine  (something you would drink - doesn't have to be fancy wine) 
 2  zucchini , cut into "fingers" 
 1  yellow bell pepper , seeded and sliced 
 14 oz can  tomatoes 
 2 tsp fresh  thyme 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 12 oz  pappardelle  or other  ribbon pasta 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 fresh thyme and 6  black olives , pitted and coarsely chopped, to garnish 
 Directions : 
 Cut each onion into eight wedges through the root end, to hold them together during cooking. Put into a saucepan with the stock and garlic. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 5 minutes until tender. 
 Add the red wine, zucchini, yellow pepper, tomatoes, thyme, sugar and seasoning. Bring to a boil and cook gently for 5 - 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to coat the vegetables with the sauce. Do NOT overcook the vegetables; they are much nicer if they remain slightly crunchy. 
 Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water according to the package instructions, until al dente. Drain thoroughly. 
 Transfer the pasta to warmed serving plates and top with the vegetables. Garnish with fresh thyme and chopped black olives.
