 Description : 
 This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands. Flavor it with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such as  strawberry  and  lemon . If you want, you can instead divide it into three portions and add a few drops of  food coloring  to tint it yellow, red, and green. The knead a small amount of flavoring into each one. 
 
 This recipe makes about 1 ½ lbs of candy. 
 Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup soft  butter 
 ⅓ cup  light corn syrup 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tsp flavoring 
 3½ cup (1 lb) sifted  confectioner's sugar 
 Things You'll Need : 
 large bowl 
 wooden spoon 
 paper plates 
 pencils 
 Directions : 
 Help the children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl. They can take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it becomes too stiff. 
 Then they can knead it with their hands. They should continue kneading until the dough is smooth. 
 Give each child a paper plate and a pencil. 
 Tell them to turn their plates over and write their names on the bottom to prevent pencil lead from getting on their  mints . Help them hold their pencils correctly. Make sure they use upper and lower case letters. 
 Give each child a portion of dough on his or her plate. The children can pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and press them lightly with a fork to make a fancy  butter   mint . Children who cannot roll the candy into balls can make snakes, cut the snakes into pieces, and press the pieces with a fork. They might eat the pieces with the fork, but that's okay too. 
 Leave the  mints  on the plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes, until they become firm. 
 Cover with plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator. 
 Notes : 
 Easter  mints  taste even better the second day, if you can keep everyone from eating them all on the first day.
