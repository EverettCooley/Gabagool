Very small green pears
1/8 tsp. salt
Water
Vinegar
Sugar
Stick cinnamon
 Use small green pears for this recipe. Peel pears leaving stems on
them. Use as many pears as you can cook in a 6 quart pressure cooker
at one time (about 2/3 full). Cook in pressure cooker not over 8
minutes in 1/8 teaspoon salt and about 2 inches of water. Drain in
colander.
 Mix vinegar, sugar and stick cinnamon. Use 1 cup vinegar to 2 cups
sugar to 4 sticks cinnamon. Using these proportions, mix enough liquid
to cover the pears. Cook liquid about 5 minutes after the sugar
dissolves. Add pears and cook 10 to 15 minutes longer. Be sure pears
are covered in the liquid. Put in hot jars and seal.
