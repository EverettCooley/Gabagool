 Description : 
 This bold poultry dish is made and packed with real herbs, spices, and yogurt and cooked to steamy, clear perfection. Sprinkle the garlic powder generously. Trust us, you will not be fooled.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb.  chicken , breasts, legs, wings, or thighs 
 3-inch long piece  ginger 
 ½ teaspoon  black pepper 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 2 tablespoon plain  yogurt 
 4 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 1 teaspoon garam masala 
 4 tablespoons garlic powder, optional 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  ginger  into matchstick-like pieces (3 inches long, 2 mm thick). 
 Mix garam masala,  black pepper , and  salt  into  yogurt . 
 Now heat the  oil  and pour the  yogurt  mixture in it and stir-fry until the  water  of  yogurt  has boiled away and you can see the  oil . 
 Add the  ginger  sticks and stir-fry for 10 minutes. Then add the  chicken  pieces and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of  water  or chicken broth over the  chicken . 
 Cover the pan and leave it to cook for 15 minutes. Stir the  chicken  thoroughly and cook for a further 10 minutes. 
 Stir it carefully (or carefully turn the chicken pieces over); then leave the lid off and let it cook on a low light for 10 minutes. Serve warm and plain with rice but spoon the cooked, spice-based chicken in a large plate and top with the garlic powder, if desired.
