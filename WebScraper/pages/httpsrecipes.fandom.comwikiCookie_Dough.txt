Ingredients : 
 1 cup White Wave  soy yogurt 
 1 cup  applesauce  (unsweetened) 
 2 to 3 cups  turbinado sugar 
 2 tbsp  vanilla 
 1 cup  rolled oats  (whole) 
 2 cup  rolled oats  (process in food processor to coarse  flour 
 1 cup  unbleached flour 
 1½ tbsp  baking powder 
 1½ tbsp  baking soda 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 2 tbsp Ener-G  egg replacement 
 Directions : 
 Mix well the soy yogurt, applesauce, sugar, vanilla and rolled oats. 
 In a separate bowl, sift together the unbleached flour, baking powder and soda, salt and egg replacement. 
 Combine mixtures. 
 The  baking soda  should react somewhat, making the mass fluffy and easy to stir. 
 Add more  flour  until a cookie dough texture is reached (i had to use ~ 2.75 cups total). 
 Add chips or fruit or whatever. 
 Shape into balls and bake at 375°F until browned. 
 They do brown, they don't melt around the edges in that weird way that bad cookies do, and were considered entirely successful.
