Description : 
 Puso ng Saging (Tagalog) literally means heart of  banana , because it is red and it sort of heart-shaped. It's actually the  banana  infloresence from where (probably) the  banana  fruit comes from. The bloom "puso" itself when sliced thinly crosswise is the main ingredient of "ginataang puso ng saging" (Tagalog) or "linabog" or "labog" (Aklanon). It is nothing but the puso cooked in  coconut milk .
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  banana blossoms  (i just used the ones in the can, 10 oz drained) 
 1 cup pure  coconut milk 
 2 tbsp  vinegar  (if using 5% acidity  vinegar , try 1:1  vinegar / water ) 
 ¼ cup sliced  tomatoes 
 ¼ cup sliced  onion 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1 tbsp vegetable  oil 
 2  dried red chillies  (optional if you want this slightly spicy) 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 If using fresh puso ng saging ( banana blossoms ): remove the tough covering of the blossoms. 
 Slice thin crosswise. 
 Add 2 tbsp  salt  and squeeze off  bitter  juice. 
 Rinse in  water  and squeeze dry. 
 Set aside. 
 If using canned puso ng saging: drain, rinse then drain again. 
 Slice thin crosswise. 
 Set aside. 
 Heat  oil  in skillet, if using dried red chillies, add them when the  oil  is hot but not smoking and let the skins darken somewhat before you add the  garlic . 
 Saute  garlic  until light brown. 
 Add  onion , fry till translucent, then add  tomatoes . 
 Cook for around 3 minutes. 
 Add  banana blossoms  and  vinegar / water  mixture and then bring to boil without stirring.

 Continue to cook until  banana blossom  is tender.

 Let stand for a few minutes to help develop the flavours.
