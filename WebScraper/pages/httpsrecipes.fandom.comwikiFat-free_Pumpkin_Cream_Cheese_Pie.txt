Ingredients : 
 Crust : 
 1 pack  phyllo dough 
 Filling : 
 8 oz fat-free  cream cheese 
 1 can  pumpkin 
 3 tbsp  skim milk 
 4  egg whites 
 2 tbsp  pumpkin pie spice 
 ¼ cup  maple syrup  or  honey 
 1 tbsp  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 Crust : 
 I just unrolled it out of the package, laid it on top of the pie dish that I'd sprayed with PAM and pressed it in. 
 I used kitchen scissors and cut off the excess. 
 Filling : 
 Mix everything in a blender and pour into crust. 
 I only have a deep dish pie plate, so I doubled this recipe (I actually made 2 separate batches). 
 I brushed the crust with  skim milk , wrapped aluminum foil around the edges and baked it at 350°F for 30 minutes. 
 When I take it to my mother's house tomorrow, I will brush the edges again, and probably bake it for 15 minutes, just to brown the crust.
