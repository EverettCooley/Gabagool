      Cranberry Casserole     
 Description : 
 This fresh, colorful casserole balances the tartness of cranberries with the sweetness of apples.  It is great for dessert, and also works well as an alternative for breakfast and brunch.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For the fruit base : 
 3 cups  Granny Smith  or  Honeycrisp apples , peeled and chopped 
 2 cup raw  cranberries 
 1 ½ tsp.  lemon juice 
 1 ½ cup  white sugar 
 Topping : 
 1 ⅓ cup  quick oats 
 1 cup chopped  walnuts  or  pecans 
 1 ⅓ cup  brown sugar 
 1 stick  butter , melted 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 325°F. 
 In a shallow 2 qt. casserole, mix cranberries and chopped apples 
 In a small bowl, mix lemon juice and white sugar. 
 Sprinkle this mixture over the fruit until just moistened. 
 In another bowl, mix together all ingredients for topping and sprinkle over the top of the fruit. 
 Bake at 325°F for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve hot or cold.  May be topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. 
 Notes : 
 When using honeycrisp apples, which are much sweeter than granny smith, reduce granulated sugar to taste. 
 Any tart baking apple may be used 
 Topping may be made by cutting softened butter into oats instead of melting it. 
 For a slightly thicker consistency, more like pie-filling, add a tablespoon of cornstarch or flour with the lemon juice and sugar.
