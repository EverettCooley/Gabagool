 Description : 
 My family will only eat unsweetened cornbread.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1/4 cups corn meal 
 3/4 cup flour 
 1 T baking powder 
 1 t salt 
 1 egg 
 1 1/4 cups milk 
 1 T melted butter 
 Directions : 
 Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, 
 add milk to desired consistency (I like a thinner batter), then add the egg and mix well. 
 Spray pan well with vegetable oil or butter the pan. No oil in the batter. 
 Bake @ 380 degrees until nicely browned. 
 For cholesterol free just add the egg white.
