Cajun Black Iron Pot Roast 
 Serves: 8 
 
   5      pounds        boneless beef rump -- whole piece
  4                    garlic cloves -- slivered
                       salt and pepper
  1      cup           cider vinegar
  2      tablespoons   peanut oil
  2      cups          black coffee
  2      cups          hot water
    1/4  cup           flour -- blended with 4 tbsp
                       -- butter

 
 Pierce gashes into the meat on all sides and insert slivers of 
garlic. Tie meat, if necessary, into a firm round shape. Rub meat 
with salt and pepper. Place the roast into a deep bowl just large 
enough to hold it. Pour over the vinegar and allow to stand 24 hours, 
turning several times. Remove meat and pat dry before cooking. Heat 
oil in an iron pot. Brown the meat well on all sides over high heat. 
Add the hot water and coffee. Cover the pot and cook, barely 
simmering for 4 to 6 hours, or until the meat is very tender. When 
done, remove the meat to a heated platter. Skim oil from remaining 
juices and thicken them with flour-and-butter mixture. Cook, stirring 
until gravy is smooth and the desired consistency. This makes a 
substantial meal, and works very well with venison substituting for 
beef. From the January/February/92 edition of the Louisiana 
Conservationist.
