Description : 
 The ideal consistency should be similar to french crÃªpes batter. If you could find a Japanese potato called " nagaimo " (long and hairy) use about 4 inch long. This is the most preferred  potato . The batter is better with  potato  but this can be also omitted, just adjust  water .
 Always check the ingredients to make sure the product is vegan.
