 Description : 
 This recipe is from Yotam Ottolenghi's vegetarian cookbook "Plenty". It was published in  guardian.co.uk 
 
 Serves four to six. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large  onion , sliced 
 1 medium  fennel  bulb, sliced 
 about 120 ml  olive oil 
 1 large  carrot , peeled, cut in half lengthways and sliced 
 3  celery  sticks, sliced 
 1 tbsp  tomato purée 
 250 ml  white wine 
 400g tinned Italian  plum tomatoes 
 1 tbsp chopped  oregano 
 2 tbsp chopped  parsley 
 1 tbsp  thyme  leaves 
 2  bay leaves 
 2 tsp  caster sugar 
 1 litre  vegetable stock 
 salt  and  black pepper 
 160 g stale sourdough bread (crust removed) 
 400 g cooked  chickpeas 
 4 tbsp basil  pesto  (ideally homemade) 
 1 handful shredded  basil  leaves 
 Directions : 
 Heat the oven to 180 °C / gas mark 4. 
 Put the onion and fennel in a large pan, add three tablespoons of oil and sauté over medium heat for four minutes. 
 Add the carrot and celery, and soften, stirring occasionally, for four minutes. 
 Add the tomato purée, stir for a minute, then add the wine and let it bubble for a minute or two. 
 Add the tomatoes, herbs, sugar and stock, and season. 
 Bring to a boil, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, break the bread into chunks, toss with two tablespoons of oil and some salt, and scatter in a roasting tin. 
 Bake for 10 minutes, until thoroughly dry, then set aside. 
 About 10 minutes before you want to serve, put the chickpeas in a bowl and crush them a little with a potato masher or the end of a rolling pin; you want some to be left whole. 
 Add the chickpeas to the soup and simmer for five minutes. 
 Next add the toasted bread, stir and cook for another five minutes. 
 Taste the soup and add salt and pepper liberally. 
 Ladle the hot soup into bowls. 
 Spoon some pesto in the centre, drizzle with plenty of olive oil and finish with shredded basil, if you like.
