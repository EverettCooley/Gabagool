 About Neapolitan ice cream : 
 Brick-shaped ice cream made up of three differently flavored  ice creams  (usually vanilla, chocolate and strawberry). It is normally served in slices, each of which displays the tri-colored ice cream. Other desserts (or gelatin salads) made in three distinct layers are also labeled Neapolitan.
