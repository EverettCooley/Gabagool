Hot Red Bean Paste is a Korean product made with fermented soybeans and powdered chilies. It is extremely hot for many people. Adding a little to your dish and then checking for seasoning is a must. This recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon per serving and is a mild heat. Adding more paste 1/4 teaspoon at a time will certainly increase the heat.
