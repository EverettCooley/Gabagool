Description : 
 Algerian Eggplant
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 medium  eggplant  sliced into ½" rounds 
 salt 
 olive oil 
 Garlic confit : 
 24 (approximately) cloves of  garlic 
 Directions : 
 If your  eggplant  is not so good you might have to  salt  it for 30 minutes or so to release the bitter juices. 
 Rinse, drain and pat dry. 
 When choosing  eggplants  look for smooth skin and firmness. The one's that sound a bit hollow are not so good to use. 
 Cook the  eggplant  in a pan with about ½" of  olive oil , over medium/low heat, add more  olive oil  as the  eggplant  slices absorb the  oil  for about 15–20 minutes total, turn midway through cooking. Do not crowd the pan. You will have to do this in batches. The  eggplant  should have a golden color and be very tender. 
 Mash with a fork, taste for  salt , adjust. 
 Plate the  eggplant  and stud with the  garlic  confit. You can use the  oil  for vinaigrettes or to dip  bread  into or pour it over the  eggplant . 
 Garlic confit : 
 Put the  garlic  in a small pot, cover with  olive oil  and cook on very low heat until it develops the color shown. 
 You may have to turn off the heat occasionally if the  oil  gets too hot. 
 Another option is to roast in an oven with something else. 
 I think it's nonsense to turn on an oven just for 24 cloves of  garlic .
