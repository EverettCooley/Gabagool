 2 Quarts  orange juice 
 2 T.  lemon juice 
 1/4 Cup  sugar 
 orange  Slices And  lemon  Slices
 
 2 Bottles (25 Oz. Each) Champagne, Chilled 
 strawberries 
 Decorative  ice  Ring And  orange juice  Cubes
 
Combine  orange juice ,  lemon juice ,  sugar  And Fruit in a Large Bowl And Refrigerate. if You Punch Bowl Fits in Your Refrigerator, it Can be Used. Just Before Serving, Add The Chilled Champagne And Stir. Float in The  strawberries  And Some Decorative  ice . Serve in a Lovely Stemmed Glass With a  strawberry  Floating on Top. Makes 1 Gallon Punch And Will Serve 12 Generously.
 To Make Decorative  ice :
 Freeze 1 Quart  orange juice  in an  ice  Cube Tray. These  ice  Cubes Will Not Dilute The Punch. Place 1  maraschino cherry  in Each Compartment of an  ice  Tray, Fill With  orange juice  or Other Juice And Freeze.Fill a Ring Mold With  strawberries ,  lemon  Slices,  orange  Slices or Other Fruit. Half Fill it With  water , Cover With Foil And Freeze. When Frozen, Fill The Mold With Additional Cold  water  And Freeze Again. This Will Keep The Fruit From Floating to The Top And Melting Into The Punch Too Soon. if Fruit Pops Up, Press it Back Into The Mold When it is Partially Frozen. to Unmold, Dip Mold Into Warm  water  For a Few Seconds And it Will Easily Slip Out.
