 Description : 
 Pinolillo (pee-noh-LEE-yoh)  grain  beverages such as this one are common throughout Central and South America and parts of Africa. Because it will be quite different to many people in the U.S., especially children, you might want to serve a small portion so that it is not wasted. One reason such drinks may be popular is that they provide extra nutrition in a diet that is not substantial. Remember when you drink this to regularly twirl your glass to keep the  cornmeal  suspended.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup white  cornmeal  or  masa harina  ( cornmeal  prepared with  lime ) 
 2 tablespoons  cocoa 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 Â¼ teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 dash of ground cloves 
 5 cups  water 
 Directions : 
 Put all ingredients in a pitcher. 
 Beat hard until the  cornmeal  and  cocoa  are well mixed. Chill. Stir well before serving.
