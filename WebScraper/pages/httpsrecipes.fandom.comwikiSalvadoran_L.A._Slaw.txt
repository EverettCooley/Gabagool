 4 cloves  garlic , finely-chopped and mixed with ⅓ cup ice water 
 ½ tsp  tabasco sauce , or to taste 
 1½ tbsp  chili powder 
 1½ tsp  salt , or to taste 
 1 head green  savoy cabbage , chopped into small pieces

 Put the  vinegar ,  oil , and  garlic  in  ice   water , tabasco,  chili powder , and  salt  in a large mixing bowl. 
 Mix very well. 
 Add the  cabbage  and toss and stir until it is well coated with the dressing. 
 Cover and chill and use as needed.

 Note: there are lots of Salvadoran restaurants in Los Angeles that serve papusas, slightly plump little tortillas filled with spicy meat or  cheese . 
 This is the peppy slaw that goes along with them.
