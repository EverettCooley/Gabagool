This freezes well. I generally make this the night before and refrigerate it for the next day. Yum!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pack  manicotti   pasta  (jumbo shells will also do) 
 1 jar of your favorite  pasta  sauce 
 1 container of fat free  ricotta  cheese 
 1  egg  white (or fave  egg  replacement) 
 1 can  spinach  (or use frozen if you can't find it canned) 
 1 pack shredded fat free  mozzarella  cheese 
 Directions : 
 Cook  manicotti  or shells until almost done. Meaning the  pasta  should still be a little hard. Drain and cool. 
 In a bowl, mix  ricotta  cheese,  spinach ,  egg  white with half of the package  mozzarella  cheese. Mixture should be a little thick—not runny. If runny, add more  mozzarella  cheese. 
 Add about 3 tablespoons of  pasta  sauce to mixture and whatever herbs you prefer...  basil ,  oregano ,  parsley , etc. 
 When  manicotti  is cool, stuff with mixture and place in a baking pan. 
 Top with remaining  pasta  sauce and sprinkle remaining  mozzarella  cheese. 
 Bake for about 30 minutes at 350 °F or until cheese is fully melted on top.
