 About Grappa : 
 Grappa, also known as Grappa Wine, is an Italian grape-based spirit of between 40% and 60% alcohol by volume (80 to 120 proof). It is made from the distillation of pomace, i.e., the residue of grapes (including the stems and seeds) that were pressed for the winemaking process. It was originally made to prevent wastage by using the leftovers at the end of the wine season. It quickly became commercialised, mass-produced, and sold to the world.
 The flavour of grappa, like wine, depends on the type and quality of the grape used. However, many producers have added fruit syrup to sweeten and soften the mix so that it appeals more to the American market.
 Sometimes, usually in Italy, grappa is added to espresso and known as a "Caffè Corretto", which can also be made with other alcohols, such as sambuca. The other variation of this is the "Amazza Caffè"; literally, "to kill the coffee". The espresso is drunk first, followed by a few, downed ounces of grappa served in proper glass.
