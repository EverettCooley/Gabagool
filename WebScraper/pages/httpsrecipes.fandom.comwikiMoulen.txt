 Mussels Luxembourg-style
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 – 4 kg cleaned  mussels 
 2  leeks 
 1  carrot 
 1  onion 
 1 – 2  shallots 
 1 large stick of  celery  and some  celery leaf 
 a bunch of  parsley 
 5 bulbs of  garlic 
 ½ bottle of  riesling 
 150 g  butter 
 pepper  and  salt 
 a sprig of  thyme 
 2  tarragon  leaves 
 Directions : 
 Clean all the vegetables, except the  garlic , and chop them very finely. 
 Allow the  butter  to reach room temperature so that it is soft. 
 Lightly fry the  onion  and shallots in 50 grammes of  butter  in a large pot, and add all the chopped vegetables and the  thyme  and  tarragon , also finely chopped. 
 Pour ½ of  riesling , and allow to simmer for a quarter of an hour. 
 During this time, crush the  garlic , and mix with the remaining 100 grammes of  butter . 
 To this add a little freshly milled  pepper . 
 Put the pot on a very high heat, and drop the mussels into the boiling contents, pouring in the rest of the wine. 
 Cover firmly. 
 Every two minutes stir with a circular movement to make sure the mussels do not remain at the bottom of the pot. 
 After ten minutes almost all the mussels should have opened. 
 Now put the  garlic   butter  in the pot. 
 In two or three minutes, with regular stirring, the sauce should have mixed thoroughly. 
 Sprinkle with freshly chopped  parsley , and serve immediately. 
 Crisp  pommes frites  should be served with mussels, and an outstanding  riesling .
