 3/4 cup hot  water ,  beef broth  or  chicken broth 
 1/3 cup  margarine 
 1/2 cup  powdered milk 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt  (optional) 
 1 tbsp minced  garlic

 Knead the dough for 3–4 minutes and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes, place on greased cookie sheet and bake for 50 minutes. 
 Remove from oven and let dog biscuits cool until dry and hard. (I often leave them in the oven after turning it off.) Makes approx. 1-1/4 pound dry dog biscuits.
