 Description : 
 Make sure the pastry ingredients are well chilled and the custard ingredients are at room temperature. The pastry is partially baked before filling to eliminate an uncooked pastry layer that sometimes can result.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups all purpose  flour , plus more for rolling (or tart shells) 
 1 TSP  salt 
 2 tablespoons  granulated sugar 
 10 tablespoons chilled unsalted  butter , cut into Â¼ inch cubes 
 5 to 7 tablespoons  ice   water 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the  flour ,  salt  and  Sugar  to combine. 
 Add the  butter  and pulse until the  flour  resembles coarse, uneven  cornmeal , about 10 1-second pulses. 
 Drizzle 5 tablespoons of the  ice   water  over the mixture. 
 Pulse several times to work the  water  into the  flour . 
 Add the remaining  water , 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue pulsing until the mixture develops small curds. 
 Turn the dough out onto a work surface, shape it into a disc and cover with plastic wrap. 
 Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
