Description : 
 I have modified the recipe as best I could it was originally for a saute pan and had an alternative method of cooking that said only cook on high for 60 minutes and reduce the liquids after cooking. Personally I think the liquids are high on this recipe and the cook time is also high. Adjust as needed in your pressure cooker
