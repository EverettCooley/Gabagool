      Agrumato     
 About agrumato : 
 In Abruzzo, on the Adriatic Sea, at the end of each harvest, farmers create a special oil for their family and friends. In their "frantoio" (olive mill) on the farm, the farmers crush and press the small amounts of hand-harvested olives with fresh citrus fruit to create oils such as agrumato itself. Agrume means "citrus". The crisp freshness of agrumato is achieved by the whole-fruit crushing process, which will never be duplicated by the more common infusion method of other citrus-flavored oils. By crushing the olives with the citrus, the purity of each fruit flavor is maintained. The resulting oil is an exquisitely versatile condiment.
