       CROATIAN BOW KNOTS     
 Ingredients : 
 2  eggs 
 2 tbsps  Sugar 
 1 tsp melted  butter 
 2 cups  flour 
 1/2 cup  milk 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Mix  eggs  and  Sugar  together and add melted  butter  and  salt . Add  flour  and  milk ; mix well. Roll out thin and cut into strips 1" by 4 1/2" then tie into knots. You may need to add extra flour while cutting and rolling as they can be difficult to form when sticky. Deep fry in hot  vegetable oil  until lightly brown turning occasionally as they will rise to the top. Remove them to a platter and sprinkle generously with  powdered sugar . Also try dipping in icing.
