Description : 
 I didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup, maybe as much as a cup, total, just enough to moisten everything. I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I don't know how many people it served — it filled a large bowl-- but there wasn't any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad that everyone liked it, I was sorry not to have some to take home). 
 
 Fatfree digest [volume 10 issue 49], Sept. 21994 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  wild rice 
 1 cup long-grain  brown rice 
 1 cup  green (French) lentils 
 1 each  red ],  yellow ,  green bell pepper , chopped 
 2 cups small  cherry tomatoes 
 1 or 2  carrots 
 ¼ cup chopped fresh  basil  (more or less) 
 1 to 2 tablespoon or chopped fresh  mint 
 non-fat tomato-herb dressing (Trader Joe's) 
 red wine vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Cook grains separately, in 2 cups  water , until done, 45 minutes or less. 
 Combine with bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, carrots, basil and mint. 
 For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing mixed about half and half with  red wine vinegar  because I generally find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too sweet for my taste.
