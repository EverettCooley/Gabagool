 1 dash  cinnamon

 Person 2 pours the  apple juice , then the  vodka  in the drinker's mouth (drinker must be VERY careful to keep his/her throat closed). 
 Then person 2 sprays some in  whipped cream  and tops with a SMALL amount of  cinnamon  (too much will make drinker sneeze and possible other not-so-fun things). 
 Drinker sits up, swishes all ingredients together and swallows.
