 Ingredients : 
 8 – 10 large  lettuce  leaves 
 2  broccoli  stalks or around 7 florets 
 2 medium  carrots 
 2  green onions  [Skip--I don't like these] 
 1 cup fresh  fennel  bulb or tops [Skip--I don't like fennel] 
 1 small handful fresh  parsley  [We have this in a plastic tube in the refrig door] 
 2  roma tomatoes  ( or 1 beefsteak) [We always like these] 
 2 tablespoons  capers  or chopped  green olives  [I need to buy another jar anyway] 
 2 cups crushed  pistachios 
 1 cup crushed  cashews  [skip 'em] 
 ⅓ fresh  red bell pepper 
 2 big stalks  celery 
 1 cup chopped fresh  mushroom  (if using canned, save the juice) [Skip--I don't remember any in there] 
 2 heads fresh  lettuce  cored, and washed. set aside...to use for wraps 
 Sauce : 
 1 tablespoon  lime juice  [I think we have this in a plastic lime] 
 1 tablespoon  cilantro 
 ½ cup  sesame oil 
 ¼ cup  rice wine vinegar 
 1¼ cup  raw (turbinado) sugar 
 2½ teaspoons  sea salt 
 2 tablespoons seaweed gomisio (or substitute  sesame seeds  and tiny shredded  nori ) 
 2½ tablespoons minced  garlic 
 2 teaspoons freshly cracked  pepper 
 2 teaspoons  onion powder 
 2 teaspoons  coriander 
 2 tablespoons  hot sauce , optional 
 2 tablespoons  wasabi  powder, optional 
 Directions : 
 Get a huge bowl. 
 Chop all of the fresh ingredients (except  lettuce ) into fine bits. 
 Add all of the sauce ingredients and toss together. 
 Use the fresh, washed  lettuce  leaves as you would a tortilla for wrapping the filling. 
 For added taste, add ⅓ cup juice from  mushroom  can, or even strain the juice from a can of  kidney beans  or black that you might be using for something else. 
 This is a great way to use up the leftover produce in your fridge! If you want, you can change the seasonings for a different taste. 
 Try  black olives  instead of green with  tofu  for a Greek wrap, etc.
