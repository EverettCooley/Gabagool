      Cinnamon-Apple Pancakes     
 Ingredients : 
 1 3/4 cups whole-wheat  pastry flour 
 1/4 cup  wheat germ  or yellow  cornmeal 
 1 1/2 tsp. ground  cinnamon , plus more for dusting 
 1 tsp.  baking powder 
 2 large  egg whites 
 3 Tbs.  light brown sugar 
 1 1/2 to 2 cups  soy milk  or  low-fat milk 
 1 cup (heaping) peeled, cored, finely diced  Apple  (any all-purpose variety) 
 applesauce  or pure  maple syrup  for serving 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 200 °F. 
 In large bowl, mix together flour, wheat germ, cinnamon and baking powder. Set aside. 
 In medium bowl, lightly beat egg whites with fork until foamy. With rubber spatula, stir in brown sugar until dissolved, then stir in 1 1/2 cups milk until well combined. 
 Make a well in center of flour mixture. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until thoroughly combined, but don’t overmix or pancakes will be rubbery. 
 Add remaining 1/2 cup of milk if batter seems too thick. 
 Stir in diced apple. 
 Lightly coat nonstick griddle or large nonstick skillet with cooking spray then heat over medium-low heat until hot. 
 Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons batter onto skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. (These pancakes need to brown a bit more slowly than most to be cooked all the way through.) 
 Transfer pancakes to ovenproof plate, cover loosely with foil and keep warm in oven. 
 Repeat with remaining batter, lowering heat if pancakes brown too fast. 
 Serve warm with applesauce, maple syrup, and a dusting of cinnamon.
