This is a fantastic recipe for bolognese, made extra nutritious by the inclusion of some chunky chunks of veg. The tinned anchovies may sound mildly mental, but they really bring out the taste of the beef and generally buff the flavour up. Feel free to change any of the quantities or ingredients based on taste (and, of course, your preferred meat-to-veg ratio) just make sure to use tones of tomato puree so it turns out good and thick.
 I tend to make this in industrial quantities as it freezes really well and can also go on to become a  lasagna  .
 
 Ingredients : 
 garlic , finely sliced 
 fresh red chillies , finely sliced 
 1 tbsp dried  oregano 
 onions , roughly chopped 
 carrots , roughly chopped 
 mushrooms , roughly chopped 
 celery , roughly chopped 
 courgettes , roughly chopped 
 peppers , roughly chopped 
 beef mince 
 tin of  anchovies 
 glass of  red wine 
 tins of  tomatoes  (plum and chopped) 
 tin of  cannellini beans 
 1 (whole!) tube of  tomato pur√©e 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Ingredients : 
 Heat a good splash of olive oil to a large pan. 
 Add the garlic, chili and oregano and fry gently for a few minutes. 
 Add the onions, celery and carrots and then the rest of the veg and fry for 10 minutes or so. 
 Meanwhile cook the beef off in a frying pan until brown all over, and then scoop it out with a well-holed spoon (so that the fat stays in the pan). 
 Add the beef and the wine to the big pan, and turn up the heat until the wine boils away. 
 Add everything else to the pan in order, bring it to the boil, season it, and leave it to simmer for an hour or so. 
 Serve with pasta, garlic bread and a pile of grated cheese (cheddar, Parmesan, whatever).
