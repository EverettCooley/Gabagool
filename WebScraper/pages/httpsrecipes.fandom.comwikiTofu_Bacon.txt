 Ingredients : 
 1 Pound(s)  tofu 
 2 Tablespoon(s)  liquid smoke 
 2 Tablespoon(s) tamari 
 1 Pinch(s)  cayenne pepper 
 Directions : 
 okay. this is fairly easy, just watch you don't burn the  tofu . the amounts i put aren't exact. soooo.. you slice the  tofu  in strips, like  Bacon , then you deep fry them in a wok with half and half tamari and  liquid smoke . you decide how much is best for you. i guess it depends on how much you make. i always put a bit of  Cayenne  for the punch.
