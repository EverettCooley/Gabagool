Description : 
 I served over  brown rice  and provided bowls of hot sauce, fat-free  sour cream , chopped jalapeno  peppers , and chopped  onions . I also had a loaf of wheat bread and several people ate their  chili  with that instead of the  rice . Yum yum. I would imagine it's good the next day, maybe next time I'll double the recipe so that there will be some left over

 Stop here and refrigerate up to two days if you are making this up ahead of time. 
 When ready to finish, bring to gentle simmer and continue.
