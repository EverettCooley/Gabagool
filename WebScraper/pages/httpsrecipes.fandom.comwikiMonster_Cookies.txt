 This makes about 12 dozen enormous cookies 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  butter 
 3 lbs  peanut butter 
 2 lbs  brown sugar 
 4 cups  white sugar 
 1 tbsp  vanilla 
 12  eggs 
 18 cups  oatmeal 
 1 cup  flour 
 3 tbsp  baking soda 
 2½ x 12 oz bags  chocolate chips 
 1 lb M&M candies 
 2½ x 12 oz bags  butterscotch chips 
 1 lbs  nuts 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Mix in very large bowl (sugars, butter, peanut butter first, then eggs and vanilla, then flour, oatmeal and baking soda and finally all the goodies) I always ended up mixing with my hands by the time i get to the end. 
 Drop by large ice cream scoop (3-tablespoon size) on cookie sheet. 
 Flatten slightly. 
 Bake for about 12 minutes. 
 Cookies and dough both freeze well.
