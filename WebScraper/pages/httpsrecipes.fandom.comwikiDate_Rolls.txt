Ingredients : 
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons  all-purpose flour 
 1 stick less 1 tablespoon  sweet butter , softened 
 1 tablespoon  powdered sugar 
 1 tablespoon  oil 
 2 tablespoons  milk 
 FILLING : 
 
 2 tablespoons  butter 
 2 tablespoons  water 
 1 1/2 cups  dates , pitted and chopped 
 Directions : 
 1) Make the filling first. Melt the  butter  together with the  water  in a saucepan, then add the chopped  dates . Cook on a low heat, stirring the  dates  and pressing down until they become a soft paste. Remove and cool.
 2) To make the dough, sift the  flour  into a mixing bowl. Cut the soft  butter  into small pieces and work it into the  flour  with your fingers. Add the  Sugar  and mix in thoroughly. Make a well in the center, pour in the  oil  and  milk , then continue to knead the dough until pieces flake off the sides of the bowl. Knead a further 10 minutes, then roll into a ball and chill.
 3) Now preheat the oven to 350 °F and grease a large baking tray. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into three portions. Knead each well.
 4) On a floured board roll out and flatten a ball of dough. Cut into a neat rectangle shape. Spread one-third of the date mixture thinly over the top. Roll the rectangle into a roll and continue to roll backwards and forwards until it grows longer and thinner. Slice this into flat, diagonal sections, about 1 1/2 inches thick. Repeat this process using the remaining balls of dough.
 5) Place all slices side by side on the greased baking sheet and prick the tops lightly with a fork. Bake for 25–30 minutes in the pre-heated oven until slightly colored (if you overcook them, become hard). Allow to cool, then dust with  powdered sugar .
 6) Makes about 24 rolls.
