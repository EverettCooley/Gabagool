 Ingredients : 
 2½ cups  all purpose flour 
 2 cups  whole wheat flour 
 1 cup  rolled oats 
 ½ cup  wheat germ  (I use honey nut  wheat germ ) 
 ½ cup  cornmeal 
 14½ oz can  beef  or  chicken broth  (or make your own) 
 ½ cup  non-fat dry milk 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 pkg  dry yeast 
 ¼ cup warm  water 
 1 tbsp  milk 
 1 beaten  egg 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve  yeast  in ¼ cup warm  water  and let proof. 
 Warm the broth to about 110°F. 
 In large bowl, mix 2 flours,  oats ,  wheat germ ,  corn  meal, dry  milk  and  salt . 
 Stir in broth and  yeast  mixture. 
 Knead by hand for at least 3 minutes. Don't skimp on the kneading time! 
 Roll into a ½" thick sheet and cut with cookie cutter, or roll into a log shape and slice to desired size. 
 Mix the  egg  and  milk  and brush on before baking. 
 Bake at 300°F for about 40 minutes ( a little longer if they're big). 
 Turn off oven and leave in overnight (the longer you leave them in the warm oven, the crunchier they get). 
 Haven't met a dog in the park yet who doesn't love these all natural healthy treats!.
