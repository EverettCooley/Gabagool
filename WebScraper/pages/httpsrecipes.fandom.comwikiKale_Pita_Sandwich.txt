 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 kale  (amount varies depending on number of servings) 
 bean sprouts 
 * low sodium  teriyaki sauce 
 whole wheat vegan  pita  bread 
 garlic 
 Directions : 
 Tear  kale  into bite sized leaves, put in frying pan. 
 Add  bean sprouts  and low-sodium teriyaki sauce. (If you prefer, you may use  olive oil  or your favorite sauce insteadâ€”anything works). Briefly stir-fry the  kale , sprouts, and sauce. 
 On a plate, cut whole-wheat pita in half to leave you with 2 sandwiches. 
 Slice in half. I prefer  green olives , but any will do. 
 Layer the mixture from the frying pan with the inside the pita until the vegan bread is filled.
