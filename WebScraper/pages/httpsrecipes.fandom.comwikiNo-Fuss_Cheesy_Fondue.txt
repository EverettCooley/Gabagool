Introduction : 
 This no-fuss fondue is based on store-bought Alfredo pasta sauce, which works as the thickener; just add shredded Swiss cheese and a little white wine. Because most Alfredo sauces contain nutmeg, the seasoning is already in place.
 The cheese needs just 5 minutes to melt, and then you'll be all set to dunk cubes of French bread, slices of pear or whatever you fancy. And the recipe doubles easily if you want to serve more than four. 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup refrigerated Alfredo-style pasta sauce 
 1 (8-ounce) package shredded  Swiss cheese  (2 cups) 
 1/4 cup dry  white wine 
 Cubes of French bread, for dunking 
 Crisp  pear  slices, for dunking 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Place Alfredo sauce in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. 
 Add cheese and wine; stir until cheese melts and bubbles, 4 to 5 minutes. 
 Pour fondue into a fondue pot or chafing dish; light the heat source underneath to keep the fondue warm. 
 Serve with bowls of bread cubes and pear slices, and provide long forks for dunking.
