 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 1" cubes  fresh ginger , peeled & coarsely chopped 
 4 tbl  water 
 6 tbl  vegetable oil , * 
 2 1/2 lb  Chicken  parts, skinned ** 
 5 cloves  garlic , peeled and finely chopped 
 3 cup Fresh coriander (w/o roots & lower stems), very finely chopped (about 200g) 
 1/2 Fresh, hot green  chilli , very finely chopped, up to 1 
 1/4 tsp  Cayenne 
 2 tsp Ground  cumin 
 1 tsp Ground coriander 
 1/2 tsp  ground turmeric 
 1 tsp  salt 
 2/3 cup  water 
 2 tbl  lemon juice 
 Directions : 
 Try 3T  oil .
 6 kip filets; pound thicker part slightly to flatten. 
 [Translation: A kip filet is a skinned, boned,  Chicken  breast half.] 
 Put the giner and 4 tablespoons of the  water  into the container of an electric blnder. 
 Blend until you have a paste. [Not very paste-like, but still worked.] 
 Heat the  oil  in a wide, heavy, preferably non-stick pot over a medium-high flame. 
 When hot, put in as many  Chicken  pieces as the pot will hold in a single layer and brown on both sides. Remove the  Chicken  pieces with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the  Chicken  pieces this way. 
 Put the  garlic  into the same hot  oil . As soon as the pieces turn a medium brown color, turn heat to medium and pour in the paste from the blender. 
 Stir and fry it for a minute. Now add the fresh coriander,  green chile ,  Cayenne , ground  cumin , ground coriander,  turmeric , and  salt . Stir and cook for a minute. Put in all the  Chicken  pieces as well as any liquid that might have accumulated in the  Chicken  bowl. Also add 2/3 cup  water  and the  lemon juice . [I added this first and stirred before putting in  Chicken .] Stir and bring to a boil. 
 Cover tightly, turn heat to low, and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the  Chicken  pieces over. Cover again and cook another 10–15 minutes or until  Chicken  is tender. If the sauce is too thin, uncover the pot and boil some of it away over a slightly 
 higher heat. 
 Serving Ideas : Serve with Spiced  basmati rice . 
 NOTES : Extremely yummy! This is a nice company dish; it's easy and it doesn't need much attention for the last half hour.
