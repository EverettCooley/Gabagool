Description : 
 This dish is similar to, if not the same as, the arrozcaldo in the Philippines.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼  chicken 
 1 cup of  rice 
 ½ cup of  peas 
 ½ cup of  carrots  cut in small dices 
 4 cups of  water 
 chopped  onions  and  peppers 
 oil 
 aliño  (paste made with  garlic ,  salt ,  cumin , and water) 
 cilantro 
 Method : 
 Chop onions and peppers, and fry them. 
 Marinate the chicken with the aliño. 
 Add the chicken to the onions and peppers. 
 Add the rice, the peas, the carrots, the water, the cilantro, and let it cook. 
 It will reduce, so check if you need to add more water. 
 The idea is that the soup is a bit sticky due to the cooked rice. 
 Do not leave it with too much water. 
 When the soup is even stickier, it is called "meloso". 
 You can also do it with duck, or beef.
