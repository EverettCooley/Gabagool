A cheese made from whole milk of cows that ranges in color from natural white to orange, depending on the addition of the natural additive known as annatto that is used to color the orange grades of cheese.  Cheddar  has a flavor that ranges from mild and sweet to sharp and tangy, which is a result of the age of the cheese. Mild cheddar is aged from 2 to 4 months. Medium cheddar is aged from 4 to 6 months. Sharp cheddar is aged from 6 months to a year and extra sharp cheddar for 1 year or longer. Cheddar cheese originated in the town of Cheddar, England and is one of the most popular and versatile varieties of cheese available. It is often used in sandwiches with luncheon meat or as grilled cheese, as an appetizer or snack, as a dessert cheese with pie, and as an ingredient in a variety of cooked dishes.
