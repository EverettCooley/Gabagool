 Appetizers can be both light or complex and sometimes combined with fish or minced or roasted meat. The most frequent appetizers and snacks consist of vegetable meals, such as the spinach plasas or the traditional binch akara. The spinach plasas is made of frozen chopped spinach, smoked fish, chopped onions, groundnut paste, palm oil, cayenne pepper and stewing or roast meat. The recipe is very much loved in the country and it served with plain rice. The binch akara is made with black-eyed beans, vegetable oil and finely chopped onion and the small balls of this food are served with toothpicks.
