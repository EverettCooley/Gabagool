      Thai Peanut Spinach Salad     
 Description : 
 It’s strange. I don’t like peanut butter, but a good spicy Thai peanut sauce is one of my favorite things. I love it drizzled on just about everything. I had trouble making good peanut sauce until it finally dawned on me: to have really good Thai peanut sauce, you must start with really good peanut butter. It was one of those “Duh” moments for me! So, forget the popular brands and go for the good stuff for this recipe. It is a little more expensive, but you only use a little and it is well worth it. I like the all-natural kind that says “dark roasted” on the label, and only has two ingredients: salt and peanuts. I made this recipe with the idea of serving it cold on salads, so it is more like a vinaigrette than a sauce you would serve warm with chicken.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Thai  spinach 
 Spicy Thai Peanut Dressing : 
 ⅓ cup all-natural  peanut butter 
 ¼ cup  rice vinegar 
 3 tablespoons  canola oil 
 1 teaspoon  sesame oil 
 3 tablespoons  soy sauce 
 3 tablespoons sweetener ( honey ,  agave nectar  or sugar substitute equivalant) 
 ½ teaspoon  cayenne pepper sauce 
 1 tablespoon grated  ginger 
 3 cloves  garlic 
 ½ teaspoon  kosher salt 
 Garnish : 
 diced roasted  peanuts 
 Directions : 
 Very lightly and briefly sauté some rough chopped spinach for less than a minute until it just barely starts to wilt. You could also blanch it  SUPER  quickly in boiling water. 
 Drained, and drizzle with the Thai peanut sauce recipe, and sprinkle with some diced roasted peanuts.
