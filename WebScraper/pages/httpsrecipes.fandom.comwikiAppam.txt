Description : 
 Ethnicity - South Indian 
 Type of meal - Party, Lunch, Dinner 
 Ingredients : 
 3 cup: Rice-soak in  water  with  daal 
 1 cup: Urad  daal  dhuli-soak for 4 hours 
 1 cup: Coconut-grated 
 1 tbsp:  methi  dana 
 1 tsp:  salt  or to taste 
 An appam maker or a small, shallow kadahi- 6”-8” diameter on top  oil  to cook 
 Directions : 
 Drain the  water  out of the  daal  mixture and grind together with the  coconut  and  salt . 
 Leave to ferment 6-7 hours, or overnight. 
 When fermented, add enough  water  to make it a pouring consistency. 
 Heat a tablespoon of  oil  in the kadahi/appam maker, swirl it around and pour off extra  oil . 
 When hot, pour about L cup batter in the kadahi. 
 Turn the kadahi around swiftly, to let a thin layer rise up to cover the sides of the kadahi also. The center is thicker. 
 Cover, lower the heat and cook, till the edges start lifting (about a minute). 
 Uncover, ease out the appam thus formed and transfer on to a serving plate. 
 Continue thus with the rest of the batter. 
 You might have to grease again only after 3-4 appams
