Ingredients : 
 3 – 4 cups  canola  or  peanut oil  for frying 
 2 green  plantains 
 salt  or  garlic salt 
 Directions : 
 Pour the  oil  to a depth of 2 or 3 inches in a deep-fat fryer, Dutch oven or heavy skillet and heat to 350°F. 
 Peel the  plantains . 
 Slice as thinly as possible (length-wise for "mariquitas" or in round chips for "chicharritas") using a mandolin if you have one, with the blade at its thinnest opening. 
 Slide them into the hot oil in small batches to prevent clumping. 
 Fry until golden brown and crispy (about 1 or 2 minutes), turning with a metal skimmer. 
 Drain on paper towels. 
 Sprinkle with  salt  and/or garlic salt. 
 Serve immediately.
