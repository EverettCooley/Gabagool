Description : 
 Stuffed Cabbage Head. Yet another I've pulled out of "The Czechoslovak Cookbook". Of course I had to add  garlic  to the recipe :) Also for a little extra kick you can use some spicy bloody Mary mix instead of the  cream of tomato  soup. I hope you enjoy this, we sure do. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 head  cabbage 
 1 medium  onion , chopped 
 ¼ cup  butter 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 lb ground meat (whatever your prefer) 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1 tablespoon minced  parsley 
 ⅔ cup  cream of tomato  soup 
 1  egg , beaten 
 1½ cups  chicken broth 
 Directions : 
 Remove the stump from the  cabbage  and discard. 
 Scoop out and save the inside of the  cabbage , leaving about a 1- 1½ inch shell. 
 Chop the  cabbage  you scraped out of the inside. 
 Cook  onion  and  garlic  in 2 tbsp  butter  over medium high heat until  onion  is wilted. 
 Add meat and brown. 
 Add chopped  cabbage ,  salt ,  pepper ,  parsley , and  tomato  soup. 
 Cook covered about 10 minutes. 
 Drain and allow to cool, then add  egg  and mix together well. 
 Fill  cabbage  with mixture (you will usually have some left over unless you pack very tight) and cover with a  cabbage  leaf securing with a toothpicks. 
 Put broth and remaining  butter  in a large casserole or large pot, place  cabbage  in pot (open side up obviously) and cover. 
 Cook in over at 375 °F for about an hour and 15 minutes. 
 Cut into wedges and serve.
