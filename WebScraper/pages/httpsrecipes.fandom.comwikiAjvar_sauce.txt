Ajvar and aijvar Macedonian Cyrillic: ajвар/aивар; pronounced [ˈajvar]) is relish, made principally from  red bell peppers , with  eggplant ,  garlic  and  chili pepper . Ajvar originated in  Macedonian Cuisine , and was therefore long known as "Macedonian salad" or "Macedonian vegetable caviar". It becаme a popular salad (side dish) throughout Yugoslavia after World War II and is nowadays popular in the Balkans. Original homemade ajvar is made of roasted peppers, while some industrial producers use cooked peppers, which leads to a lower quality. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of added chili peppers, it can be sweet, piquant (the most common), or very hot.
 Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread, a side dish, or as a salad.
