 From the Great Big Food Show 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound  bucatini  (tube pasta that looks like spaghetti with a hole down the center of it) 
 salt 
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin  olive oil , 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream 
 ¼ pound, 4 or 5 slices,  pancetta   [1] , chopped 
 1 medium  onion , chopped 
 4 to 6 cloves  garlic , chopped 
 1 teaspoon crushed  red pepper flakes 
 1 (28 ounce) can crushed  tomatoes 
 2 tablespoons chopped  flat-leaf parsley 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 grated  Parmigiano-Reggiano ,  Grana Padano  or  romano , to pass at the table 
 Directions : 
 Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt the water. 
 Heat a large deep skillet over medium high heat. 
 Add oil and pancetta. 
 Cook pancetta 2 or 3 minutes then add onions and garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. 
 Cook 7 or 8 minutes more, until onions are translucent. 
 Add tomatoes and parsley. 
 Season the sauce with salt and pepper. 
 Simmer sauce over low heat until ready to serve. 
 Cook bucatini pasta to al dente or, with a bite to it. 
 Drain pasta well. 
 Do not rinse. 
 Starchy pasta holds more sauce. 
 Toss hot pasta with sauce and serve. 
 Pass grated cheese at the table to top pasta. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Pancetta is Italian rolled, cured pork, similar to bacon, but not smoked. Look for it at your deli counter. Bacon may be substituted resulting in a smoky tomato sauce.
