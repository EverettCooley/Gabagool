Yummy Ginger Cake Prep: 15 min, Cook: 30 min. 
 
    *   1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  
   *   1/2 cup sugar  
   *   1/4 cup molasses  
   *   1/4 cup sour cream  
   *   1 egg  
   *   3/4 cup all purpose flour  
   *   1/2 tsp. baking powder  
   *   1/4 tsp. baking soda  
   *   1/4 tsp. salt (necessary)  
   *   3/4 tsp. ground ginger 
   1 jar Smuckers * Pecan Syrup ice cream topping
 
 Preheat oven to 350ï¿½F. Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat with an 
electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add molasses and sour cream and mix 
thoroughly. Add egg and beat until mixed thoroughly. Combine next 5 ingredients 
 
 in a bowl. Add to wet ingredients and beat until mixture is smooth. Transfer 
 
 to a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Bake 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean 
when inserted in center. Cool cake in pan 5 minutes before turning out. Serve 
with a spoon of topping that has been warmed in the microwave--you can just 
warm it up in the jar with the lid loosened then dip out what you want and 
reseal and put in fridge..
