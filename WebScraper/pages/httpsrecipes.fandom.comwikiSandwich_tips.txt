 Sandwich tips : 
 If you're making grilled sandwiches, follow these quick tips to keep'em easy-to-eat:
 
 Use firm bread that won't disintegrate when you pile on the ingredients. 
 Slice vegetables, meats and cheeses evenly and on the thin side so that they stack up well. 
 For skillet sandwiches, press the sandwich down in the skillet to keep it compact and to ensure that the cheese melts evenly. If the sandwich is not too tall, you can push it down with your hand; if it's bulky, weight it down with a small skillet or a large onion or potato. 
 Once the sandwich is made, don't mess it up when you cut it. Use a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion. Don't push down; let the knife do the work.
