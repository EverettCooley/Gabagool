 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 1 tablespoon rosemary 
 red pepper flakes 
 4 servings

 Place milk in a deep bowl, add pepper flakes and rosemary. 
 Season meat with black and cayenne peppers. 
 Place meat in the bowl, add milk as needed to cover. 
 Let marinate 3-4 hours. 
 Remove meat from marinade, discard marinade. 
 Pat the meat dry and re-season, if desired, with black and red peppers.
