 Description : 
 Stuffed tomatoes with octopus and rice. This recipe comes from the village of Plomari in Lesvos island. Plomari is famous for its  ouzo . The recipe serves 4 persons.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 medium size  tomatoes 
 1 kg  octopus , cut in very small pieces 
 1  onion , finely chopped 
 4  potatoes , cut in small pieces 
 1 tea cup  rice 
 2 spoons  tomato paste 
 3  chestnuts , cut in small pieces 
 some  pine nuts 
 pinch of  cinnamon 
 olive oil 
 salt 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Slice-off the top of the  tomatoes . 
 Use a spoon to remove their inside part. Try to leave the empty  tomatoes  as thin as possible but be careful not to score their skin. Save the inside part of the  tomatoes . It will be used for the stuffing. 
 Add  salt  and  pepper  to taste in the inner part of the empty  tomatoes  and place the  tomatoes  in a baking pan. 
 Surround them with the  potatoes . 
 Stuffing : 
 Heat  olive oil  in a large pan and sauté the  onions  with the  octopus  pieces. 
 Add the  tomato  you have preserved,  tomato paste ,  chestnuts , pine nuts,  cinnamon ,  rice  and  salt  and  pepper  for taste. 
 Stir well and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. 
 Remove from heat and start stuffing the  tomatoes  with a small spoon. Do not over-stuff because the  rice  will gain more space during baking and the stuffing might overflow. 
 Add plenty of  olive oil  into the baking pan and bake in 200 °C for 1 hour without adding any  water  during baking.
