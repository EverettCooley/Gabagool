 Knead the mixture vigorously by hand or in a food processor, making sure that it is very soft and pasty. 
 Divide the mixture into six equal portions and flatten each on a board into a rectangular shape. About 1Â cm.

 Brush the rolls with the melted  margarine  and  oil  mixture, sprinkle with about 3 Tbsp. of  water  and bake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes or longer, depending on the thickness of the rolls. 
 Transfer the meat rolls to a preheated serving dish, garnish with chopped  parsley  and  lemon  slices and serve hot, accompanied by  rice  or sauteed  potatoes .
