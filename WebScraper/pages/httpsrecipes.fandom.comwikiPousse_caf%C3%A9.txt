This French term literally means push the coffee, and in France refers in general to cordials, brandies, etc. that might be served after dinner with coffee. 
 In the United States, it refers to a very elaborate, multicolored after-dinner drink made by layering various liqueurs on top of one another without disturbing the layer below. A slender liqueur glass is used and the heaviest (usually the sweetest) liqueurs are poured in first.
