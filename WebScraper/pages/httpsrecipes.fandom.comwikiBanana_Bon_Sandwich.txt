 Ingredients : 
 
 Banana 
 Chocolate 
 Two pieces of  toast 
 
 Directions : 
 
 Pop two pieces of bread in the toaster. 
 While that's cooking, get a banana and some chocolate. Chocolate syrup would probably work best. 
 Peel the banana and pour some chocolate syrup onto it. 
 When the toast is done, put a slice on a plate. 
 Take a butter knife and slice the banana onto the sandwich. 
 Add about 5 more drops of chocolate syrup. 
 Put the other slice on top and put everything away.
