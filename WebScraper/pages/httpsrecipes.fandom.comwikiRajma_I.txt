 Description : 
 Kidney beans  make an excellent nutritous basis for a vegetarian dish - and this is a popular Indian method for cooking them. Called " rajma " - the kidnet beans are cooked either on their own - or in this Punjabi variation - with  potatoes .
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2 tins of drained  red kidney beans  in  water  (preferably no  salt  added) 
 2 medium sized  potatoes  - chopped into bite-sized chunks 
 1 tin of  plum tomatoes  - chopped - or a ready chopped tin of  tomatoes 
 2 smallish  onions  - finely chopped 
 Some chopped fresh  coriander leaf 
 Some chunks of  garlic  and  ginger  pulp from your freezer 
 2 teaspoons of  garam masala 
 1 teaspoon haldi ( turmeric ) 
 1.5 teaspoon of  salt 
 1 teaspoon of  ground coriander 
 1 teaspoon of  red chile powder 
 Directions : 
 Fry the chopped  onions  in about 2 tablespoons of  oil  until slightly golden brown. Then toss in the  garlic  and  ginger  pulp - and fry for a few minutes more.
 
       Fry the onions until slightly browned     
         Add the garlic & ginger pulp and fry     
 Then add the tin of chopped  tomatoes  - and fry for some more time - until you start to see the  oil  separating from the mixture.
 
         Add all the dry spices and stir fry for a few mins     
         Should look a bit like this     
 Then add the  Potato  chunks and give it a good stir around. Add a glass of cold  water  and bring to the boil - and let it simmer with the lid on for about 10 minutes. this will partly-cook the  Potato .
 
         Then add the tin of chopped tomatoes     
         Fry the mixture for a few minutes     
 Then add the drained tins of cooked  kidney beans . (MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALREADY COOKED  kidney beans  - as these beans are poisonous if not soaked in  water  overnight before cooking!). Then add some more  water  - perhaps a couple of glassed - and bring to boil and let simmer for around 20 minutes - with the lid off - so that the  water  slowly evaporates.
 
         Add the potato chunks     
         Stir and break up as eggs start to set     
 When it's of the consistency that you like - stir in the chopped coriander and simmer for a few mor minutes.
 
         Add the kidney beans     
         Add some more water and let it simmer for 20 mins     
 At this point you can switch off the heat - and put the lid back on whilst you go prepare some  rice  or some some roti - or naan/pitta bread - or even toast. Best served with a cool side-salad - and a glass of your favourite  red wine !
 
         Stir In the chopped coriander and let it simmer for a few minutes more
