Description : 
 I never use this recipe, but it is a TNT recipe. I make teriyaki sauce to taste (see notes below) the way my mom taught me (we are Japanese).
But this is a basic recipe that can be used as a reference for someone who doesn't know how to make it.

 Makes 8 servings 
 Ingredients : 
 3 – 4 pounds boneless  chicken  or  beef , sliced into serving sized pieces 
 Marinade : 
 1½ cups  water 
 1 cup  soy sauce 
 1 cup  sugar 
 2½ teaspoons  mirin  (rice wine vinegar) or  sake 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1-inch piece fresh  ginger  root, crushed or roughly grated 
 Directions : 
 Combine marinade ingredients and pour over chicken. 
 Marinate in the refrigerator at least 24 hours. 
 Grill in skillet or on a flat grill. 
 Notes : 
 To just make the teriyaki sauce, leave out the water. The water is for the marinade only. I don't add water, even for a marinade. 
 If you cannot find mirin or sake, you can sub with sherry, but it won't be as good. 
 Most Japanese make teriyaki sauce with equal amounts of soy sauce and sugar and add garlic and ginger to taste with a splash of mirin or sake (rice wine). No recipe, just what suits their taste. 
 Chicken, beef, pork, seafood (salmon and shrimp especially) are all good with teriyaki sauce. It's a very versatile marinade that can be used for nearly any protein.
