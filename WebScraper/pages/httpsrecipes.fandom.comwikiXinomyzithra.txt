 Xinomyzithra (Greek: Μυζήθρα, feminine gender) is an aged version of the Greek cheese,  Myzithra . It has a strong flavor and a firm texture, which makes it a good grating cheese. It is made from ewe and/or goat milk that has been heated to a moderate temperature for 10 minutes. Rennet is then added and a pinch of salt while ruffling. The mix is left in large shallow tanks resulting in a part skim mixture. The following day, fresh milk and a pinch of salt is added, then the mix is boiled for 5-10 minutes, while ruffling. This is repeated for another 2-3 days. The mix then is poured into α basket with tulle inside and is left to drain for a few hours.
 It comes in various sizes and its shape is usually truncated cone or ball. The cheese is soft, snow-white, creamy, and moist, with a sour taste.
 It is most common to be eaten as dessert with honey. It is used as a table cheese, as well as in salads, pastries and in baking, notably in little cheese pies (handful size).
