      Cumberland Sausage     
 Ingredients : 
 450 g (1 lb)  shoulder of pork , boned and skinned, cut into strips 
 175 g (6 oz) hard back  pork fat , cut into strips 
 rasher smoked  bacon , cut into strips 
 1 tsp  nutmeg 
 1 tsp  mace 
 25 g (1 oz) white  breadcrumbs , soaked in 8 tbsp hot  water 
 sausage  skins 
 Directions : 
 Coarsely mince the  pork , fat and  bacon , then mince with a medium blade. Add the spices and breadcrumbs and mix well, set aside, covered. 
 Rinse the  salt  from the  sausage  skins. Ease one end of a piece of skin on to the cold tap. Run cold  water  gently through the skin, to make sure there are no splits or large holes. Turn off the tap, remove the skin and ease it onto the long spout of the sausage-making attachment to the mincing machine. Screw the whole thing on to the mincing machine with a coarse blade in position. 
 Feed the  pork  sausage meat through the mincing machine again, and as it comes through, slide the skin gently off the attachment and coil it on a large plate. Do not divide into links. 
 Leave in the fridge until the next day. Bake the whole coil for 30 – 45 minutes at 180°C / 350°F / gas 4.
