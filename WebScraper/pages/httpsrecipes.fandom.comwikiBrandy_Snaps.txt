 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 65 ml  butter  or  margarine 
 75 ml  castor sugar 
 60 g  black treacle 
 5 ml  lemon juice 
 125 ml  cake flour , sifted 
 2 ml  salt 
 5 ml  ground ginger 
 Directions : 
 Place the  butter  or  margarine ,  castor sugar ,  treacle  and  lemon juice  in a saucepan and simmer over moderate heat until the  butter  has melted, stirring occasionally. Remove from the stove. Add the  flour ,  salt  and  ginger  and mix well. 
 Drop 2 - 3 teaspoonfuls of the batter, 12 cm apart, on well-greased baking sheets and bake at 190 °C for about 5 minutes, or until rich brown and well spread out. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the  brandy   snaps  to cool for no more than 1 minute. While still warm, wrap each biscuit around the handle of a wooden spoon to make a roll. Allow them to firm before removing the handle and lifting them onto a wire rack to cool completely. 
 Repeat with the remaining batter. Store in an airtight container until needed, then serve filled with  whipped cream  laced with  brandy .
