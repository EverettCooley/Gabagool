 Wikipedia Article  About Land Cress on Wikipedia 
 Land cress (Barbarea verna), also known as Belle Isle cress, Early yellowrocket and American cress, is a biennial herb in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Southwestern Europe, but is also cultivated in Florida. As it requires less water than watercress, it is easier to cultivate. Land cress has been cultivated as a leaf vegetable in England since the 17th century.
 Land cress is considered a satisfactory substitute for watercress. It can be used in sandwiches, or salads, or cooked like spinach, or used in soup.
 Synonyms include Barbarea praecox and Lepidum nativum. Other common names include Belle Isle cress, Early yellowrocket, American cress, dryland cress, upland cress, cassabully, creasy salad, Early winter cress, American cress and American watercress.
