 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Fresh Gourmet  Pork  Sausages. 
 Pork  Chops 
 Beef  Short Ribs 
 Skirt  Steak 
 Cut-up  Chicken  with bones 
 salt 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Season all the meats except the sausages with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Fire up your grill so that all the coals give off an even medium temperature. You want all your meats to be well browned and slightly crispy NOT blackened. The meats should be grilled at a slow but reasonable time in order for them to be cooked in their own juices. Place the  Chicken , sausages, and  Pork  before anything else since they take longer to cook. When the meat is cooked to your preference then serve immediately. 
 Be sure to accompany your meats with a bowl of Chimichurri sauce at the table.
