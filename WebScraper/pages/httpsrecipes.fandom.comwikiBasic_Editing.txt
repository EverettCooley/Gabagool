 Editing in General : 
 This is a wiki, which means that anyone can easily edit any article and have those changes posted immediately to that page. 
 Editing  a page is quite simple. Just click on the " edit " tab at the top of a page (the edit tab is above the page's title). This will bring you to a page with a text box containing the editable text of that page.  If you just want to experiment, please do so in the  Sandbox  instead of on other pages. 
 
 Note:  If a page is broken down into sections, there will also be  edit  links on the right of each section. 
 
 
 Wiki markup : 
 The  wiki markup  is the syntax system you can use to format a page.
 In the left column of the table below, you can see what effects are possible. In the right column, you can see how those effects were achieved. In other words, to make text look like it looks in the left column, type it in the format you see in the right column. 
 You may want to keep this page open in a separate browser window for reference, or take a screen-shot of it. 
 If you want to try out things without danger of doing any harm, you can do so in the  Sandbox . Try opening the Sandbox in a separate window or tab and keeping this page open for reference.
 
 Basic text formatting: Italicizing/Bolding Text; Starting new paragraphs/lines : 
 
 
 What it looks like
 
 What you type
 
 
 
 You can  emphasize text  by putting two
apostrophes on each side. Three apostrophes
will emphasize it  strongly . Five
apostrophes is  even stronger .
 
 
 You can ''emphasize text'' by putting two
apostrophes on each side. Three apostrophes
will emphasize it '''strongly'''. Five
apostrophes is '''''even stronger'''''.
 
 
 
 
 A single new line
has no effect
on the layout.
 But an empty line
starts a new paragraph.

 You can break lines 
without starting a new paragraph. 
Please use this sparingly.

 Organizing your writing: Creating sections, subsections, and lists; Indenting lines :

 Section headings 
 Headings organize your writing into sections.
The Wiki software can automatically generate
a table of contents from them.
 
 Subsection 
 Using more equals signs creates a subsection.
 
 A smaller subsection 
 Don't skip levels, like from two to four equals signs.
Start with two equals signs; don't use single equals signs.

 Unordered lists  are easy to do:
 Start every line with a star.
 More stars indicate a deeper level. 
 A new line 
 in a list 
 marks the end of the list.
 
 Of course you can start again.

 Numbered lists are also good:
 Very organized 
 Easy to follow 
 A new line marks the end of the list.
 
 New numbering starts with 1.

 You can even do mixed lists
 and nest them
 or break lines in lists.

*# and nest them
*#* or break lines<br>in lists. 
 
 
 
 Another kind of list is a  definition list :
 
 word 
 definition of the word 
 longer phrase 
 phrase defined 
 
 Another kind of list is a '''definition list''':
; wordÂ : definition of the word
; longer phrase 
: phrase defined 
 
 
 
 A colon indents a line or paragraph.
 Two colons indent it even further. 
 A newline after that starts a new paragraph.
 
 
 :A colon indents a line or paragraph.
::Two colons indent it even further.
A new line after that starts a new paragraph.
 
 
 
 
 You can make horizontal dividing lines
to separate text.
 
 
 But you should usually use sections instead,
so that they go in the table of contents.

 Here's a link to a page named  Barbecuing .
 You can put formatting around a link.
Example:  Barbecuing .
 The  first letter  will automatically be capitalized,
so  barbecuing  goes to the same place as  Barbecuing .
 Capitalization matters after the first letter. 
 Robert Lefkowitz  is a page that doesn't exist yet. 
You can create it by clicking on the link (but please do not do so with this particular link).
