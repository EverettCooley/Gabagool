 Almond essence is a concentrated flavoring made from the combination of almond oil with alcohol. It is used as a flavoring in many recipes, especially cakes and pastries and it can be purchased in various sized bottles. It is best to purchase a small bottle because if it is seldom used, evaporation of the alcohol over time may result in the flavor becoming even more concentrated. For this reason, it is important to keep the bottle tightly closed.
