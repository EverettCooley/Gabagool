Description : 
       Artichokes stuffed with Tuna Fish and Celery Salad     
 This recipe is for 4 serves.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 large  artichokes 
 1  lemon , halved, and one-half cut into slices 
 2 tablespoons  salt 
 6½ ounces water-packed  tuna , well drained 
 1 hard-cooked  egg , coarsely chopped 
 2 tablespoons finely chopped  onion 
 3 tablespoons finely diced  celery 
 ½ cup  mayonnaise , preferably homemade 
 freshly ground  black pepper , to taste 
 8  lettuce  leaves, patted dry 
 1 ripe  tomato , cut into 8 wedges 
 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh  parsley 
 Directions : 
 Using a sharp stainless-steel knife, trim off the  artichoke  stems and slice 1 inch off the top. 
 Rub the cuts with the  lemon  half. 
 Place the artichokes, stem side down, in a large nonreactive pot and cover with  water . 
 Add the  salt  and 4  lemon  slices. 
 Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and boil gently uncovered until tender, 35 to 45 minutes. 
 To test doneness, pull a leaf out; if it comes out easily without resistance, the  artichoke  is done. 
 Drain the artichokes upside down in a colander or on a rack. 
 When cool enough to handle, discard all the green leaves, scraping off and saving all the edible parts in a small bowl. 
 Scoop out the fuzzy choke with a small spoon. 
 Trim the bottom to a nice round shape. 
 Combine the  tuna ,  onion ,  celery , and reserved  artichoke  pieces in a medium bowl. 
 Add the  mayonnaise  and  black pepper ; toss gently with a fork. 
 Adjust the seasoning. 
 Stuff the  artichoke  bottoms with the  tuna  and  celery  salad. 
 Arrange the  lettuce  on a serving platter. 
 Place the stuffed artichokes on top of the  lettuce , and garnish with the  tomato  wedges and  parsley .
