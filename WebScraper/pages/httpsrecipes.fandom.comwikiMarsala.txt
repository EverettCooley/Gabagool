 Wikipedia Article  About Marsala on Wikipedia 
 Marsala is the name for a wine produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily. Marsala wine has Denominazione di origine controllata, or DOC, status.
 While the city's natives sometimes drink "vintage" Marsala, the wine produced for export is universally a fortified wine. Marsala wine was originally fortified with ethyl alcohol to ensure that it would last long ocean voyages, but it is made that way now due to its popularity in foreign markets.
