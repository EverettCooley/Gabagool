Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup uncooked  white beans 
 1 tablespoon  lard 
 3 pounds of  beef  oxtails 
 3 cloves of  garlic , peeled and crushed 
 1 medium  yellow onion , peeled and diced 
 1 medium  tomato , diced 
 2 cups of  beef stock 
 2 cups of  water  (about) 
 2 tablespoons ground  allspice 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 few shots of  hot sauce 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  beans  in cold  water  overnight OR place  beans  in a small saucepan with 1 cup of  water  and cover. Bring to a boil and turn of heat. Allow to sit for 1 hour covered with the heat off. 
 In a heavy skillet brown the oxtails in  lard . Place them in a large (about 6 quart) stove top casserole or stock pot. Add all the remaining ingredients except the  water  and  beans . Then, add just enough  water  to cover the contents of the pot, this should be about 2 cups more or less. 
 Cover and simmer for 1½ hours. Drain the  beans  and add to the stock pot. Continue cooking covered for an additional 1½ hours. Stir occasionally and add additional  water  if necessary, you do not want the pot to dry out. If you like a thick stew, remove the lid during the last half hour of cooking.
