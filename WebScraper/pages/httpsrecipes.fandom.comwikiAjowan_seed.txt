 About Ajwain : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Ajwain on Wikipedia 
 Ajwain (also known as Carom, Ajowan, Bishop's Weed and Seeds Of Bishop's Weed), is an uncommon spice except in certain areas of Asia. It is the small seed-like fruit of the Bishop's Weed plant, (Trachyspermum ammi syn. Carum copticum), egg-shaped and grayish in colour. The plant has a similarity to parsley.
 Ajwain is often confused with lovage seed; even some dictionaries mistakenly state that ajwain comes from the lovage plant.
