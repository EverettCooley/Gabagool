 About Sesame salt : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Sesame salt on Wikipedia 
 Gomashio (ごま塩) is a natural flavoring, similar to furikake, made from sesame (ごま, goma) and salt (塩, shio). It is often used in Japanese cuisine, such as a topping for sekihan. It is also sometimes sprinkled over plain rice or over an onigiri.
 Gomashio is also used in the Japanese language to refer to describe a head of hair containing both gray and black hair strands that intermingle.
