 Serves three to four. 
 Ingredients : 
 100 g  unsalted butter  at room temperature 
 grated zest of 1  lime 
 1½ tbsp  lime juice 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  white pepper 
 1 tbsp chopped  coriander 
 ½  garlic  clove, finely chopped 
 ¼ tsp  chilli flakes 
 250 g  spinach , washed 
 110 g  self-raising flour 
 1 tbsp  baking powder 
 1 free-range  egg 
 50 g  unsalted butter , melted 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tsp ground  cumin 
 150 ml  milk 
 6  spring onions , finely sliced 
 2  green chillies , thinly sliced 
 1 free-range  egg white 
 olive oil , for frying 
 Directions : 
 Put 100 g butter in a bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until creamy. 
 Stir in the zest, lime juice, salt, pepper, coriander, garlic and chilli. 
 Tip out on to a sheet of clingfilm, roll into a sausage, twist the ends to seal and chill. 
 Wilt the spinach in a pan with a splash of water. 
 Drain and, when cool, squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. 
 Chop and set aside. 
 Put the flour, baking powder, whole egg, melted butter, salt, cumin and milk in a bowl and whisk until smooth. 
 Add the onions, chillies and spinach, and mix in. 
 Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and gently fold in. 
 Pour a little olive oil into a heavy frying pan and place on a medium–high heat. 
 For each pancake, ladle in two tablespoons of batter and press down gently. 
 You should get smallish pancakes about 7 cm in diameter and 1cm thick. 
 Cook for two minutes a side, until you get a good golden-green colour. 
 Transfer to kitchen paper and keep warm. 
 Repeat, adding oil to the pan as needed, until the batter is used up. 
 To serve, pile up three warm pancakes per person and place a slice of flavoured butter on top to melt.
