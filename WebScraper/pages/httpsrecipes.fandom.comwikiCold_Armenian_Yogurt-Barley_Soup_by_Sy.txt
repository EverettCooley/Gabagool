 Description : 
 This delicious  yogurt  soup just "Hits The Spot" on a hot summers day! You can find variations of this recipe from Eastern Europe to the Middle East. I especially loved the  yogurts  in  Turkey , Iran and Greece. If possible, try making your own home made  yogurt . I use a Salton  yogurt  Maker and the  yogurt  comes out rich and creamy. However, a good substitute is the Greek  yogurts  found in some of the bigger supermarkets. 
 
 
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups rich creamy high fat content  yogurt 
 2 cups already made  Barley  (cold) 
 water  (cold) 
 salt , pinch of 
 dried  mint  (not the fresh  mint  leaves) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In individual bowls add 1 cup of  yogurt , some  Barley , a pinch of  salt  and  water . 
 Mix into a nice medium thick consistency (like the thickness of  buttermilk ) Sprinkle some dried  mint  leaves on top. 
 Enjoy.
