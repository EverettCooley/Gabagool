Description : 
       Pulla     
 Finnish cardamon coffee bread (for 2 pound breadmaker). This is a bread machine version of Finnish Pulla, which tastes just like my grandmother's Swedish  cardamom  bread. It's yummy. My bread machine calls for the dry stuff in the pan first, which is what I did (as opposed to the way the directions read) and it turned out fine.
