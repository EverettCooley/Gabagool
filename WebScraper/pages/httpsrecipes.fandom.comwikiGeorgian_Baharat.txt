Description : 
 Georgian mixed spices
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup whole  black peppercorns 
 ¼ cup whole  coriander seeds 
 ¼ cup  cassia  or  cinnamon  bark 
 ¼ cup whole cloves 
 ⅓ cup  cumin  seeds 
 2 teaspoons whole  cardamom  seeds 
 4 whole nutmegs 
 ½ cup ground  paprika 
 Directions : 
 Basically, just place all the spices except the  paprika  and  nutmeg  in a blender or adequate grinder and process until it becomes a powder. If necessary you can grind ½ cup at a time. 
 Grate the  nutmeg  and blend this with the  paprika  into the spices. 
 Store in an airtight jar. 
 Generally in some areas, they lightly toast the spices in an oven to bring out more flavor. 
 You can gain this also by putting the amount you're going to use, on a hot dry frypan and toast it for a few seconds before using. 
 This not only makes the kitchen smell good, but brings out a richer flavor of any spice. 
 You can also use ground spices, but using them whole is the authentic way. 
 Four nutmegs come to about ¼ cup ground. 
 Be careful how much  nutmeg  you use; it's toxic in large doses.
