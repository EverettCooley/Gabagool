      Preserved "turnip" root     
 About preserved "turnip" root : 
 In this form it's much more obvious that "turnip" means " daikon  radish". The photo specimens were packaged as whole roots but more commonly they are packaged as cut strips. A somewhat shorter, stubbier variety than the long carrot shaped Japanese daikon is used. This is a salt fermented pickle which is soft and flexible but retains quite a bit of crunchiness. Once the vac-pac plastic bag is opened, it should be kept tightly sealed and refrigerated, where it will keep for many months. Ingredients: "Turnip", salt, water.
