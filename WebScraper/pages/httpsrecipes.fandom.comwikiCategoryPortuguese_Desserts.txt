 Portuguese desserts are quite famous all over Europe, and they are starting to become popular overseas as well. Egg-based desserts spiced up with different seasonings and flavors (vanilla, cinnamon) make the delight of any Portuguese meal. Whether it is rice pudding (arroz doce) or leite-crème the Portuguese chefs will definitely have a tasty desert for any sort of meal. A dessert similar to crème caramel is pudim flan and in traditional Portuguese homes you will often pastry and cookies served after each lunch, as desserts. Custard tarts are another favorite Portuguese dessert.
