 Brisket  is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest. While all meat animals have a brisket, the term is most often used to describe  beef  and sometimes  veal . The beef brisket is just one of the eight beef primal cuts. According to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, the term derives from the Middle English "brusket" which comes from the earlier Old Norse "brj√≥sk", meaning cartilage. The cut overlies the sternum, ribs, and the connecting, costal cartilages.
