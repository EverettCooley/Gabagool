 1 ½ lb.  eggplant , cut into ½" cubes 
 1 large  onion , chopped or minced 
 2 tbsp.  soy sauce  or  Tamari 
 2 tsp.  sesame oil  (optional) 
 ⅓ cup  water 
 1 tsp.  sugar 
 3 tbsp.  olive oil  or  vegetable broth 
 8 cloves minced  garlic 
 1 tbsp. mixed  chili paste  with garlic (or plain chili paste) 
 ½ tsp. minced  ginger  (I usually add more than this) 
 Directions : 
 In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, water and sugar. 
 Add olive oil, garlic, chili paste and ginger to the heated wok, and cook for a few seconds, stirring constantly. 
 Add eggplants and onions 
 Pour soy sauce mixture over eggplant and toss well. 
 Add enough water so that liquid comes halfway up the eggplant mixture. 
 Cover tightly and allow to cook 
 When eggplant is tender, uncover and cook until most of the remaining sauce has evaporated.
