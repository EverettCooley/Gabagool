Link: https://recipes.fandom.com/wiki/Category_talk:Clove_Recipes

i have noticed that many of the recipes referred to from this page have a 'clove of garlic' rather than the spice 'clove' - there needs to be some distinction in the coding...  I have no idea how.
 I suppose that the search returns all recipies with the string 'clove' but of cours that includes the garlic pages.  Can perhaps the search differentiate if the adjoining word was 'garlic'?
