 Combine the ¼ cup milk and cooking oil; add to flour mixture, stirring just until combined.

 Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. 
 Drop dumpling batter from a tablespoon to make 4 mounds atop bubbling chicken mixture. 
 Cover loosely (do not lock lid) and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near center of dumpling comes out clean.
