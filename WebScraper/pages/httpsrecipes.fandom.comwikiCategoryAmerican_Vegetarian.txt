 The most important cause that determines people to become vegetarian is the idea that meat contains toxic substances. This might be true, but the meat is also one of the main sources of proteins. It is believed that the consumption of vegetables and fruits increase the life expectancy. While the vegetables should be a part of every diet, the vegetarians choose other sources of proteins, such as legumes and nuts. 
 American cuisine contains many recipes that should be appreciated by vegetarians. Everything, from appetizers, soups to snacks and desserts can be made with other ingredients than dairy products or meat. 	
 	 Some famous recipes based on vegetables are: Chicago-style pizza, Banana kiwi pudding, Spicy Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Angel biscuits.
