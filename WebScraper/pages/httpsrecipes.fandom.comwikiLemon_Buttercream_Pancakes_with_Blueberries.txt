Description : 
 Nothing can describe these, they are wonderful. My guys always have these with fresh blueberries, I like them plain but have done then with strawberries and raspberries. The work equally well with any berry. From a travelers website.. Posted to RecipeZaar but modified by BL Olson to be gluten and casein free.
