 The Wiener Schnitzel is probably the best-known Austrian food all over the world. It has Italian origins and was adapted further, in the other countries. Tafelspitz is the name of another Austrian meat-based food. It contains boiled beef with apples and sauce of horseradish. Selchfleisch is the Austrian smoked meat, which is prepared with spices. However, the meat dishes aren't always main dishes. Beef soups, such as Rindsuppe are prepared often in an Austrian kitchen. Besides meat, people use organs in their foods. One of the most famous dishes in Austria is Beuschel, which is made from calf lungs and heart.
