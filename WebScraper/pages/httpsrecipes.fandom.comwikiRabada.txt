 Ingredients : 
 4 lbs of  oxtail  cut up 
 1 cup of  lemon juice 
 1 cup of  cachaça  (or  vodka ) 
 ½ cup  oil 
 5 cloves of  garlic  minced 
 2 diced  onions 
 2 cups chopped  celery 
 1 cup grated  carrot 
 4  bay leaves 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 red pepper (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Rinse the oxtail and place in a large saucepan with the  lemon juice  and  cachaca . 
 Cover the oxtail with  water  and boil for about 10 minutes. 
 Place the oxtail in a colander to discard the  water  and set aside the oxtail. 
 Combine in the saucepan the ½ cup of  oil ,  garlic ,  onions ,  salt  and fry the previously cooked oxtail until golden brown, about 10 minutes. 
 Drain the excess of fat. 
 This is the “refogar” process. 
 Then pour  water  slowly while cooking to make a sauce. 
 Combine the  bay leaves ,  carrot  and  celery  and red pepper if you like. 
 Add  water  enough to partially cover the oxtail and make a sauce. 
 Taste to see if you need to add more  salt . 
 And finish cooking, the  meat  should be tender but still attached to the bones.
