Description : 
 This dish is my ultimate comfort food. Its commonly eaten in winter and during the month of Ramadan for the predawn breakfast,but for me its a regular at least 2 or 3 times a month. Its always served with doggos (Saudi salsa). (Note: in Saudi cuisine the thigh and drumstick is not disjointed and is served as one portion).
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¼ kg  chicken , with skin on, disjointed and washed 
 4 cups  water 
 7 green  cardamom  (peel the skin slightly so seeds can fall out) 
 2 teaspoons  salt (to taste) 
 ¾ cup  basmati rice 
 2 cups  milk 
 3 tablespoons  ghee 
 2 pieces  gum arabic  (mastikah do not leave it out) 
 Directions : 
 Boil  chicken  in the  water  with cardamoms and  salt , until soft and tender (1 hour). 
 Remove  chicken  to an oven tray. 
 Strain  chicken broth  into a big bowl and. 
 Pour back into the cooking pot. 
 Add  rice  to the broth, taste for  salt . 
 Cook  rice  till extremely soft and mushy. 
 Add  milk  and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring continually on low heat. 
 Heat  ghee  and mastikah in a saucepan on the stove till mastikah melts (it would not work in the microwave). 
 Add melted mastikah to the  rice  and mix well. 
 Switch heat off close pot and rest for 10 minutes.
