 About Banana pepper : 
 The banana pepper is a member of the chili pepper family, often served pickled on sandwiches. It is a variety of the species Capsicum annuum. Its shape and color resembles a banana. Its flavor is mild to moderately hot (0-500 Scoville units), and as is the case with most peppers, its hotness depends on the maturity of the pepper, with the most ripe being sweeter than younger ones.
 Banana peppers are typically yellow, but can also be orange or red. Yellow peppers are generally served pickled and tend to have a flavor similar to a vinegary sweet pickle.
