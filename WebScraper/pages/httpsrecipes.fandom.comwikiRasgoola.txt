Description : 
 how to make rasgoola
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 ltr Homogenized  milk 
 2 tsp  white vinegar 
 1 1/2 C  Sugar 
 3 C  water 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  milk  to a boil and add  vinegar  to the boiling  milk  to separate the whey. 
 Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff onto a muslin cloth. 
 Pour some cold  water  over the curd to cool and wash it. 
 Discard the  water  and hang the cloth for 15–20 minutes to let the excess  water  drip off. 
 Put the curd in a food processor or blender and blend at high speed to get a smooth consistency. 
 You may add just a little (1 tsp or so)  water  while blending, if the curd is too dry and will not blend. 
 Be very careful so as not to add any extra  water . Remove the paste and make small balls (1-2" in diameter). 
 Boil  water  in a wide vessel. Make sure that there is at least 2-3" of  water  in the vessel. 
 If not, add more  water  and increase the quantity of  Sugar  proportionately. 
 Add  Sugar  to the boiling  water  to make a light syrup. 
 Continue boiling the syrup and gently drop the curd balls in the boiling syrup. 
 Cook the balls in the boiling syrup for 30–40 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the stuff cool down. 
 Put the balls and the syrup in a storage container and refrigerate (don't freeze). Serve cold.
