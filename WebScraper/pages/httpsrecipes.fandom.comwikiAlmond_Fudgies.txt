Almond Fudgies
 8 oz. unsweetened chocolate
1 C. butter
5 large eggs
1 T. vanilla extract
2 tsp. almond extract
3 3/4 C. sugar
1 2/3 C. all-purpose flour
 Preheat oven to 350ï¿½F. Line an 11 x 9-inch pan with aluminum foil 
leaving a little overhang around the edges of the pan. Butter the 
foil.
 Melt the chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over low heat, 
watching carefully and stirring occasionally, just until smooth or 
you can do this step in a double boiler.
 Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs, vanilla, and almond extracts, 
and sugar in a large mixing bowl at the highest speed for about 10 
minutes. The mixture should increase in volume and look like softened 
ice cream. Mix in melted chocolate mixture on low speed just until 
blended. Add the flour.Stir until just mixed. 
 Turn brownie mix into prepared pan. Bake in the center of the oven 
just until a hard crust forms on top and the edges are very slightly 
browned, about 18 to 22 minutes. The batter underneath will be runny 
and under baked by normal baking standards. Let the brownies cool to 
room temperature.
 Refrigerate the brownies at least 6 hours or overnight.
 Using the foil,lift brownies from pan. Remove foil and cut into 20 to 
25 squares
