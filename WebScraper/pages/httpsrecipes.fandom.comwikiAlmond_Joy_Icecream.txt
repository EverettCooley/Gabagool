 Description : 
 This is a creamy coconut ice cream, with chocolate and nuts (like my favorite candy bar)! You can add more or less chocolate and almonds depending on your taste...I like a lot!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can coconut milk 
 1 cup cream or half-and-half 
 1/4 cup sugar 
 1/2 cup chopped chocolate 
 1/2 cup chopped almonds 
 Directions : 
 Combine coconut milk, cream, and sugar in a bowl. Mix until the sugar is dissolved. 
 Freeze the milk mixture in an ice cream maker. 
 When the ice cream is the consistency of thick soft serve, fold in the chocolate and nuts.
