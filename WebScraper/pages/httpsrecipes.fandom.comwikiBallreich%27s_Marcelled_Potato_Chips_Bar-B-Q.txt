 Description : 
 Ballreich's   Marcelled Potato Chips Bar-B-Q  are wavy, rippled barbeque flavored potato chips. Reviewers at  taquitos.net  said the chips have "an interesting barbeque taste", as there is a slightly hot aftertaste and the flavor of the barbeque sauce resembles that of pizza sauce.
