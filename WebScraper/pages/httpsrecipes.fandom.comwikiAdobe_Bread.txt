      Adobe Bread     
 Ingredients : 
 1 pkt  active dry yeast , (¼ oz) 
 ¼ cup lukewarm  water 
 1 tsp  salt 
 3 tbsp  vegetable shortening , melted 
 1 cup cold  water 
 4½ cups  all purpose flour 
 Directions : 
 Soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. 
 Mix the salt and the cold water together and add to the yeast mixture. 
 Sift in the flour gradually, beating well after each addition for a smooth consistency. 
 You will probably have to knead in the final cup of flour. 
 Shape the dough into a ball, brush lightly with the remaining shortening, and cover with a dry cloth. 
 Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. 
 Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5 minutes. 
 Shape into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet. 
 Cover with a dry cloth and set to rise another 45 minutes. 
 Preheat the oven to 400 °F. 
 Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50 minutes.
