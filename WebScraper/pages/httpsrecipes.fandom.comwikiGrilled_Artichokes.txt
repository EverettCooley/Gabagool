 Description : 
 This is a recipe for delicious, asian-inspired, grilled artichokes.
 
 4 large artichokes 
 ¼ cup  balsamic vinegar 
 ¼ cup  water 
 ¼ cup  soy sauce 
 ¼ cup  olive oil 
 1 tablespoon minced  ginger 
 Directions : 
 Slice artichoke tops off, crosswise. Trim stems. 
 Boil or steam artichokes until bottoms pierce easily, or a petal pulls off easily. 
 Drain artichokes and cool. Cut each artichoke in half lengthwise and scrape out fuzzy center and any purple tipped petals. 
 Mix remaining ingredients in a large plastic bag. Place artichokes in the bag and coat all sides of the artichokes. 
 For the best flavor, marinate in the mixture overnight in the refrigerator but marinate at least one hour. 
 Drain artichokes. Place each cut, side down, on a grill over a solid bed of medium coals or a gas grill on medium. Grill until lightly browned on the cut side, 5 to 7 minutes. 
 Turn artichokes over and drizzle some of the remaining marinade over the artichokes. Grill until petal tips are lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes more.
