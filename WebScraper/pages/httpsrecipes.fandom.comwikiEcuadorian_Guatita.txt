 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs  mondongo or librillo 
 4 spoons  peanut butter  (or roasted  peanuts  grounded) 
 1 lb  potatoes 
 3 spoons  achiote  (annato seeds +  oil ) 
 1 small pealed  tomato  without seeds (Osterized  [1] ) 
 1 medium  red onion  (finely chopped) 
 1 small  green pepper  (finely chopped) 
 3  garlic  cloves (Osterized) 
 ½ tsp  oregano 
 salt 
 pepper 
 comino 
 culantro  (a herb similar to  parsley ) 
 ajinomoto ( monosodium glutamate ) 
 Directions : 
 Clean the cow stomach with  water  and  flour , leave it soaking for a while in  water  with  lemon  and clean it again 3 times. 
 After the last cleaning with  lemon  flush it with  water . 
 Boil it in  water  with  salt  and throw away that 1st  water . 
 Boil it again with 5 cups  water , achiote, ajinomoto,  salt   culantro  and  comino , when it's cooked separate the stomach from the soup and filter the soup. 
 Cut the guata (stomach) in 4 squared cm (2 x 2 cm) or 1 squared inch (1"x1") pieces. 
 In a pot make the refrito with the  onion ,  tomato ,  garlic ,  green pepper , achiote,  oil ,  salt ,  comino ,  pepper   oregano  and ajinomoto. 
 Once the refrito is ready put the pieces of guatita in it and let them fry a little. 
 Osterize the  peanut   butter  with 3 cups of soup and add it to the guatita let it boil a while. 
 When the guatita is almost ready add the  potatoes  cuted in small squares. 
 Let boil until the  potatoes  are cooked and the  peanut  thickens, if it thickens to much add a little more soup. 
 This is a main dish, not a soup, so the sauce must be thick.
