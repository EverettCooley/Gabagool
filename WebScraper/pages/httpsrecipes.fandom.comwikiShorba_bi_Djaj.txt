Description : 
 Iraqi creamy chicken soup with rice
 
 Serves 8 
 Ingredients: : 
 ½ cup long-grain rice 
 2 tbsp vegetable oil 
 1 onion, finely chopped 
 1½ pounds chicken wings 
 ½ tsp turmeric 
 ½ tsp ground cardamom 
 1½ tsp salt, or to taste 
 freshly ground pepper to taste 
 10 cups water 
 ½ cup red lentils, well washed 
 Method: : 
 Wash the  rice  well. Place it in a large bowl of cold water and soak for 2 hours, then drain and set aside. In a soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent. Add the chicken, turmeric, cardamom, salt, pepper and water. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and add the rice and lentils. Gently simmer until the rice has softened and the soup has become thick and creamy, about 2 hours (skim off any foam that may rise to the surface, and stir occasionally to make sure that the  rice  does not stick to the bottom of the pot). When the soup is creamy, remove the chicken wings from the pot. Discard the skin and bones, shred the meat, and return it to the pot. Taste and adjust for seasonings. Serve hot.
