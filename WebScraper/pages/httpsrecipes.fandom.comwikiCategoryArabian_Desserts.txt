 In the r cuisine of Arabia the date happens to be the Arabs’ universal stapler. Dates are nutritious as well as are high in calorie value which gets your bowl movments going. In ancient times dates were the very means of survival for nomadic tribes when times were tough, and in the modern day, dates are still the food with which the Bedouin or townsman is likely to begin as well as end his day. Dates and the traditional Arabian coffee are the traditional offering to a caller; dates stuffed with almonds are a popular confection; dates baked into little sugared cookies known as ma’mul are indispensable to the proper celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr, the Islamic festival that marks the end of the Holy month of Ramadan for Muslims.
