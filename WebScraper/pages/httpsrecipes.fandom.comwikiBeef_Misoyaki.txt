      Beef Misoyaki     
 Ingredients : 
 2 (0.8 lbs) boneless  ribeye steaks 
 3½ tablespoons  sesame seeds 
 ½ cup light  miso 
 ⅓ cup  sake  or other dry  white wine 
 1½ tablespoons  sugar 
 1½ tablespoons  soy sauce 
 1½ tablespoons cooking  oil 
 Directions : 
 Freeze steaks for 45 minutes or so until they are firm and partially frozen, then remove excess fat and slice very thin; place in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. 
 In a small skillet, toast  sesame seeds  over high heat, swirling pan, being careful not to burn; remove from heat and cool. 
 Place  sesame seeds  in a mortar and grind finely (but do not grind into a paste) or you may use a small coffee grinder set on pulse. 
 Place  sesame seeds  in a small bowl and mix with  miso ,  soy sauce ,  sugar , and  sake  (it should have the consistency of runny  peanut butter ). 
 Add mixture to meat and work through as a marinade. 
 Allow meat to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
 Heat a large skillet or griddle on high and add a little  oil , and cook  beef  without crowding (you may want to cook half at a time). 
 Cook  beef  about 3–5 minutes or until done to your liking or you may place meat in broiler or grill and cook several minutes or until cooked through. 
 Serve with steamed  rice  if you wish, and a stir-fried vegetable cooked with  ginger  and a little soy goes nicely as well.
