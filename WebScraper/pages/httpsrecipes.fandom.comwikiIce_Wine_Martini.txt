Description : 
 I discovered this martini in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada where it is served in a number of restaurants. Ice wine is made from grapes left to ferment on the vine during winter. So simple and so good. A garnish might be 2 or 3 frozen grapes on a skewer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 oz  ice wine 
 4 oz  vodka 
 Directions : 
 Mix in a cocktail shaker with plenty of crushed ice. 
 Shake vigorously and strain into 2 martini glasses.
