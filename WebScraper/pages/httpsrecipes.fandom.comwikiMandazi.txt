 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 two cups warm  water 
 two teaspoons  baking powder  or one teaspoon  dry yeast 
 four cups  all-purpose flour 
 one-half cup  Sugar 
 one-quarter teaspoon spice 
 two tablespoons  butter ,  margarine , or  vegetable oil 
 one-quarter cup warm  milk  (optional) 
 one  egg , lightly beaten (optional) 
 pinch of  salt 
 oil  for deep frying 
 
 
 Directions : 
 All pastry ingredients should be allowed to come to room temperature if they have been in the refrigerator. If using  yeast : mix the  yeast  with a few spoonfuls of the warm  water . 
 In a mixing bowl combine the  flour ,  baking powder ,  Sugar , and spice ( cardamom  is most common in Eastern Africa). Add the  yeast . Mix the  water ,  butter ,  milk , and  egg  together. Gradually add this mixture to the  flour  while kneading into dough. Knead until a smooth and elastic dough is formedâ€”fifteen to twenty minutes. If using  yeast : Place dough in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to rise in a warm place for an hour or more. If using  baking powder , let dough rest for several minutes. 
 Divide the dough into several hand-sized pieces. Roll or press the pieces into circles about one-half inch thick. Cut circles into halves or quarters (or whatever you like). Some cooks place the doughs on a cookie sheet and let them rise a second time. 
 Heat a few cups of  vegetable oil  to 300 degrees Farenheit in a skillet or deep pot. Fry the doughs in the hot  oil , turning a few times, until they are golden brown all over. Fry only as many together as can float in the  oil  without touching one another. Place on paper towels to drain. Serve warm.
