Polish cuisine is characterized by diversity, a blend of cooking styles that come both from historic Polish regions and from outside influences. The different and distinct regions of Poland also play their part in creating the diverse national Polish cuisine. The famous pierogi are representative for Poland and its culinary tradition. This particular cuisine uses a large variety of ingredients, ranging from meat products to noodles and herbs. As with most cuisines in the central and eastern European areas, cereals are at the basis of the Polish diet. A complete list of Polish dishes may contain thousands upon thousands of recipes which might have originated hundreds of years ago or which might be a product of the highly specialized Polish chefs from modern times.
