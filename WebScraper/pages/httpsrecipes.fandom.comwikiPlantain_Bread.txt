 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 3 large, very ripe  plantains 
 2 teaspoons Fresh  chile  Sambal 
 1 cup  rice flour 
 salt 
 1/4 cup  corn oil 
 2 teaspoons  ground turmeric 
 1 cup salted  peanuts , as accompaniment (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350 F/180 C. 
 Peel the  plantains , cut them into small chunks, and put in a large, deep mixing bowl. Mash into a thick paste with your fingers or an electric blender. If you use a blender, you may need to add 2 to 4 tablespoons  water  for smoother blending. 
 Add the sambal,  rice flour , and  salt  and mix well. Gently heat the  corn oil  in a small skillet and add the  turmeric . Stir well, remove from the heat, and blend it into the  plantain  mixture, which should be thick yet soft enough to pour. If it is too soft, add small amounts of  rice flour  (a tablespoon at a time); if too stiff, add small amounts of  water . 
 Grease a standard loaf pan, and pour the  plantain  mixture into it. Bake for 1 hour, or until cooked and firm. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes before turning it out on a wire rack. 
 Slice and serve with salted  peanuts  or as an accompaniment to other dishes.
