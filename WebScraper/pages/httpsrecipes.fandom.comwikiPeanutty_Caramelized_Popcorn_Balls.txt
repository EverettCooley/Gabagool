Description : 
 Purchased from the Miller Estate in Wylie, Texas in 1994. These are time consuming and very messy. But well worth the effort. I make them for our church bake sale and they always get bought right up. Date and source unknown.

 Ingredients : 
 8 cups  popped corn 
 1 cup  peanuts 
 ¾ cup  white sugar 
 ¾ cup  brown sugar , packed 
 ½ cup  light corn syrup 
 ½ cup  water 
 1 teaspoon  white vinegar 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 ¾ cup  butter 
 Directions : 
 Mix the popped  corn  and  peanuts  in a large bowl. 
 Combine the sugars, syrup,  water ,  vinegar  and  salt  in a saucepan. 
 Heat to boiling, stirring constantly until a small amount of the mixture dropped into very cold  water  forms a hard ball. 
 Reduce heat to low. 
 Add  butter  and stir until melted. 
 Pour the syrup slowly over the  popcorn  and  peanuts , stirring until the  popcorn  is evenly coated. 
 Cool slightly. 
 Grease your hands with more  butter  and shape  popcorn  balls. 
 I do this with wax paper since the caramel can get very hot. 
 Cool and wrap each ball in plastic wrap.
