 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 teaspoon  baking powder 
 salt 
 2 tablespoons  granulated sugar 
 1  egg , beaten 
 2 tablespoons  butter , melted 
 About 1 cup  milk 
 vegetable oil 
 Syrup 
 2 tablespoons  honey 
 1 tablespoon  rum 
 1 (3-inch)  cinnamon  stick 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Sift  flour ,  baking powder  and  salt  into a large bowl. 
 Stir in  Sugar , then add  egg ,  butter  and just enough  milk  to form a soft, but not sticky, dough. 
 Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly until smooth. 
 Divide dough in 8 to 12 pieces; shape each piece into a ball. Cover and let stand 30 minutes. 
 On a lightly floured surface, shape balls into flat cakes. 
 Using the back of a metal spoon, make a shallow indentation in the top of each cake. 
 Heat a deep-fat fryer two-thirds full of  oil  to 375 degrees F. 
 Fry a few cakes at a time for 5 minutes or until golden brown and puffy. Drain on paper towels. 
 Serve fritters in individual bowls topped with syrup. 
 Place all ingredients in a heavy saucepan. 
 Bring slowly to a boil, stirring frequently. 
 Turn heat down and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until mixture thickens to a syrup. 
 Remove  cinnamon  stick. 
 For a more distinct  rum  flavor, you may wish to omit the  rum  while the syrup is cooking, then add the  rum  after you remove the saucepan from the heat.
