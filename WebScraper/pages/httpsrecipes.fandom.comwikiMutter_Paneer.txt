 Description : 
 Mutter Paneer is a delicious  curry  of  Peas  and home-made  Cheese  cubes (paneer). Once again - it's a Punjabi dish - and is extremely tasty when served with roti - or pitta bread: you can choose! And again - it's really easy to make. Just get the following ingredients together:
 
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 1 packet of ready-made paneer cubes from your local Indian shop - about 500g 
 2 medium  onions  chopped finely 
 1 tin of chopped  tomatoes 
 A generous bowl of frozen  Peas 
 The usual chunks  ginger , chillie,  garlic  from your freezer (thawed of course) 
 2 (heaped) teaspoons ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 3 (heaped) teaspoons  garam masala 
 1 and a half teaspoon of haldi ( turmeric ) 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cumin 
 1 pinch of  cumin  seed if you have some 
 Directions : 
 Heat up a couple of tablespoons of veg  oil  in a frying pan until hot and then add the cube sof paneer and fry until golden brown - turning over frequently to ensure even  browning .
 
       Shallow-fry the paneer cubes in oil     
         Fry until golden brown. Turn over frequently     
 When the paneer cubes have browned - place them onto a plate lined with kitchen paper so that the excess  oil  is absorbed away. In the meantime - get a large-ish pot and heat some  vegetable oil  in it until hot - and add the pinch of  cumin  seed and wait until it splutters.
 
         Lay out paneer on kitchen paper     
         Fry some cumin seed in oil until it splutters     
 Then add the chopped  onions  and fry until goldeny-brown. After which add the ground dry spices and fry some more for about 5 mins gently.
 
         Fry onions until golden brownish     
         Add all the ground spices     
 Then when the spices are infused int he  Onion  mixture - and the  oil  begins to separate from the  onions  - add the tin of chopped tomoto - and stir around on highish heat for a few mins.
 
         Add the tin of chopped tomatoes     
         Cook for around 5 mins     
 After about 5 mins of simmering tomato-onion-spice mixture - add about 4 small glasses of  water  to the pot - and bring to simmer. Then add the previously-fried cubes of paneer to the pot and let it simmer for a few minutes more.
 
         Add 3 or 4 glasses of water     
         Add the paneer cubes to the pot     
 Then add the bowl of frozen  Peas  - mix it about and simmer with the lid partially on for about 20 mins - stirring occasionally. The paneer cubes - which started out as "stodgy" plain  Cheese  pieces should by now be of a texture a bit like sponge - and should have absorbed the  masala  flavours too.
 
         Add the frozen peas     
         Simmer for around 15 mins     
 When the "soup" in the pot is of the consistency that you prefer - simmering with the lid off to let some  water  evaporate - then just stir in some freshly chopped  coriander leaf  if - and switch the flame off - put the lid on - and then go and prepare some pitta bread or toast - or whatever - to accompany the mutter paneer.
 Congratulate yourself for preparing such an enjoyable dish! And enjoy eating it too!
