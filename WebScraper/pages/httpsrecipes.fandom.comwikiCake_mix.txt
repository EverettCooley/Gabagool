Some varieties of cake are widely available in the form of ' cake mixes , wherein some of the ingredients (usually  flour ,  sugar , flavoring,  baking powder , and sometimes some form of  fat ) are premixed, and the cook needs add only a few extra ingredients, usually eggs, water, and sometimes vegetable oil or butter. While the diversity of represented styles is limited, cake mixes do provide an easy and readily available homemade option for cooks who are not accomplished bakers.
