 Total time: 15 minutes plus chilling time 
 Makes about 2 cups 
 Ingredients : 
 8 ounces  smoked salmon 
 1½ cups non-fat  cottage cheese 
 3 tablespoons pepper-flavored  vodka , such as Absolut Peppar  [1] 
 2 tablespoons  lemon juice 
 2 teaspoons  Dijon mustard 
 1 teaspoon prepared  horseradish 
 Directions : 
 Cut half of the salmon into chunks. 
 Dice the remaining salmon. 
 Place cottage cheese in a fine-mesh sieve and press on it to remove excess moisture. 
 Transfer the cottage cheese to a food processor. 
 Add the salmon chunks, vodka, lemon juice, mustard and horseradish. 
 Process until smooth. 
 Transfer the mixture to bowl and fold in the diced salmon. 
 Refrigerate until chilled.  [2] 
 Serve on crostini with freshly cracked pepper. 
 Makes a terrific pasta sauce as well. Add red pepper flakes when tossing with hot pasta. Or serve chilled as a pasta salad, with the addition of minced veggies (great way to empty out the fridge!) 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   
Plain vodka can be substituted for the pepper-flavored vodka, but season generously with cracked pepper. 
 
 ↑   Make ahead tip: Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
