 Description : 
 codfish  fritters
 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â lb  codfish  fillets 
 1/2 cup  beer  (optional), otherwise use  water 
 2/3 cup  wheat flour 
 1 large  egg  at room temperature 
 1  Onion , diced 
 1 teaspoonful chopped  parsley 
 1/2 teaspoonful ground  garlic 
 Directions : 
 Unless you are using fresh, unsalted  codfish , it is advisable to boil the  codfish  fillets in  water , drain and repeat to remove the excess  salt . 
 Shred the fillets into bits with a fork. 
 Blend all ingredients together. 
 Use a deep skillet, half-full of cooking  oil . Preheat the  oil  on medium high heat. Use a ladle to pour the mix slowly into the hot  oil . Alter the amounts of mix as needed to produce the right size for your preference. 
 Remove from the skillet when it appears cooked throughout and the edges begin to curl. Roadside stands hang the fried bacalaitos right over the skillet to let excess  oil  drip back into the skillet. At home you can also lay each fritter on paper towels to remove excess  oil . 
 Eat while still quite warm. Be ready with more mix. They taste delicious and will have your guests asking for second helpings.
