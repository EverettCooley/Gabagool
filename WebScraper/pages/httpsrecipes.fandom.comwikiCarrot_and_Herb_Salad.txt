Errrrrrrrrg 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup fresh Cilantro 
 ¼ cup Rosemary 
 1 cup Sliced Carrots 
 ¼ cup Basil leaves 
 2 cups lettuce 
 
Dressing not included
 
 
 How to make : 
 1st, you chop up about a handful of Cilantro and put it in a ¼ cup measurer and keep on putting some in until the measurer is full. Then, you put it in a salad bowl, but don’t be afraid to put in a little stem, because the stem is yummy, especially in salads. Then, you wash the measurer, fill it with Rosemary, and dump it in. Then you peel and chop up a carrot, put said carrot slices in the bowl, put lettuce into a 1-cup mesurer, dump said lettuce in, and repeat doing so once. To finish it, simply rinse out the ¼ cup measurer, fill it with Basil leaves, and dump the Basil leaves into the salad bowl, and you’re done.
