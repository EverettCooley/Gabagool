Description : 
 
 Buying tomato sauce and roasted peppers at the supermarket makes easy work of these crispy pizzas. Make sure to slice the onion very thin, which allows it to impart its flavor without overwhelming the rest of the toppings. Add a sprinkling of any fresh herbs you have on hand just before serving, if you like, and be sure to break out the red pepper flakes for those who prefer some heat.
