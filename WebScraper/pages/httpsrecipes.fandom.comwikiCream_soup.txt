 Melt  butter , add  flour  and stir it to a smooth paste. Add stock gradually, stirring well. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Then remove from fire. Add some soup to the  egg   yolk  diluted with  cream . Put mixture back into the soup. Stir well. Add some  lemon juice  to taste. Add ground meat balls if desired.
