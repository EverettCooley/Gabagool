 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lbs.  Pork  loin, boned 
 5 cups whole  milk 
 ¼ cup fresh  lemon juice 
 1  Onion , finely chopped 
 1 clove  garlic , chopped 
 3 tablespoons  unsalted butter 
 salt , freshly ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Put the  Pork  into a casserole or ovenproof baking dish that will hold it comfortably and pour over it the  milk  and  lemon juice  mixed together. 
 Cover with a cloth and leave overnight in a cool place. When ready to cook lift the  Pork  out of the  milk  mixture and pat it dry with paper towels. 
 Season with  salt  and  pepper . In a frying pan heat the  butter  and sauté the  Pork  until it is very lightly browned all over. Lift the  Pork  back into the dish with the  milk  mixture. 
 In the  butter  remaining in the pan sauté the  Onion  and  garlic  until the  Onion  is soft. Add the contents of the frying pan to the baking dish, scraping up any pan drippings. 
 Bake the  Pork , uncovered, in a preheated 350 °F oven for about 2 hours or until the  Pork  is tender. 
 Lift the  Pork  out onto a warmed serving platter and remove any string tying it. Cover and keep warm. 
 Skim any fat from the sauce. Over brisk heat reduce it to 1 ½ cups. Stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning and add a little  salt  if necessary. 
 The sauce will be rather grainy in texture. Slice the  Pork  and serve hot with  rice  and a green vegetable. Serve the sauce separately. The  Pork  is also good cold with salad.
