About oxtail : 
 The oxtail was once really from an ox but nowadays the term generally refers to  beef  or  veal  tail. Though it's quite bony, this cut of meat is very flavorful. Because it will be extremely tough (depending on the age of the animal), oxtail requires long, slow braising. It is often used for stews or soups such as the hearty English classic oxtail soup, which includes vegetables, barley, and herbs and it is often flavored with  Sherry  or  Madeira .
