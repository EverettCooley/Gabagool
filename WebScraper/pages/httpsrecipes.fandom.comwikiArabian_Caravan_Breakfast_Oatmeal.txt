 Description : 
 Inspired by the cargoes of caravans that brought goods from the East and East Africa to the Mediterranean and Europe for thousands of years in antiquity, this recipe brings coffee beans and dates to your breakfast oatmeal.
 With the right proportions of ingredients this preparation can deliver an experience somewhat similar to eating a bowl of quality coffee-flavored ice cream, but with negligible fat content while providing a substantial amount of soluble fiber and the other nutritional benefits of oatmeal.
 CAUTION: eating an entire coffee bean delivers more caffeine than the same amount of liquid coffee prepared from that bean, so you may want to drink decaf on the mornings when you eat this. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 one half  (½)  cup  oats  (regular rolled oats,  NOT  quick oats or instant oats) 
 one cup water 
 6-12 "French vanilla" whole coffee beans or other pleasantly flavored coffee beans ( NOT  French  roast  beans, which would be bitter, but French  vanilla ) 
 2 teaspoons sugar (or, if for example using a  stevia  or other  sweetener mixture  that is four times as sweet as sugar, one half  (½)  teaspoon of sweetener) 
 dash of salt 
 several ounces of chopped dried dates 
 Directions : 
 Bring water to boil in saucepan, then turn down to simmer. 
 Add the sugar or sweetener and dash of salt to water, add oats and coffee beans, and simmer for five minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 Add chopped dates, stir, and simmer for an additional minute. 
 Serve and enjoy.
