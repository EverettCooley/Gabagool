 Wikipedia Article  About Wonton noodles on Wikipedia 
Wonton (Chinese: 餛飩 (details)), also written as wantan, wanton and numerous other variations, are a type of dumpling common in Chinese cuisine.
 Wonton wrappers , also known as wonton skins, are made of flour, eggs, and water, and, once filled with meat, can be easily folded and pinched into shape. While assembling the wontons, keep the stack of wrappers moist by covering them with a damp towel. You can seal the dumplings with a "glue" made with cornstarch and water. The wrappers come in different thicknesses. The thin ones work best in soups, while the thicker ones are best for frying. Look for stacks of them wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator cases of Asian markets. Store them in the refrigerator or freezer, but let them come to room temperature before using. 
 Substitutes include  eggroll skins  cut into fourths OR dumpling skins (these have rounded, not square, corners) OR potsticker wrappers (thicker) or  pasta sheet 
 Notes: Wontons are the Chinese answer to ravioli--small packets of meat encased in a thin noodle wrapper.
