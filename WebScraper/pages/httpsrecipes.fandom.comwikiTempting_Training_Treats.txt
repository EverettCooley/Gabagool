 Ingredients : 
 2⅓ cups  flour  ( all-purpose  or  whole wheat ) 
 ¼ cup  olive oil 
 ¼ cup  applesauce 
 ½ cup grated  cheese  (like Parmesan) 
 1 large  egg 
 1 tsp  garlic powder 
 ¼ cup  non-fat powdered milk 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a large bowl; mix well; roll the dough out to size of a cookie sheet; pat the dough onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, bringing it to the edges. 
 Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut desired sizes into dough (just score through). 
 If you're using as training treats, cut them into small pieces; sprinkle a little extra  cheese  and  garlic powder  if desired on dough for flavor. 
 Bake in a 350°F oven about 15 minutes until golden brown. 
 Turn off the oven and let cool for a few hours; they will keep hardening the longer you leave them. 
 Break them apart; store tightly covered or in the freezer.
