 "Wedded Bliss". I don’t know where the name for this yummy cake originates, but I think it’s a good one!
 
 Ingredients : 
 200 ml  oatmeal 
 100 ml  whole wheat flour 
 100 ml  flour 
 100 ml  brown sugar , well packed 
 ¼ tsp  baking soda  (optional) 
 100 g  butter / margarine , semi-soft 
 1  egg 
 as needed  rhubarb  jam  or  stewed  prunes 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. 
 Add the  butter / margarine  and mix well with your hands. 
 Add the  egg  and mix well. 
 Press the dough into a round baking tin, saving some for the topping. 
 Spread with the jam and crumble the rest of the dough over the cake. 
 You can also use the leftover dough to make a pie lattice for the cake. 
 Bake at 200°C for approx 20 minutes. 
 Or until the cake takes on a dark, golden color. 
 Delicious hot or cold.
