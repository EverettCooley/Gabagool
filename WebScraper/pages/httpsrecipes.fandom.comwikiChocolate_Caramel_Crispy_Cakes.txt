Chocolate Caramel Crispy Cakes
 4 (2-ounce) chocolate candy bars (recommended: Mars Bars or Milky Way) 
1/2 stick unsalted butter 
2 1/2 cups crunchy sweetened corn cereal (recommended: Cornflakes) 
 Special equipment: approximately 40 mini muffin papers
 Break the candy bars into bits and drop them into a saucepan. 
 Add the butter and melt, over low heat, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula. When everything is melted (the nougat-like layer takes the longest to go), drop in the cereal, and turn them with your rubber spatula into the chocolate mixture, until they are all pretty well coated. 
 Fill the mini muffin papers with the mixture and put in the refrigerator, on a small sheet pan or tray, for at least 1 hour.
