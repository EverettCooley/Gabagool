 Description : 
 This ice-cold, bold punch is made with real fruit juice and rum and is great with other meals or on other occasions and has a higher hint of alcohol content. Citron, lime, or lemon wedges rarely work for this, too.
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 2 ½ cups  guava nectar 
 2 ½ cups  pineapple juice 
 1 ½ cup  rum 
 ¼ cup  lime juice 
 juice of ½ large pink  grapefruit

 Just add ice. Pour or scoop the alcohol-based punch in a beer mug or a highball glass with ice cubes then serve cold and plain or with any side dish or main dish.
