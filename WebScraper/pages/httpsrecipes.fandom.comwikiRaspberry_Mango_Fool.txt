Description : 
 I needed to make something from South America for my Advanced Pastry Production class, and found a recipe for  mango  Fool. I made it for my class, but later decided to change the recipe a little, and make it raspberry- mango , and add some extra flavoring ingredients.
 
 8 servings 
 8 hours 10 minutes 
 Ingredients : 
 2 ripe  mangoes 
 9 ounces  raspberries 
 3 ounces  powdered sugar 
 2 ounces  lime juice 
 1 ounce  orange juice 
 10 ounces  heavy cream 
 1 ounce  peach schnapps 
 1 ounce  raspberry schnapps 
 Directions : 
 Blend everything except the  heavy cream  and schnapps in a blender or food processor, and chill, covered, in a metal bowl in the refrigerator at least 8 hours. 
 Whip the  heavy cream  and schnapps until it forms stiff peaks, and fold it into the fruit mixture. 
 Serve immediately. 
 Cooking time is chilling time.
