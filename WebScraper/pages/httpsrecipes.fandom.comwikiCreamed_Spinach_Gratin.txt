 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Weir Estate in Canton, Texas in 1990.

 Ingredients : 
 20 oz. frozen chopped  spinach , thawed 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 ½ tablespoon  olive oil 
 1  shallot , diced 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ¾ cup  heavy cream 
 ⅛ teaspoon  nutmeg , freshly ground or grated 
 ½ cup  parmigiano reggiano , freshly grated 
 ½ cup  romano , freshly grated 
 ⅔ cup  fontina , shredded 
 ⅔ cup  panko   or  (1 cup dry breadcrumbs) 
 1 teaspoon  kosher salt 
 1 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Preheat an oven to 450° F. Lightly grease a glass or ceramic loaf pan. 
 Mix together all of the different cheeses then set aside. Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the butter and olive oil. 
 Once the butter has melted and the oils are hot, then add the shallot and garlic to the pan. Sweat the shallot and garlic for 5 minutes. 
 Add the heavy cream and nutmeg to the pan and raise the heat to medium high. Allow the mixture to reduce for 5 minutes. 
 While cream is reducing place thawed spinach into a clean dish towel and ring out as much of the water as you can. Add the spinach, nutmeg and ½ of cheese mixture to the reduced cream. 
 Stir to combine then season with salt and pepper. Pour the creamed spinach into the greased loaf pan. 
 Sprinkle remaining cheese mixture evenly over the top of the spinach, then do the same with the panko. 
 Bake at 450° F for 15 minutes. Serve warm and plain or with other main dishes or vegetables but cut into serving pieces with a chef's knife and place the cooked spinach gratin in a large plate.
