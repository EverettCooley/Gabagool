 ½ lb  Swiss cheese , sliced

 Roll out the sheets of pastry to the size of the baking sheet. 
 Cover bottom with 1 pastry sheet, overlapping the sides a little. 
 Layer salami on pastry and top with cheese slices. 
 Spread with mustard. 
 Cover with second sheet of pastry and seal edges. 
 Just before serving, pierce top layer generously with a fork. 
 Bake in a 400°F oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.

 The pastry can be made ahead of time, covered and refrigerated to bake later. 
 Don't pierce with fork until just before baking.
