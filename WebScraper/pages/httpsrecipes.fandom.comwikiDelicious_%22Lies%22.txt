 In Romanian: Minciuni delicioase
 
 Ingredients : 
 3  yolks 
 1 whole  egg 
 1 teaspoon  confectioner's sugar 
 2 tablespoons  sour cream 
 2 tablespoons plain  seltzer 
 vanilla  or  rum  to flavor 
 flour  as needed 
 salt 
 shortening  for frying 
 vanilla  flavored  confectioner's sugar 
 Directions : 
 Place the sifted  flour  in a pile on the pastry board. 
 Make an indentation in the middle and place the  eggs ,  sugar ,  sour cream , seltzer,  vanilla  and  salt  in it. 
 Knead a rather stiff dough. 
 Divide it into 2 parts and let it rest for 1 hour. 
 Then roll into a very thin sheet. 
 Cut it into 1Â½ inches wide strips. 
 Each strip should be 4 inches long. 
 Cut a notch in the middle of each strip and bring one of the ends through that notch (so that the strips look knotted). 
 Do this for all strips. 
 Fry in a pan with hot  oil  or  lard  or golden brown. 
 Remove with the slotted spoon and sprinkle  vanilla  flavored  confectioner's sugar  over them.
