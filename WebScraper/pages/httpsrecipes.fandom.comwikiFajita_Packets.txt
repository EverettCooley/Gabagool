Ingredients : 
 4 medium bell peppers, in strips (various colors if possible) 
 1 medium small onion, in long strips 
 2 tablespoons oil 
 ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper 
 ¼ teaspoon each, salt and pepper 
 2 cups shredded Mexican-blend cheese 
 Directions : 
 Form six heavy-duty foil cooking packets by removing 24-inch lengths of foil and doubling them over themselves. 
 Use a small amount of the oil to lightly grease the center of each packet. 
 Layer the prepared vegetables in the oiled region. 
 Drizzle remaining oil evenly over the vegetables. 
 Sprinkle spices and cheese over all. 
 Close foil packets tightly by rolling each seam several times but do not close too tightly (leave some room in each packet for expansion caused by steam). 
 Cook packets over indirect heat (grill or campfire) for about 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender-crisp and cheese browns. 
 
Makes six servings.
