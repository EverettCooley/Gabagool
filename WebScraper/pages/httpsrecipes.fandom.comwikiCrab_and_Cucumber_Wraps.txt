 Description : 
 This recipe is a modern twist on the Chinese classic - Peking duck with moo shu pancakes. Crisp, refreshing cucumber and full-bodied dressed crab are delicious with hoisin sauce in warm tortilla shells. You can find hoisin sauce in the aisle of your grocery store where Asian ingredients and other ethnic food are sold. This makes a great al fresco lunch for two but if you want to serve these as appetizers, double or triple the recipe; everything in this recipe multiplies easily.
 
 Ingredients : 
 Â½ of an  English cucumber 
 1 medium dressed  crab  (or if you don't want to cook the crab, look for 1 lb. lump crab meat) 
 4 small whole wheat  tortillas  (but feel free to use regular flour tortillas) 
 8 tbsp  hoisin sauce 
 ground  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Cut the cucumber into small, even-sized batons (julienne cut them). Scoop the dressed crab into a small mixing bowl, add a little freshly ground black pepper and mix lightly to combine. 
 Heat the tortillas gently, one at a time, in a heavy frying pan until they begin to color on each side. If you're brave, you can also cook tortilla shells directly over the flame if you have a gas stove - just make sure to watch them carefully so they do not burn. 
 Spread a tortilla with 2 tbsp. of the hoisin sauce, then sprinkle with a quarter of the cucumber. Arrange a quarter of the seasoned crab meat down the center of each tortilla and roll up. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve immediately.
