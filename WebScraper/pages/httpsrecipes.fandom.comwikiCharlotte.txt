      Strawberry charlotte     
 This classic molded dessert begins with a mold lined with sponge cake, ladyfingers or buttered bread. The traditional  charlotte container  is pail-shaped, but almost any mold is acceptable. The lined mold is then filled with layers (or a mixture) of fruit and custard or whipped cream that has been fortified with gelatin. The dessert is chilled thoroughly and unmolded before serving.
