 Description : 
 Iab is a white curd  Cheese  very much like the Greek  feta . Special herbs are added (and sometimes chopped vegetables) which give it its characteristically acid taste. Since the  Cheese  used in Ethiopia is not available here, this recipe is an attempt to simulate lab.
 
 Ingredients : 
 In a 1-quart bowl:
 
 Combine: 1 Ib. SMALL-CURD  cottage cheese  or  farmer cheese 
 4 Tbs.  yogurt 
 1 Tbs. GRATED  lemon  RIND 
 1 tsp. SALAD HERBS 
 2 Tbs. CHOPPED  parsley 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 1/4 tsp.  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 The mixture should be moist enough to spoon but dry enough to stay firm when served. 
 Drain off excess liquid. 
 One or two heaping tablespoons of lab is placed on the Injera before each guest.
