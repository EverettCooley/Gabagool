Description : 
       Korean-style Salad Dressing     
 Soy sauce,  sesame oil  and  rice vinegar  make the most wonderful  salad dressing  with a distinctly Asian flair. Use on any crunchy oriental salad ( lettuce ,  red cabbage , shredded  carrots ,  bean sprouts ,  radishes , etc.), or any salad period. Particularly tasty on cooked  asparagus  and  spinach  too. It's important to use a mild  vinegar  (such as  rice ).
