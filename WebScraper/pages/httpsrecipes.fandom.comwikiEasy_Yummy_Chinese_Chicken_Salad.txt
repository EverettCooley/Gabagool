Description : 
 For poultry and vegetable lovers! This noodle-based Oriental salad starts off with real chicken, vegetables, and condiments, and is great with other side dishes, main dishes or appetizers but the color and results are worth it. Rice noodles occasionally replace the ramen noodles and work for this, too.

 1 bunch  green onions , chopped 
 12 ounces canned  chicken , drained 
 1 cup toasted and  sliced almonds 
 3 tablespoons chopped, fresh  cilantro 
 Directions : 
 Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, and ramen noodles (or rice noodles) to a pan full of boiling oil.
