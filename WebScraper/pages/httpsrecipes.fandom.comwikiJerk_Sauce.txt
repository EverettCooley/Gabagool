 Description : 
 This red-hot, bold Jamaican barbecue sauce is made, mixed, and packed with authentic herbs, spices, sugar, and scallions, and soy sauce, and is simply great for meat and seafood. Hot sauce and onion powder occasionally work for this, too, as it delivers a great, flaming-hot flavor.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup ground  allspice   or  (⅓ cup Jamaican ground  allspice ) 
 ½ cup  brown sugar 
 6 to 8 cloves  garlic 
 4 to 6  scotch bonnet peppers 
 1 tablespoon ground  thyme   or  (2 tablespoons  thyme  leaves) 
 2 bunches  scallions 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 2 tablespoons  soy sauce , dark or light only, to moisten 
 1 teaspoon hot sauce, optional 
 Directions : 
 Put everything especially including hot sauce in a food processor and blend until smooth. 
 Pour or spoon contents from the spice-based marinade into the fresh container but reserve this in the refrigerator. Use on meat or seafood and for grilling and/or basting.
