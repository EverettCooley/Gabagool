 About Sapodilla : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Sapodilla on Wikipedia 
 Sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) is a long-lived, evergreen tree native to the New World tropics. It is also known as Chickoo (also spelled "Chiku" or "Ciku") in South Asia.
 Sapodilla grows to 30-40 m tall. It is wind-resistant and the bark is rich in a white, gummy latex called chicle. The ornamental leaves are medium green and glossy. They are alternate, elliptic to ovate, 7-15 cm long, with an entire margin. The white flowers are inconspicuous and bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla. The fruit is a large globose berry, 4-8 cm in diameter and containing 2-10 seeds. It has a fuzzy yellow-brown exterior and resembles a round kiwi fruit. Inside, its flesh is an earthy brown color with a grainy texture akin to that of a well-ripened pear. The seeds are black and similar to kiwi seeds.
 The chikoo trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round. The fruit has a high latex content and does not ripen until picked. Some are round and some are oval with pointed ends. It is a native of Mexico and was introduced to the Philippines during the Spanish times.
 Sapodilla was formerly often known by the invalid name Achras sapota. It is known as Chikoo or Sapota in India, Tsiko in the Philippines, Sawu in Indonesia, Chikoo in Malaysia, hồng xiêm (xa pô chê) in Vietnam, Sapodilla or Rata-mi in Sri Lanka, Lamoot in Thailand, Níspero in Venezuela and Naseberry in the West Indies.
