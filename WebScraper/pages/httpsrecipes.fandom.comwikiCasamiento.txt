 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 pound dried  black beans 
 1 medium  Onion 
 2  garlic  cloves (whole) 
 1 cup  chicken broth 
 11/2 cup  white rice 
 salt  and  pepper  (to taste) 
 herbs ( thyme ,  oregano ,  marjoram ,  chives ...) 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Make sure no stone or dirt remain in the beans; rinse them well, and cook them with  water , one or two cloves of  garlic  and half an  Onion . When it boils, decrease the heat and simmer for one and a half hour, checking regularly so that beans always remain covered with  water . 
 Heat the  oil  over medium heat in a large heavy pan. Add the rest of the  Onion  (chopped) and the  rice ; cook until  rice  becomes transparent (2 to 3 minutes). 
 Add 1 cup of  black bean  soup (both beans and liquid), and stir delicately, avoiding to crush the beans. 
 Add the broth, and the bean soup so that the  rice  absorbs the liquid, still stirring from time to time. 
 Repeat the process until  rice  is cooked. 
 Serve immediately, as suggested above.
