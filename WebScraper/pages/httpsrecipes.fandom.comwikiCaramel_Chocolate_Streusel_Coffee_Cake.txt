Description : 
 I got this when I did a search for diabetic  chocolate  caramel streusel cake. Please tell me if I'm wrong.
 This sweet  coffee  cake is filled with mini  chocolate chips  and drizzled with melted caramel. It's great for breakfast or dessert. I made this to get rid of a craving for sweets this morning. I'm not sure of the exchanges, but I did the best I could to use light or unsweetened everything I could. It was still good.
