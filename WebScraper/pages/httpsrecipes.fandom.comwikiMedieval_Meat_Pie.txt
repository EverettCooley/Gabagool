 Description : 
 My version of the Basic meat Pie is from www.godecookery.com. I have successfully made this three times. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ lbs  beef  (any or all of  beef ,  pork ,  rabbit   venison , etc. — just 1½ lbs total. However,  sirloin steak  turns out the best). 
 1 cup grated  cheese 
 ½ cup  currants  or  raisins  (or any other dried fruit) 
 4  egg yolks 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cardamom 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon  nutmeg 
 ½ teaspoon  bell peppers 
 ½ – 1 cup broth (whatever most of the meat is) 
 1 dash cooking  wine 
 1 x 9-inch pie shell (with lid) 
 Directions : 
 Broil the meat until very rare, but cooked through. 
 Cut it into small cubes. 
 Mix with all other ingredients except the pie shell. 
 For the broth, just add enough to make the mixture a little wetter. 
 Put the mixture into the pie shell. 
 Be sure the shell lid is sealed, and punch some holes in the top with a knife. 
 Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes to an hour, till the shell is golden brown. 
 Makes 6 – 8 slices, and can be served any temperature. 
 Notes : 
 It is easiest to cut when cold.
