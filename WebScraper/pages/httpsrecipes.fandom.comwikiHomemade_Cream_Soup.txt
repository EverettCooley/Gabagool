Description : 
 To use in place of canned cream soups in casseroles or as a base for your own soups. Much lower in fat and  salt  than the canned versions. The trick is to have it made up ready to use! 
 
 Makes 9 servings with less than 1 gram fat per serving. 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cup  powdered non-fat milk 
 ¾ cup  cornstarch 
 ¼ cup (or less) instant  chicken  (or  vegetable  if you prefer) boullion 
 2 tbsp dried  onion flakes 
 1 tbsp  basil  leaves 
 1 tbsp  thyme  leaves 
 ½ tbsp  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients, mixing well. 
 Store in an airtight container until ready to use. 
 Use : 
 To substitute for one can of condensed soup: combine ⅓ cup of dry mix with 1¼ cups of cold  water  in saucepan. 
 Cook and stir until thickened. 
 Add to casserole as you would the canned product. 
 I think you could probably vary the spices to suit your own taste or the type of casserole you were making.
