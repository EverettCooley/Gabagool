 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1/4 cup  vegetable oil 
 2 pounds boneless  Pork  loin, cut into 2-inch cubes 
 1 cup finely chopped  onions 
 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots, or substitute  green onions  (white part only) 
 1 cup strained fresh  orange juice 
 1/4 cup strained fresh  lime juice 
 1/4 cup  water 
 1/4 teaspoon crumbled dried  thyme 
 1/2 teaspoon  salt 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1/2 small  hot pepper , minced 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a large, heavy skillet, heat the  vegetable oil  over medium until a light haze forms above it. 
 Add the  Pork  cubes. 
 Turn frequently with a spoon and adjust the heat as necessary so the cubes brown richly and evenly without burning. 
 Stir in the  onions , shallots,  orange juice ,  lime juice ,  water ,  thyme ,  salt ,  pepper  and  hot pepper . 
 Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover the skillet, lower the heat and simmer 30 minutes. 
 Uncover the skillet, increase the heat to high and, stirring frequently to prevent the meat from sticking, cook briskly 10 minutes or until the sauce thickens to a syrupy glaze.
