       Lumpia Shanghai     
 Ingredients : 
 2 pound  ground beef 
 1 large  onion , finely chopped 
 1 can mixed vegetables 
 ¼ cup  soy sauce 
 2½ tbls Tony's creole seasoning 
 1½ tablespoons  garlic powder 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 1 (16 ounce) package  spring roll wrappers 
 1½ quarts  oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 In a large bowl, combine ground  beef ,  onion , and vegetables 
 Make sure to completely mix everything 
 Get down and dirty and use your hands 
 Knead the meat in the bowl if you must 
 Gradually blend in the soy sauce , Tony's,  garlic powder , and  salt  until all ingredients are evenly distributed 
 Lay out a few wrappers at a time on a flat surface, and place about 2 tablespoons of the filling in a line down the center of the wrapper 
 Make sure the filling is no thicker than your thumb, or the wrapper will cook faster than the meat 
 Take the bottom and top edges of the wrapper and fold them towards the center 
 Take the left and right sides, and fold them towards the center 
 Moisten the last edge of the wrapper to seal 
 Now repeat using the rest of the wrappers 
 Heat the  oil  in a deep-fryer or heavy skillet to 375 °F (190 °C) 
 Fry 3 or 4 lumpia at a time 
 Fry for about 3 or 4 minutes, turning once 
 Lumpia are cooked through when they float, and the wrapper is golden brown 
 Cut in half, or serve as is with dipping sauce of your choice 
 We like sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce with  calamansi , or  banana  ketchup
