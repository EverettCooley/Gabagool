 About brown rice : 
 Brown rice is the unmilled or partly milled rice, a kind of whole grain. It has a mild nutty flavor, is chewier than white rice, and becomes rancid more quickly. Any rice, including sticky rice, long-grain rice, or short-grain rice, may be eaten as brown rice.In much of Asia, brown rice is associated with poverty and wartime shortages, and in the past was rarely eaten except by the sick, the elderly and as a cure for constipation. This traditionally looked-down-upon kind of rice is now more expensive than common white rice, partly due to its low consumption, difficulty of storage and transport, and higher nutritional value. Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat and protein. The difference between the two lies in processing and nutritional constitute. A large variety of vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. Several of these missing nutrients, such as B1, B3, and iron are then added back into the white rice making it enriched. One mineral that is not added back into white rice is magnesium; one cup of cooked long grain brown rice contains 84 mg of magnesium.
 Brown rice is a variety from which only the outer husk is removed during milling, leaving a nutritious, fiber-rich coating of bran that gives the kernels their chewy texture and nutlike flavor. Short, medium, or long-grain brown rice is available.
