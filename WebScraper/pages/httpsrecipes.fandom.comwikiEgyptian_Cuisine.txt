 Egypt - Cooking and Food : 
 Overview of Egyptian Cuisine History : 
 dikEgyptian food reflects the country's melting-pot history; native cooks using local ingredients have modified Greek, Turkish, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian traditions to suit Egyptian budgets, customs, and tastes. The dishes are simple; made with naturally ripened fruits and vegetables and seasoned with fresh spices.
The ancient Egyptian's diet consisted of a vast amount of grains, fish, vegetables, and fruits.  grain  offered an endless supply of food to the ancient Egyptians and could be stored with little spoiling. Fruits and vegetables were also a major part of the Egyptian's diet.  Fish, just like  grain , was a part of most Egyptian's daily diet. Eating fish was shunned by some of the upper class Egyptians, but it was popular with the masses.  Meat (from land herds) was eaten by the common people only on special occasions because of the high price and scarceness of cattle.  Honey was a great addition to the Egyptians diet, used for many different applications. It was commonly used as a substitute for  Sugar .
