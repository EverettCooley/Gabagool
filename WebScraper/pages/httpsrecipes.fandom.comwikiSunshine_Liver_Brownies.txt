 Description : 
 Freeze Leftovers for a rainy day!
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 to 3 1/2Â lbs of liver,  Beef  or  Chicken 
 1 C  whole wheat flour 
 4.25 oz jar fresh minced or crushed  garlic 
 2 C white  flour 
 1/2 C  corn  meal 
 1 med shaker of grated  Parmesan cheese 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cover cookie sheet with foil, coat with  cooking spray , sprinkle lightly with  corn  meal and set aside. Process liver and  garlic  in food processor or blender until it looks like  milk chocolate . Pour into large mixing bowl and blend in the rest of the ingredients. Spread evenly onto cookie sheet (the mixture will be thick) and sprinkle lightly with  corn  meal. Bake until no pink is left. I usually bake them for about 30 minutes for one pan and then turn the oven off but leave the brownies inside until they are cool. Cut in pieces and be ready to be loved by your dog(s). I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't like SLBs and I think that this is about the greatest bait on earth... Enjoy!!!
