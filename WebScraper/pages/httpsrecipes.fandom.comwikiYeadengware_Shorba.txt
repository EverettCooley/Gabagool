Description : 
 Ethiopian Kidney Bean Soup
 
 Ingredients : 
 1Â½ cup  kidney beans  soaked in 
 4 cup  water  overnight (or two 15-oz cans  kidney beans  drained and rinsed) 
 6 cup  water 
 1 small  leek  chopped 
 1 small  carrot  peeled, chopped 
 3 cup  vegetable  or  beef stock 
 salt  to taste 
 1 small  potato  peeled, chopped 
 2 tbsp  pastina  - (small  soup pasta ) (or you can break up soup noodles) 
 Directions : 
 Put soaked  kidney beans  in a large saucepan with 6 cups of  water , bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for an hour or so, until they are done. 
 If you are using canned  kidney beans , you can skip the step of simmering the  beans  for an hour. 
 Add the  leek ,  carrots , stock, and  salt  and cook for about 10 minutes. 
 Add the  potatoes  and pastina, bring quickly to a boil, then reduce heat and cook for 15 more minutes. 
 Serve hot with  injera , if you can find it - or with pita bread. 
 Serve hot to 4 as a first course or, with traditional injera bread torn into it, as a light meal. 
 Comments : 
 This soup is so simple and pure that it just seems right for a land as ancient as Ethiopia - reputedly founded by the son of king Solomon and the queen of Sheba, ruled by the fabulous Prester John, and abandoned by Samuel Johnson's Rasselas, the Prince of Ethiopia.
