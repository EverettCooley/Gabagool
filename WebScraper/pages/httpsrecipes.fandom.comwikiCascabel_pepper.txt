 Wikipedia Article  About Cascabel pepper on Wikipedia 
 The cascabel is a small, round, hot chilli that is prized for the hot, burning sensation that it produces in the mouth when consumed. It is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum. The Spanish translation of cascabel means "rattle" or "little round bell". Appropriately these rich, nutty flavored chilies' seeds make a rattling noise when shaken. This medium heat chile is commonly used in sauces and soups.
 The pepper, when dried makes a rattling noise and as such can be used to make music.
 The plant can grow to more than 1 meter and grows in the wild on the Pacific coast of Mexico.
