 Description : 
 
 A Mexican-fast-food-inspired tortilla dish using what I have access to in local general-purpose grocery stores in New England circa 2015.
 
 Ingredients : 
 one flour tortilla 
 refried beans, preferably a brand with a smooth consistency containing no whole beans 
 shredded "Mexican" cheese mixture 
 chopped Poblano pepper 
 chopped small tomato 
 chopped ½ ripe avocado 
 salt 
 chili powder 
 lime juice 
 sour cream 
 Directions : 
 Rinse a baking sheet with clean water, leaving damp, and spray lightly with oil 
 Using a spatula or large knife coat one side of the tortilla with a thin, even coating of refried beans 
 Place tortilla on the damp, oiled baking sheet 
 Sprinkle shredded cheese thickly over tortilla; the refried bean and cheese should cover the tortilla completely so that none of it is exposed 
 Bake tortilla under a broiler for 3-4 minutes or in a preheated 365° oven for 10 minutes; the cheese should thoroughly melt and barely start browning and the tortilla should become hydrated and elastic 
 Mix together chopped vegetables, season with salt, chili powder, and lime juice, and toss in a small bowl 
 Pile vegetable mix on tortilla, add a line of sour cream, and roll up for easy handling
