Weights and measurement  conversions are always a dangerous part of using a recipe your unfamiliar with. I know I've ruined more than one dish that way! The following charts should be handy as a quick little reference.
 
 A note on accuracy 
 These charts are accurate enough for cooking, but would likely yield disappointing results for anything requiring scientific precision. Most of the imperial to metric conversions required rounding. Also, each region tends to have their own variations depending on cultural differences. For instance, a teaspoon in the UK is about 20% larger than teaspoons in the US.
