 Description : 
 Purchased from Bowers Estate in Fort Worth, Texas in 1994. Dated 1962. I made this for a  spaghetti  supper I hosted a few years ago. It’s good, but I won’t make it again. I have many more recipes that are much more acceptable.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium loaf unsliced  French bread 
 1/2 cup softened  butter 
 2 cloves  garlic , halved 
 1 teaspoon dried  parsley 
 1/3 cup grated  Parmesan cheese 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Combine  butter ,  garlic ,  parsley  and  Parmesan cheese . 
 Soften at room temperature before using. 
 Preheat oven to 375. 
 Cut slices down the length of the bread loaf at 1 inch intervals, without cutting all the way through. 
 Rub slices and top of loaf with spread. 
 Wrap bread in foil, leaving top partially uncovered. 
 Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.
