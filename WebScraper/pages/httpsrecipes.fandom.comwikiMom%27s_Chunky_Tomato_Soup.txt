 Ingredients : 
 1 can (14.5 ounces) stewed  tomatoes  undrained 
 1 can (10.75 ounces)  cream of celery  soup 
 1 can (10.75 ounces)  tomato purée 
 1 soup can of whole or  skim milk 
 1 tablespoon  butter 
 2 slices of mild  cheddar  cheese, or ⅓ cup pre-shredded  cheddar  cheese 
 2 slices of whole-wheat or white  bread 
 Directions : 
 Place the stewed  tomatoes  with their liquid and the  celery  soup,  tomato  puree and  milk  in a 2 quart saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring just to combine. 
 Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer, uncovered, until the flavors blend, 4 to 5 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, make the grilled cheese cubes. 
 Place half of the  butter  in a small nonstick skillet over medium high heat. 
 Place the  cheddar  cheese between the  bread  slices and , if necessary, trim  cheese  slices to fit the  bread . 
 Place the sandwich in the skillet and dot the top with the remaining  butter . 
 Cook the sandwich until the bottom is golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip it with a spatula. 
 Cook the second side until the  cheese  is melted and the  bread  is crusty and golden brown 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
 Remove the sandwich from the skillet with a spatula and use a sharp knife to cut it into 30 small crouton-like pieces. 
 To serve, ladle the soup into serving bowls, and scatter 5 grilled  cheese  cubes on top of each serving.
