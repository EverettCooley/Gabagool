Ingredients : 
 
 chocolate  cake mix  + ingredients on cake mix box 
 2 cans of  chocolate  frosting 
 red M&Ms 
 black  jelly beans 
 red  gumdrops 
 candy corn 
 Directions : 
 Make cupcakes according to the recipe on the box. Cool completely. 
 Place a large scoop of frosting on each cupcake. 
 Spread a layer of frosting over each cupcake, but leave a big dollop in the center. 
 Working from the outside in, stick the prongs of a fork into the top layer of frosting and gently pull it out to create a furlike texture. Repeat until the frosting is textured and evenly distributed. 
 Use M&M's for eyes, a jelly bean for the nose, a flattened gumdrop for the tongue, and the white part of candy corn for fangs. 
 For a pointy nose, place a gumdrop under the icing in the center and half a jelly bean flat on top.
