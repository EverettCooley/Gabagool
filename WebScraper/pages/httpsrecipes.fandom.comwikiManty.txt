 Description : 
 Uzbek Lamb Dumplings
 
 Ingredients : 
 Filling : 
 1½ pounds of lean  lamb , finely ground 
 1½ cups of finely chopped  onions 
 2 teaspoons of  salt 
 ½ teaspoon of freshly ground  black pepper 
 6 tablespoons of  butter 
 Dough : 
 1½ cups of  flour 
 1½ cups of  water 
 ¼ cup of finely cut fresh  dill leaves  or fresh  mint 
 ¼ cup of unflavored  yogurt 
 
 
 Directions : 
 For the filling, mix the ground  lamb , chopped  onions ,  salt  and  pepper  in a mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until well combined. 
 Pour the  flour  into a large mixing bowl, make a deep well in the center and pour in the  water . 
 Mix vigorously until smooth, then gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. 
 Roll out into a rectangle about 1/16 inch thick. 
 With a 4½ inch cookie cutter, cut out 18 to 20 circles of dough and spoon about 5 teaspoons of filling in the center of each. 
 Top each circle with 1 teaspoon or  butter  and draw up the sides of the circles so that they meet in the middle, enclosing the filling. 
 Dip your fingers in  water , pinch the top closed and twist it to form a small pouch. 
 Steam the manty in the following fashion: pour enough  water  into a large kettle to come about 1 inch up the side. 
 Bring to a boil over moderate heat and set a colander into the kettle. 
 Place the manty in the colander, cover the kettle securely and lower the heat. 
 Steam for 15 minutes, then transfer the manty to individual bowls or to a large serving bowl. 
 Sprinkle with the dill or  mint  and serve with  yogurt , either as an accompaniment to the soup of alone as a light luncheon dish.
