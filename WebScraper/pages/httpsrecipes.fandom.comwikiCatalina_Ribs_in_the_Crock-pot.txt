 Description : 
 Purchased from the Colvin Estate in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1989. Notation on card indicates this is a weekly meal in the Colvin House. Dated 1982. I have made these 4 or 5 times and they are awesome. Easy and very tasty. I have also made them with French dressing (not as good) and Russian dressing (every bit as good).

 2 pounds boneless  Pork  ribs 
 1 white  Onion , chopped 
 2 clove  garlic , minced 
 8-oUnce bottle of Catalina dressing
