About chocolate milk : 
 Chocolate milk  is a sweetened,  cocoa -flavored  milk  drink. It can be purchased pre-mixed or made at home with either cocoa powder and a sweetener (such as real sugar or an artificial brand, such as Splenda), or with melted chocolate, chocolate syrup, or chocolate milk mix. Other ingredients, such as starch, salt, carrageenan, vanilla, or artificial flavoring may be added. Chocolate milk should be refrigerated normally like plain milk. A solution is required to blend in the two flavors (milk and chocolate, hence the name of the mixed drink).       Chocolate Milk
