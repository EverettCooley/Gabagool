 Ingredients : 
 1 cup dried small  bow-tie pasta 
 2 1/4 cups  vegetable broth 
 1 tsp.  coarse salt 
 1/2 tsp. freshly ground  pepper 
 1 cup uncooked  kasha 
 1/2 cup chopped fresh  parsley 
 1 Tbs.  olive oil 
 2 medium  onions , halved and thinly sliced 
 2 large cloves  garlic , minced 
 12 oz. fresh  Mushrooms , such as stemmed shiitake, cremini or button, thinly sliced 
 2 to 3 tsp. chopped fresh  oregano 
 2 tsp. chopped fresh  thyme 
 Juice of 1 large  lemon 
 Directions : 
 Bring large pot of lightly salted  water  to a boil. Add  Pasta ; stir to prevent sticking. Cook  Pasta  until just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
 
 While  Pasta  is cooking, in small saucepan, bring 2 cups broth, 1/2 teaspoon  salt  and 1/4 teaspoon  pepper  to a boil over high heat. Add  kasha , cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer cooked  kasha  to bowl and fluff with fork. Gently mix in  parsley  and cooked  bow ties . Set aside.
 
 While  kasha  is cooking, heat  oil  in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add  onions  and cook, stirring often, until softened, 7 to 8 minutes. Add  garlic  and cook, stirring, 30 seconds (reduce heat, if necessary, so  garlic  doesnâ€™t burn). Stir in  Mushrooms , remaining 1/2 teaspoon  salt  and 1/4 teaspoon  pepper . Mix well and reduce heat to medium.
 
 Stir in  oregano ,  thyme  and  lemon juice  and cook, stirring often, until  Mushrooms  release their liquid and soften, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup broth and heat through, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes.
 
 Spoon  Mushroom  mixture on top of  kasha  mixture and serve hot.
