 Description : 
 Similar to egg-nog, but without the alcohol. The original recipe includes  Raisins /or  prunes , which I prefer to leave out. 
 
       Eggjamj√≥lk - Egg soup     
 Ingredients : 
 1250 g  milk 
 2 tblsp 
 1-2 ea  eggs 
 1-2 tblsp. 
 to taste  vanilla  flavouring 
 Directions : 
 Break the  egg (s) into a bowl or soup tureen and whip with the  Sugar  until light and frothy. Mix together the  flour  and 200 ml cold  milk . Bring the rest of the  milk  to the boil. When the  milk  boils, remove from the heat and pour slowly into the  egg / Sugar  mixture, stirring constantly. Add  vanilla  flavouring to taste. Sprinkle  Sugar  on top to prevent a skin from forming. Serve immediately.
Variations:-Original recipe: Soak 2 tblsp  Raisins  or 10  prunes  in a little hot  water  for 5 minutes. When the  milk  is hot, but not boiling, add the  Raisins  (pour off the  water  first). When the  milk  boils, add the  flour / milk  mixture and cook on low for 10 minutes. Finish the recipe as above. This is the original recipe, but since I don't like cooked  Raisins , I leave them out.-To be used with either of the above variations: Use two  eggs . Separate the yolks and whites. Mix the yolks with  Sugar , and whip the whites until stiff. When the soup is ready, float spoonfuls of  egg  whites on top of it. If you have ovenproof soup dishes, put the soup in a hot oven with top heat and remove when the  egg  whites begin to turn yellow. -Use twice as much  flour  to make a pudding. Serve warm with  milk / cream  and  Sugar .
