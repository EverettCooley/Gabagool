I found this recipe in Consumer Reports last year. It's really good. One of the readers uses all dark molasses, more cayenne, orange zest instead of marmalade, and no liquid smoke for his. I've tried it both ways and changed it to suit my taste at the time of making it. Yields about 2 cups of sauce and takes about 30 minutes to prepare.
