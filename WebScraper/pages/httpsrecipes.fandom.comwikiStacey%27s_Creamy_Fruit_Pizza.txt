 Ingredients : 
 2 (8 ounce) cans Pillsbury Original Refrigerated Crescent Dinner Rolls 
 1 (3½ ounce) box sugar-free instant  vanilla  pudding mix 
 16 ounces light  sour cream 
 sliced  strawberries  (or sliced  peaches ,  kiwi  slices,  mandarin orange  slices, chunked  pineapple ,  grapes ,  blueberries , etc) 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375°F. 
 Spray a large round pizza pan with nonstick  cooking spray , or line it with parchment paper. 
 Unroll the crescent dough and arrange the triangles in a circle with points toward the center, adjusting or adding dough as needed, to line the bottom of the pan. 
 Be sure to press together seams and perforations. 
 Bake for 14–17 minutes, or until golden and lightly browned, (completely done but not hard or burnt). 
 Make sure it’s not under-baked or it will become soggy later. 
 Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely (if using parchment paper, grasp the edges of the paper to lift the crust out of the pan, then remove it to allow the crust to cool). 
 When thoroughly cooled, transfer to serving platter, or place back into pizza pan. 
 Mix together pudding powder and  sour cream  with electric mixer until thoroughly combined. 
 Spread onto cooled crust.
