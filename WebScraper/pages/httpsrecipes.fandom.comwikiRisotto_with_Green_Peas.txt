 Ingredients : 
 2 tsp.  olive oil 
 1 1/2 cups finely chopped  leeks  or  onions 
 1 1/2 cups uncooked Arborio  rice 
 1/2 cup dry  white wine ,  dry vermouth , or dry  sherry 
 4 cups  vegetable broth 
 1 tsp.  salt  or to taste 
 10-oz. pkg. frozen small  green peas  (rinse away any  ice  crystals) 
 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more to pass at the table 
 2 tsp. good quality  balsamic vinegar , plus more to taste (optional) 
 Freshly ground  black pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Heat  oil  in pressure cooker over medium-high. When it begins to foam, add  leeks  and cook 1 minute, stirring frequently. Stir in  rice  and coat  grains  with  oil . Add wine and cook over high heat, stirring, until it evaporates, about 1 minute. Add broth and  salt .
 
 Lock lid in place. Over high heat bring to high pressure. Lower heat to maintain high pressure and cook 5 minutes. Quick-release pressure. Remove lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.
 
 Boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until  rice  is tender but still chewy, and risotto becomes creamy and thick, 5 to 6 minutes. During the final minute, stir in the  Peas  and Parmesan. Add  balsamic vinegar , if desired, to bring up flavors. Let sit 5 minutes to absorb excess liquid.
 
 Spoon risotto into large shallow bowls and sprinkle with a few  twists  of  black pepper . Pass extra Parmesan at the table.
