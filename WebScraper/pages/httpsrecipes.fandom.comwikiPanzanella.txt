About panzanella : 
 An Italian bread salad made with onions, tomatoes, basil, olive oil, vinegar, seasonings, and chunks of bread. Some versions also include cucumbers, anchovies and/or peppers. More traditional recipes call for soaking the bread in water and then squeezing the water out. Others suggest browning the bread in olive oil before adding it to the salad.
