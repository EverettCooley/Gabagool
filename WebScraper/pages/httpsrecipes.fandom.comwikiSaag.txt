      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 Tonight - being a Saturday night - Ms.79 and I decided to cook a simple but delicious dinner for ourselves: simply  saag . A simple, uncomplicated, wholesome and very fulfilling Punjabi dish that we try to make a tradition of cooking every Saturday morning - to eat on Saturday night. Wonderfully simple - very nutritious and extremely delicious! And here follows the recipe:
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 2 mediium-size finely chopped  onions 
 3 tsp.  turmeric 
 3 tsp.  garam masala 
 2 tsp. ground  coriander 
 2 tsp.  salt 
 chili pepper 
 minced  garlic 
 piece of  ginger 
 2 heaping tsp.  cornmeal 
 300 g  spinach 
 500 g spring  greens 
 Directions : 
       Chopped-up greens and spicach leaves cooking for about 60 mins     
           
         Zap in short bursts     
         If you zap in long bursts it will male a load of mess in the kitchen     
         Two heaped spoons of polenta     
         Stir in the polenta mixture until cooked     
         Cutting off a knob     
         Stiring the butter in until it melts     
         Simmer for another half-hour and give it a stir every few mins     
         it's been going for 1.5 hours now and should be at the thinkness that you prefer     
         Finely chopped onions frying until goldeny-brown     
         Add the pre-pulped garlic,ginger and chiliw and stir fry for a few mins     
         Adding the spices     
         Cooking out the onion/spice mixture     
         Adding the "tarka" mixture to the saag     
         Stiring it in thoroughly - no heat     
         Ok - It's done now     
         Serve with warm roti and a side salad and a glass of red     
 Wash all the leaves in your kitchen sink - and then chop them up in batches into coarse ribbons on a chopping board. 
 Dump the chopped-up leaves into a large-ish pan one-third full of boiling  water  on the stove. 
 Boil the leaves for about 45 minutes on a semi-agressive simmer 
 After about 45 mins of semi-agressive simmering - use a magi-mix blender to “zap” the mixture in 5 or six very-short bursts in order to break-down the coarse, stewing ribbons of leaf into more finely shredded bits: 
 After another 20 minutes of simmering - give the mixture a good stir - 
 Put two heaped dessert-spoons of maize- flour  (polenta/ cornmeal ) into a glass and then add some  water  from the tap. Give it a good stir - ensuring that there are no lumps - and then add to the simmering saag mixture. 
 Let it simmer for a few minutes - and then chop a generous knob of  butter  and add to the pot - stirring until melted. 
 You will especially enjoy the fact that at this point - the saag is not simmering as such - instead large bubbles start to form just below the surface of the mixture - and erupt like mini-volcanoes - making a gloopy sound - and splattering your kitchen in a 2 metre radius around the pot. So make sure that you keep a lid handy - just haf-covering the pot so that some of the  water  evaporates and thickens the mixture. 
 Simmer like this gently for another half-hour - stirring occasionally - and then turn off the heat after it has reached your desired consistency. 
 Then get another small pot - put in a little  oil  - heat up and then add  onions . Fry until the  onions  are slightly golden-brown. 
 Then add the  ginger ,  garlic  and chillie. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the smell of it all spreads across the kitchen. 
 Then add the spices to the browned  onions : 2 teaspoons  salt , 3 teaspoons  turmeric , 3 teaspons  garam masala , two teaspoons ground coriander. By now - the special aroma will be wafting its way out of your kitchen and into your garden - and from there - onwards into the kitchens of your next door neighbours. They will be envious. 
 Then add the onion-spice mixture to the saag pot - and stir until well mixed: 
 Then - when you are ready to eat - heat-up the completed saag until it’s just about to boil - serve into a bowl and accompany with either fresh roti - or naan bread (or pitta bread) and a fresh salad of chopped  cucumber , halves of  cherry tomato , chunky strips of  carrot , halves of small  radish , and chunkily-chopped red- Onion  - all tossed in a few dashes of tangy  vinegar . Simply delicious! 
 If there’s any saag remaining in the pot - just put it away into a microwaveable container with a lid - and store in your fridge. It will keep for around 2 days. Just take out of fridge at any time and put container in microwave for a few minutes of reheat - stirring and reheating until piping hot. You can even store in freezer - and will keep for weeks like that. Just make sure you defrost for a few hours before attempting to reheat in microwave. 
 Variations 
 You could also try making “aloo saag” or “paneer saag” with the leftovers: in either case you simply get some cubes of  Potato  or paneer and fry them until golden brown - perhaps adding some more  masala  spice and  salt  to the frying cubes - and then stir them into the saag and serve piping hot.
