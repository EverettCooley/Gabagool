 About baobab fruit : 
 Baobab fruit is the fruit, which is naturally dried on the baobab tree. The pulp contains very high amounts of vitamin C, and contains significant amounts of calcium, as well as other vitamins and minerals. In addition, baobab is loaded with natural dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble. This makes it a healthy whole fruit supplement, as well as helps to add texture to smoothies and other food mixes.
 Baobab is a fruit from Africa. Baobab trees produce a fruit with a hard shell like a coconut. Just about every part of the tree is used: the fruit, juice, leaves, and seeds.
