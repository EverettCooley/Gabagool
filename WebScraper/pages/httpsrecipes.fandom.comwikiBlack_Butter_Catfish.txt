Description : 
 A  Catfish  recipe featuring black butter, pecans, and almonds.
 
 Ingredients : 
 6 U.S. farm-raised  catfish  fillets 
 ½ cup  butter 
 2 tablespoons  white vinegar 
 2 tablespoons chopped  pecans  or  sliced almonds 
 Directions : 
 Poach the  catfish  fillets for 6 to 8 minutes in barely simmering  water  to which you have added a touch of  white wine  and 2  lemon  slices. 
 Lift the fillets carefully onto a plate to drain. 
 The fillets will hold at this point, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. 
 Black butter : 
 Place the  butter  in a heavy skillet and heat until it begins to color slightly. 
 At this point, add the  pecans  or  almonds  and carefully stir to spread evenly over the skillet. 
 Continue to stir, while the  butter  deepens to a rich, nutty brown and the  nuts  color. 
 When the  butter  has almost burned, slowly add the  vinegar  and step back. 
 The steam and sizzle can scald. 
 Take the skillet off the heat, stirring to let the foam subside. 
 Set aside until needed. 
 To serve : 
 Place poached fillets in individual serving dishes or a baking dish to hold them in one layer. 
 Cover the fillets with the black  butter , being sure to place the  nuts  on top of the fish. 
 Heat for 10 to 15 minutes in a 350°F oven or until the  butter  sizzles in the dish. 
 Serve with a wedge of  lemon .
