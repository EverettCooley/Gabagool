 Description : 
 This homestyle Chinese dish is spicy, savory and easy to prepare. It's the ultimate comfort food and a childhood favorite for those of us who grew up in Chinese households. Feel free to make it your own by adding vegetables or other ingredients. My grandmother, for example, used to add peas and tomatoes.

 2 tbsp  oil , for sautéing 
 1 tbsp  black bean   garlic  sauce (see  notes ) 
 1 tsp red  chile paste with garlic 
 ¼ lbs  ground pork 
 1 pack fresh  tofu  (any firmness), cubed 
 ¼ cup chopped  green onions 
 salt , to taste

 In a wok or deep skillet, place  oil ,  black bean  sauce, red  chili sauce  with  garlic  and ground  Pork .

 Cook's notes : 
 Black bean   garlic  sauce and red  chile paste  with  garlic  are available at Asian markets and some supermarkets with large Asian specialty sections. Chile bean paste can be substituted for the black bean garlic sauce and red chile paste.
