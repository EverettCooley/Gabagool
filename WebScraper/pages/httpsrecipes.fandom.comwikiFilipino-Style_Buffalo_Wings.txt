 Description : 
 Buffalo wings are an American chicken recipe and the reason why they are called buffalo wings is because they were created in Buffalo, New York. A great combination of real poultry, herbs, and spices is made with hot sauce and ketchup and fried to flaming-hot perfection.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 kilo chicken wings 
 1 tsp. spice rub 
 1 tsp. onion powder 
 1 tsp. garlic powder 
 ¼ cup margarine  or  (1 cup butter) 
 ¼ cup hot sauce 
 ½ cup banana ketchup 
 ½ cup cooking oil 
 ½ tsp. salt 
 ½ tsp. pepper, black or red only 
 5 tbsp.  calamansi  juice, reserving 2 tablespoons for the sauce 
 cornstarch, for coating the chicken 
 chopped parsley, for garnishing 
 Directions : 
 Wash the chicken wings. Drain any excess water from the washed chicken, then coat them with  calamansi  juice, salt, spice rub, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper. 
 Marinate for at least 1 hour for the best result. 
 In a deep-frying pan, heat some cooking oil, just enough to cover the chicken wings while deep frying. 
 Coat the chicken wings with cornstarch before frying. You can use a strong plastic bag then shake and coat the chicken with cornstarch. Then deep-fry the chicken wings until golden brown. 
 Drain the excess oil in a strainer or with a paper towel. 
 In a saucepan, melt the margarine or butter and add with the hot sauce, the remaining  calamansi  juice, and banana ketchup. Mix very well and simmer for a few seconds. 
 Add to the fried chicken wings and stir-fry until each has been well coated with the sauce. Serve hot and plain but garnish with the chopped parsley.
