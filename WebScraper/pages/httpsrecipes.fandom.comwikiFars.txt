 Shape the meat into balls sized to suit what you are using them for. 
 For mock turtle soup, you will want small balls and you will want to boil them for a few minutes or you can make patties and fry them. 
 For appetizers, make small balls and fry them, serve with a dip in any case cook until done it is always a good idea to just cook one meat ball to check the consistency, seasoning etc. 
 Adjust if necessary. The important thing is to beat the meat mixture and beat it again.
