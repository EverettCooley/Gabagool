 Ingredients : 
 1 (16-oz.) jar  salsa , mild, medium, or hot 
 1 medium  onion , diced 
 1 (11-oz) can  corn , drained 
 ½ cup  black olives , cut in half (I use a whole can) 
 1 lb lean  hamburger  or  ground turkey , cooked and drained 
 6 large flour or corn  tortillas  (I like the flour tortillas) 
 1 or 2 cans  refried beans 
 1½ cups  Monterey jack  or  cheddar  cheese 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F with the rack in the middle position. 
 Spray a 2½ quart ovenproof dish with non-stick  cooking spray . 
 Place the salsa in a strainer and press out as much liquid as possible (you can use this liquid to zip up spaghetti]] sauce). 
 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the salsa,  onion ,  corn , olives, and hamburger or  turkey . 
 Spread each tortilla with  refried beans  and place two tortillas in the dish with the bean side facing up. 
 Cover with ⅓ of the salsa mixture and ⅓ of the  cheese . 
 Place two more tortillas on top and repeat with a layer of salsa mixture and  cheese . 
 Top with remaining two tortillas and remaining salsa mixture and  cheese . 
 Bake 45 minutes or until the  cheese  is bubbling and a knife inserted in the center comes out hot. 
 To freeze: freeze torta unbaked. 
 To serve, remove from freezer and let sit 1 hour. 
 Bake at 350°F for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until bubbly and hot.
