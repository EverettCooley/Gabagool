Chocolate Malted Cookies
 2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter flavored vegetable shortening (like
Crisco)
1 1/4 cups brown sugar-firmly packed
1/2 cup malted milk powder (like Ovaltine)
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 cup (4 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup (4 oz.) milk chocolate chips
 Preheat oven to 350-degrees.
 Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt; set
aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, brown
sugar, malted milk powder, chocolate syrup and
vanilla. Using an electric mixer, beat 2 minutes, then
add the egg and beat for a second or two, until mixed.
Gradually add the flour mixture to the creamed
mixture, mixing well between additions. Stir in
chocolate chips.
 Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls of dough
onto cookie sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake
for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Don't over-bake
them or they'll be hard as a rock.
 Yield: about 40 cookies
