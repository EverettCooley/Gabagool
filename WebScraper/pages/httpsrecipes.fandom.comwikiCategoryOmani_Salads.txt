 Most of the Omani salads are made from fresh vegetables like tomatoes, carrots, onions, parsley, peppers, green beans, potatoes, or from fish like tuna and sardines. Moreover, in spite of its general aridity, Omani land provides good conditions allowing grapes apricots or coconut palms to grow. Therefore, adding sugar, ice cream or any interesting ingredient which you consider to be the most appropriate for a fruit salad, would transform the kitchen into a real sweet heaven.
