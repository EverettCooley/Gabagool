Contributed by  World Recipes Y-Group 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  granulated sugar 
 1 cup  butter  flavored  Crisco   or  2 sticks (¼ lb) 
 ⅔ cup  milk 
 1 tablespoon  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 Mix  sugar  and Crisco together. 
 Heat  milk  until hot on finger (do not boil) 
 Add half of the  milk  to  sugar  - Crisco mixture and beat 2 minutes. 
 Add rest of milk and beat 8 minutes longer (a total of 10 minutes all together). 
 The beating breaks up the  sugar  granules to a  whipped cream  consistency, but is a  butter  type. 
 To make a  whipped cream  frosting, use white Crisco instead of  butter -flavored (I use these often as I don't always have  confectioners' sugar  on hand) 
 Enjoy.
