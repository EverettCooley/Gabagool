Description : 
 The  garlic  doesn't really give these a pronounced  garlic  flavor — it just eliminates some of the cloying sweetness of the  pumpkin . When these first come out of the oven they are very crisp on the outside and dense and moist on the inside—sort of like little mini-spoonbreads. After they cook the texture becomes more uniform and more like the standard biscuit we all know and love.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup canned  pumpkin  (not pie filling) 
 ⅔ cup  skim milk  or other form of liquid 
 1½ cup  flour  (half white, half whole-wheat) 
 2 tbsp  wheat germ 
 2 tbsp  wheat bran 
 4 tbsp  baking powder 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 1 pinch  nutmeg 
 1 tbsp  salt  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Combine wet, combine dry, mix wet into dry, drop by generous spoonfuls onto baking sheet squirted with PAM. 
 Bake 20 – 30 minutes at 450°F.
