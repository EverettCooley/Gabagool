       Baby Lamb Chops     
 Ingredients : 
 12 x New Zealand baby single-rib  Lamb  chops wholly frenched to the eye - (abt 2 lbs) 
 1 x  garlic  clove halved crosswise 
 1/2 tsp crumbled dried  thyme 
 Freshly-ground  white pepper  to taste 
 DIPPING SAUCE 
 
 1/3 cup white- wine vinegar 
 1/4 cup  Sugar 
 1/4 cup minced fresh  mint  leaves plus 
 1 tsp minced fresh  mint  leaves 
 salt  to taste 
 Freshly-ground  black pepper  to taste 
 
 
 Directions : 
 In a small saucepan combine the  vinegar  and the  Sugar  and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the  Sugar  is dissolved. Stir in the  mint  and let the sauce cool. Season the sauce with  salt  and  pepper  and transfer it to a small bowl.
Pat the chops dry, rub them with the cut sides of the  garlic , and sprinkle both sides of the chops with the  thyme  and the  white pepper . Grill the chops in a well-oiled ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, on each side for rare meat. (Alternately, the chops may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for about 2 minutes on each side for rare meat.) Serve the chops with the dipping sauce.
