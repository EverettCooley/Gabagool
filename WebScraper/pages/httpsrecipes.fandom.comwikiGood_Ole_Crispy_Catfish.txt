 Ingredients : 
 4  Catfish  fillets, (about 6 to 8 ounces each) 
 1/3 cup  cornmeal 
 1/3 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1/2 teaspoon  paprika 
 1/4 teaspoon  Onion  powder 
 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 1  egg , lightly beaten 
 1 tablespoon  water 
 1/2 cup CRISCO  oil 
 tartar sauce, (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Rinse fish. Pat dry. Combine  cornmeal ,  flour ,  salt ,  paprika ,  Onion  powder and  pepper  on sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper. 
 Combine  egg  and  water  in shallow dish or pie plate. Dip fish in  egg  mixture. 
 Coat with  cornmeal  mixture. 
 Heat Crisco  oil  to 365 °F in electric skillet or on medium-high heat in large heavy skillet. Fry fish for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until crisp and browned. Drain on paper towels. Serve with tartar sauce, if desired.
