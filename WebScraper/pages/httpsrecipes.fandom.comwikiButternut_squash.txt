 Wikipedia Article  About Butternut squash on Wikipedia 
 Butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata), also known in Australia and New Zealand as Butternut pumpkin, is a type of winter squash. It has a sweet, nutty taste that is similar to pumpkin. It has yellow skin and orange fleshy pulp. When ripe, it turns increasingly deep orange, and becomes sweeter and richer. It grows on a vine. The most popular variety, the Waltham Butternut, originated in Stow, Massachusetts, on what is now the Butternut Farm Golf Club.
 Butternut squash is a fruit that can be roasted and toasted and also be pur√©ed (to make a soup) or mashed into soups, casseroles, breads, and muffins.
 In Australia, it is regarded as a pumpkin, and used interchangeably with other types of pumpkin.
 A common fruit in South Africa, it is used in soups and will be cooked on a grill wrapped in foil with spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon.
 It is a good source of fibre, vitamin C, manganese, magnesium, and potassium. It is also an excellent source of vitamin A.
