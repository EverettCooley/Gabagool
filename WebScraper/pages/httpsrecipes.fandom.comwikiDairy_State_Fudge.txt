Dairy State Fudge
From Country
 I grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, so it's only natural I have a
lot of recipes that use dairy ingredients. Our farm also had a lot of
hickory trees, so we always made this fudge with hickory nuts. I make
this candy nearly every Christmas. You'll find it's hard to eat just one
piece.
 INGREDIENTS
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
 2 tablespoons butter (no substitutes)
 2 pounds white almond bark, broken into small pieces
 1 to 1-1/2 cups chopped pecans, walnuts or hickory nuts
