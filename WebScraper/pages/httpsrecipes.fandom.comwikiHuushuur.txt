 Ingredients : 
 For the filling:
 
 1 kg minced mutton or  Beef , with fat included 
 3 ½ teaspoons  salt 
 1  Onion , chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 water  to mix 
 Mix the filling ingredients together into a firm paste.
 For the dough:
 
 4 ½ cups  flour 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 water  to mix 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dough ingredients together and knead into a dough. Divide into smaller pieces and roll these into cylinders about 3 cm in diameter. Cut the cylinders into 4 cm lengths.
To assemble:
Take one length of dough and  Squash  it into a circle. Roll it out until it is 8 to 10 cm wide. Roll more at the edges than in the middle, so the dough is slightly thinner around the edges. Put 2 ½ dessertspoons of meat mixture onto one side of your circle, leaving a space around the edge. Fold the other side over, pinching the edge flat. Leave one corner open and squeeze out the air, then seal the corner. Fold the corner over and pinch again, then work around the edge folding and pinching into a twist pattern. Repeat the process with the rest of the filling and dough pieces.
To cook:
Using 2 litres cooking  oil , heat the  oil  in a wok (make sure the  oil  comes no higher than 5 cm below the top). Fry three or four pasties at a time for two minutes each side, until they are brown and the meat is cooked. Eat with  tomato  ketchup or soy sauce.
