      limoni cotti al forno     
 Prep Time: 10 minutes 
 Cook time: 10-15 minutes 
 Serves: 4 
 
 Description : 
 Lemons cooked in the oven. Not only is this antipasta super simple, it is great for a party - a 2-bite taste explosion! Even if you think you don't like anchovies - give it a go! Plus the bubbly mozzarella in the bright yellow lemon 'cup' make for a dramatic presentation.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 large unwaxed  lemons 
 1 or 2 x 5-oz. balls of buffalo  mozzarella , sliced into ¼ inch thick pieces 
 4 fresh  basil  leaves 
 2  anchovy  fillets 
 2 ripe  cherry tomatoes , halved 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Preheat your oven to 400 °F. 
 Remove the ends of the lemons & discard them (don’t cut in to deep - you want to keep a closed bottom). Then cut the lemons in half crossways, giving you little lemon bowls 
 Using a small knife, remove the lemon flesh, leaving you with 4 hollow lemon rind bowls. (Again you don’t want to break-into the rind) 
 Cut a piece of mozzarella to fit inside, then lay a basil leaf, half an anchovy fillet and half a cherry tomato on top with a pinch of salt & pepper. 
 Put another slice of mozzarella on top - the lemon should now be filled up. Do the same to the rest of the lemon bowls. 
 Place on a baking sheet & cook in a preheated oven for 10 - 15 minutes, until golden & bubbling. 
 Remove from the oven & allow to cool for a few minutes 
 Serve with crostini. Scoop the mozzarella out & eat with the toast to mop up any juices!
