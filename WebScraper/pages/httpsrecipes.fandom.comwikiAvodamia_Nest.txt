 Description : 
 You can use your own imagination for fillings and toppings for this basic idea
 
 Ingredients : 
 2  California avocados 
 2 beaten  eggs 
 ground raw  macadamia nuts  to coat  oil  for frying 
 Fillings 
 8 large  Mushrooms 
 1 medium  Onion  finely sliced 
 finely sliced  sour cream  to garnish or 
 1 ½ Cups grated  Cheese 
 4 slices  Ham , finely chopped 
 2 sticks  celery , finely chopped or 
 2  tomatoes , diced, or  cherry tomatoes 
 4  Shallots , finely chopped 
 1 ½ tsp dried  basil 
 1 clove  garlic , crushed 
 125g  cream cheese , finely diced 
 Directions : 
 Cut  avocados  in half, remove seeds and carefully peel away skin. 
 Dip  avocado  into beaten  egg , then into ground  macadamia nuts . 
 Rather than move the  avocado  half around too much, it is easier to toss the  nuts  over it with a spoon. 
 Fry in shallow  oil  on both sides until golden brown. 
 Saute  onions  and  Mushrooms  in a little  butter  until soft but not mushy. 
 Place in 'avodamia' nest and garnish with a swirl of  sour cream  and a sprinkling of  paprika . 
 Toss  Cheese ,  Ham  and  celery  together and pile into avodamia nest. 
 Grill under moderate heat until  Cheese  is bubbling and  browning  slightly. 
 Mix all ingredients together and pile into avodamia nest. 
 Bake in a very hot oven until filling is heated through. 
 Note: If the last filling is used, don't brown the avodamia nest quite as much to allow for  browning  in the oven.
