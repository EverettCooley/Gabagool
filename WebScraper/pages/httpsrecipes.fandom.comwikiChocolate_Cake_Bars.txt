 Ingredients : 
 1 Tbs.  distilled white vinegar 
 3/4 cup lightly packed  brown sugar 
 1/4 cup (1/2 stick)  unsalted butter , melted and cooled slightly 
 1 tsp.  vanilla extract 
 1/2 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup Dutch-process  cocoa powder 
 1 tsp.  baking powder 
 1/4 tsp.  baking soda 
 chocolate  Ganache for frosting (optional) 
 1 cup pureed  silken tofu 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 F. Coat 8-inch square baking pan with  cooking spray . (Do not use glass baking pan or bars will get too dark and dry.) 
 
 In medium bowl, whisk together  tofu  and  vinegar . Whisk in  brown sugar ,  butter  and  vanilla  until blended.
 
 In large bowl, mix together  flour ,  cocoa ,  baking powder  and  baking soda . Whisk in  tofu  mixture until just blended. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan.
 
 Bake until cake pulls away from sides of pan and feels almost firm in center, about 25 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool until cake is firm enough to cut, about 30 minutes.
 
 While in pan, cut into bars and serve. Or, to frost, invert cake onto a plate or cutting board. Spread ganache on warm cake and let stand until ganache is firm enough to cut without smearing, about 1 hour.
