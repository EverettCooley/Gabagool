Ingredients : 
 2 cups of full cream  powdered milk 
 1 tablespoon of  baking powder 
 2  eggs , beaten 
 about 6 tablespoons of  vegetable oil 
 1 cup of  sugar 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cardamom 
 saffron  thread or powder 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  powdered milk  with  baking powder . 
 Then add the  eggs  and 4 tablespoons of  oil . 
 Mix well and form into ½ inch balls, by rolling in your hands. 
 If the mix becomes too dry to roll, add a little more beaten  egg . 
 In a pan combine the  sugar  with 1½ cups of  water , the  cardamom , and the  saffron . 
 Boil for 3 – 4 minutes. 
 Remove from heat and allow to cool until warm (but no longer hot). 
 In a frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of  oil  over medium-low heat. 
 Add half of the balls. 
 Cook until the balls are a light brown on all sides. 
 Do this by constantly tilted and turning the pan, so the balls continually roll around from one side to another. 
 Place the balls in the warm syrup. 
 Allow to remain in the syrup for about five minutes or until you have finished frying the second half of the balls. 
 Remove from the syrup and drain on kleenex tissue or kitchen paper. 
 Cover with another piece of tissue or kitchen paper and allow to sit for at least three hours before serving. 
 Enjoy! it is hard to keep your hands off these ones!.
