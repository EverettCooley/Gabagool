 Directions : 
 In a large mixing bowl combine ground  Beef  with tenderizer,  lemon juice ,  egg ,  onions ,  salt , choice of  pepper ,  garlic , and  nutmeg . Cover and let stand for 30 minutes to set and permit seasonings to mingle. Form about a dozen tablespoon-size balls of the seasoned  Beef . Spread  flour  on a plate and roll each ball in  flour  to coat.
 Meanwhile, heat  oil  in a large skillet over medium heat. When  oil  is ready a toothpick or bread crumb dropped into the skillet will quickly sizzle and begin to brown. Brown all sides of meatballs evenly while using a metal spoon for turning. When meat is finished  browning , remove from the skillet with a slotted metal spoon. Place on paper towel to remove excess  oil  and reserve both meatballs and cooking  oil .
 To prepare gravy return remaining cooking  oil  to a large, clean skillet and brown all remaining  flour . Add  onions ,  tomato  sauce, sliced  tomato , and  green pepper . Cook for 10-minutes over medium heat. Slowly stir in  water  and thoroughly combine sauce mixture. Add reserved browned meat balls, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Continue to simmer for approximately 30-minutes, stirring occasionally until gravy is well blended throughout the meatball mixture. Serve hot over  rice . Stew goes well with  sweet potatoes ,  yams  or  pineapple  slices.
