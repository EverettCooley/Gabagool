Ingredients : 
 oil  to fry meat ( palm oil  is most authentic,  peanut oil  or  vegetable oil  will do) 
 one pound  Beef  stew meat 
 one cup  Peanut butter , or  peanuts 
 lots of greens:  cassava  leaves,  kale ,  collard greens ,  turnip greens , or similar; stems removed and cleaned 
 African Hot Sauce, or  cayenne pepper  or red pepper (to taste) 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 If you are using  peanuts  (instead of  Peanut butter ), make your own homemade  Peanut  paste: 
 Remove the  peanuts ' shells, roast the  peanuts  on a baking sheet in a hot oven, or in a large skillet on the stove, stirring often, then remove the skins. 
 Place the  peanuts  in a saucepan, add enough  water  to partially cover them and bring to a slow boil, stirring often. 
 Reduce heat. 
 Crush  peanuts  with a potato-masher. 
 Bring greens to boil. 
 In a separate stew pot, saut√© meat in  oil , reduce heat. 
 Add the greens to the meat and simmer for an hour. 
 When the greens are nearly fully cooked, pour out most of the  water . 
 Add the  Peanut butter  (or  Peanut  paste) and spices. 
 Simmer on very low heat.
