 About Irish whiskey : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Irish whiskey on Wikipedia 
 Irish whiskey is a grain whiskey made in Ireland. There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland. Single Malt (A whiskey made from 100% malted Barley); Pure Pot Still (A whiskey made from a mixture of Malted & unmalted Barley), and Blended Whiskey (A whiskey made from a blend of Malted Barley and non-malted grains such as corn or wheat).
 Note the difference in how the Irish spell "whiskey" (with an "e") and how the Scottish spell it - "whisky". There is no known reason, legal or otherwise why this difference exists.
 
Peat is almost never used in the malting process, resulting in a whiskey with an arguably smoother, sweeter flavour. In most Irish whiskey, the smoky, earthy overtones of Scotch are absent.       Irish Whiskey
