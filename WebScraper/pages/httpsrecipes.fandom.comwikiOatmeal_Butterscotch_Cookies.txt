Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookies
 1 cup margarine
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups flour
1 1/4 cups oatmeal
1 (12 ounce) package butterscotch chips
 Cream margarine, brown sugar, and sugar. 
 Add eggs and vanilla, and beat well. 
 Combine salt, baking soda, flour, and oatmeal. Stir into creamed mixture. 
 Stir in butterscotch chips.
 Drop onto a cookie sheet. (This creates a very soft dough, and must be dropped not rolled, these are best when baked right away).
 Bake at 350, for 11 minutes.
