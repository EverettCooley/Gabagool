Ingredients : 
 Spices 
 Directions : 
 Place spices in a heavy nonstick skillet or wok. 
 Roast while stirring vigorously over medium/high heat. They will start to brown in about 30 sec.- 1 min. 
 Reduce heat when this starts to happen. Continue to roast on low heat until they turn medium to dark brown. 
 Remove from heat, transfer to another container and set aside to cool. 
 Notes : 
 Dry-roasted spices are best if used right away, but can be kept for about 1 week in airtight container. 
 Dry-roasting is an age-old cooking process that imparts extra flavor to the foods.
