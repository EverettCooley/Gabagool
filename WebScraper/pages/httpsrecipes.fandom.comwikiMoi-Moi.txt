 Directions : 
 Clean the black-eyed  Peas  in  water  in a large pot. Cover them with boiling  water  and soak them overnight. After soaking them, rub them together between your hands to remove the skins. Rinse to wash away the skins and any other debris. Drain them in a colander. 
 Crush, grind, or mash the black-eyed  Peas  into a thick paste. Slowly add enough  water  to form a smooth, thick paste. Beat with a wire whisk or wooden spoon for a few minutes. A tablespoon of  oil  may be added. In a separate container combine all other ingredients and crush and stir them together until they are thoroughly mixed. Add the other ingredients to the  Black-eyed pea  paste and stir to make a smooth mixture.
 Grease the muffin pans (or tin cans). Scoop the Moi-Moi mixture into the pans, allowing some room for it to rise while cooking. Place the pans in a baking dish partially filled with  water . Bake in a medium-hot oven for about a half-hour. Moi-Moi in tin cans can also be steamed in a large covered pot on a stove. Check for doneness with a toothpick or sharp knife. Serve hot or at room temperature.
