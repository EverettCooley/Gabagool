 Ingredients : 
 Caramel : 
 ¼ cup  sugar 
 ¼ cup hot  water 
 Custard : 
 1 cup fresh or canned  coconut milk 
 1 cup  milk 
 ¼ cup  sugar 
 4  eggs 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 
 Caramel : 
 Cook the  sugar  in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, without the water, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. 
 Stir the hot  water  into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble vigorously). 
 Boil the mixture, swirling the pan occasionally, until the  sugar  is thoroughly dissolved, about 2 minutes. 
 Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce ramekins. 
 Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel. 
 Custard : 
 Combine the  coconut milk ,  milk  and  sugar  in a medium saucepan over low heat. 
 Scald until the  sugar  dissolves completely. 
 Remove from heat. 
 In a large bowl, whisk the  eggs  and  vanilla . 
 Gradually whisk the hot  coconut milk  mixture into the  eggs , blending thoroughly. 
 Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. 
 Carefully pour into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins. 
 Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see note). 
 Put the soufflé dish or ramekins in the roasting pan and add hot  water  to reach halfway up the side of the dish. 
 Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. 
 Be careful not to let the  water  boil; do not disturb the custard while baking. 
 This is the only "secret" to producing a smooth and velvety custard. 
 Remove the souffle dish or ramekins immediately from the hot  water . 
 Allow to cool in a cold- water  bath. 
 Chill thoroughly. 
 To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto dessert plates. 
 Serve with shaved  ice  or  whipped cream , if desired.
