Description : 
 "There are thousands of great, elaborate recipes for Alberta  Beef ," said John Korobanik, food editor of the Edmonton Journal. "But often the tastiest result comes from keeping it simple." 
 He recommended we picnic on his mother-in-law's recipe, "deliciously simple but well worth the lack of effort. It takes the best of Alberta  Beef  and turns it into a mouth-watering reward." 
 With the "reward," as John put it, be sure to serve horseradish, to add to slices of the meat on a  bun  or on a plate with other foods. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup (175 mL)  soy sauce 
 ¾ cup (175 mL)  red wine 
 ¾ cup (175 mL)  oil 
 2 tablespoons (25 mL) grated  fresh ginger   or  crushed  garlic 
 2½ to 3 pounds (1.2 to 1.5 kilograms)  flank steak 
 Directions : 
 Combine soya sauce, wine,  oil  and  ginger  or  garlic  in a shallow bowl. 
 Score meat with shallow cuts, criss-cross-style at 2-inch (5 cm) intervals and add to marinade, turning to coat meat. 
 Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours but preferably overnight, turning occasionally. 
 Remove meat from bowl, reserving marinade. 
 Barbecue over medium-hot coals or at medium-high setting, brushing occasionally with marinade, 4 to 6 minutes per side, or until cooked to desired doneness. 
 Remove from barbecue and let stand for 5 minutes, then cut diagonally across the grain, in extra-thin slices. 
 Wrap well and chill.
