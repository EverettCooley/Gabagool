 Wikipedia Article  About Turbinado sugar on Wikipedia 
 Turbinado sugar, sold by the brand Sugar in the Raw among others, is a type of sugar cane extract. The name arises from the fact that it is often created in a process that involves being spun in a cylinder or turbine while being sprayed.
 White sugar is the result of removing the molasses from Turbinado sugar, and brown sugar is the result of adding molasses to white sugar. Sometimes brown sugar is the mixture of white sugar and caramelized white sugar. This mixture does not have any of the original molasses, just burnt white sugar for the brownish color. Turbinado sugar is similar in appearance to brown sugar but paler, and in general the two can be exchanged freely in recipes.
 Related types of raw sugar include  Muscovado  and  Demerara  (sugar).
