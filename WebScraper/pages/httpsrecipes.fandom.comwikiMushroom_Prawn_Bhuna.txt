       Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 The term "bhuna" is used to describe a method of cooking spices "dry" - which means only in  oil  - and no other moisture. So, effectively it's about cooking with very little  water . For those of you who follow these recipes - you will notice that tinned  tomatoes  (chopped) is used quite frequently as the base to the "sauce" used to cook many dishes. In a bhuna you don't create a sauce as such - but you might garnish the end-dish with finely chopped  tomatoes  to add some moisture.
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Small packet of  button mushrooms 
 Small packet of already-cooked and peeled  tiger prawns  - 200g packet 
 Two large  onions  (you need a lot of  onion  for a bhuna) 
 2 large, ripe  tomatoes  (for the garnish at the end) 
 The usual chunks of  garlic ,  ginger  and  chile  from your freezer (thawed by 30 second zap in the microwave) 
 Plenty of chopped fresh (or frozen)  coriander 
 1.5 teaspoons of  turmeric 
 2 heaped teaspoons of  garam masala 
 2 heaped teaspoons of  ground coriander  (dhaniya) 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cumin  powder 
 A generous squirt of concentrated  tomato purée  from those toothpaste-style tubes they come in (sorry it's not in the picture) 
 Directions : 
 Now heat on medium flame a couple of tablespoons of your favourite  vegetable oil  in a medium sized pot or pan.
 First of all - chop the  onions  - and just as a reminder to those who are new to Indian-style cooking - the traditional way to chop  onion  (or indeed any vegetable or fruit) is to first chop the peeled  onion  in half - and then gripping the half- onion  in the palm of one hand - (arm stretched out over a pot with some hot  oil  in it) and a sharp knife in your other hand - you place the edge of the knife on the furthest-awayflat edge of the half- onion  in your hand - and you draw the knife towards you as one thin slice of half- onion  cuts off and drops into the pot and starts sizzling straight away. You keep doing this manouvre until there is no  onion  left in your hand. You have to see this technique in action to believe it - it's quite amazing and looks really dangerous - but it's how generations of Indians have been taught to chop vegetables - straight into the pot. None of this messing about with chopping boards, worktops and careful slicing with the knife!
 Anyway - each of the half- onion  slices will break up into thin slivers (the layers of the  onion  coming apart) in the pot as they are cooked until browned. Stir occasionally to ensure that the  onions  don't burn. when the  onions  have browned - then add the pulped  garlic ,  ginger  and chillie. be careful about the amount of chillie you use in this dish - because we are only using 200g of tiger prawns (shrimps) and a small packet of  mushrooms  - this is really only enough for two people - so don't overdo it with the chillie unless you want it to turn out really fiery and hot - which is actually how i like this dish anyway.
 Stir the pulped  garlic ,  ginger  chillie with the  onions  - stirring more frequently to ensure that they get a thorough cooking - for around 5 mins.
 
       Fry the chopped onion until golden brown     
         Stir in the pulped garlic, ginger, cillie. Fry for a few mins more     
 Whilst the pot is cooking - chop the button  mushrooms  in half - and also deseed the ripe tomoatoes and chop them finely. Stick the chopped tomato in the fridge - as this will be used for the garnish at the end - perfect "cool" accompaniment to a fiery hot and dry dish.
 Then add the ground/dried spices as per the measurements in the list above. Stir it all around - and you will notice that the pot is now very dry. Keep stirring so that the powdered spices don't stick to the base of the pan - turn the heat down a little too. The idea is to let the spices roast for a while - say a few minutes.
 
         Chop the mushrooms and tomatoes     
         Add the ground spices     
 To give yourself a little relief at this point - squeeze some of the tomato purée concentrate from the tube into the pot as well. Make sure the purée is stirred around thoroughly too. This is to slightly moisten the dry mixture - and also add a really small amount of  water  as well if it really is very dry. The  tomato purée  also adds some deep red colour to the mixture in the pot.
 
         Dry for around 5 mins     
         Stir in the mushrooms     
 After a couple of mins pour the half- mushrooms  into the pot and stir thoroughly. Turn up the flame a bit - and stick the lid on the pot. The  mushrooms  will soften in the steam - and will release more moisture - which will soften them even more. When they are soft - the dish is practically done. So you might want to switch off the flame and cover the pan completely at this point if you are not ready to serve yet. e.g. you might be preparing dinner for later or making some  rice  etc. It's important NOT to put the prawns (shrimps) in until the very last minute - as cooked prawns are already cooked (duh) and will only get hard and chewy if cooked even more.
 
 
         Add a little water - and let it simmer     
         When mushrooms soft add cooked prawns and stir     
 When you're ready - just warm up the  mushroom / onion  mixture in the pan and stir in the cooked prawns (shrimps) until they are heated. Serve up on a bed of  basmati rice  - and garnish with  coriander leaf  and top with the finely chopped  tomato . Enjoy!
 
 Recipe by Route 79 : 
 From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.
