Grilled Flank Steak or London Broil (like the picture on the home 
page)
 
 2 to 2� pounds flank or top round steak 
� cup dry red wine (preferably the wine you plan to serve with the 
 
 meal) 
 
 a few drops of bottled hot sauce 
2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped fine 
2 tablespoons fresh, chopped parsley 
2 tablespoons fresh marjoram, thyme, and/or rosemary 
in whatever combination suits your palate 
� cup olive oil 
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
 

 
 Place the meat in a nonreactive container or a 1 gallon zip-lock bag. 
In a small bowl, add the wine, the hot sauce, the garlic, and the 
herbs. Mix well, then whisk in the oil. Add salt and freshly ground 
black pepper to taste. Pour the marinade over the meat, covering it 
well, cover the container or close the bag, and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, take the meat out of the marinade while you build a 
charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium hot. Place the 
marinade in a stockpot and simmer for ten minutes. Grill the meat 
over a medium fire about 5 minutes per side, basting with the 
marinade. Let the meat rest for 5 minutes after it is cooked, then 
cut in thin slices across the grain on a bias.
 Yields about 8 servings.
