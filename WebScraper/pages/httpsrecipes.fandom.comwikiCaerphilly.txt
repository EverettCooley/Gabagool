 Wikipedia Article  About Caerphilly on Wikipedia 
 Caerphilly cheese is a hard cheese that originates in the area around the town of Caerphilly in Wales. It was not originally made in the town, but was sold at market there, hence taking the town's name.
 It is a light-coloured (almost white) crumbly cheese made from cows' milk, and generally has a fat content of around 48%.
 This mild yet tangy cow's milk cheese has a moist, semifirm texture and is generally sold in cylinders or blocks. It's best eaten frest ( the English prefer it only a few weeks old) and is delicious with dark breads and ale. Though now produced in England, Caerphilly gets its name from the village in Wales where it was first made; it was the traditional lunch of Welsh miners.
