 About Milk : 
 Milk most often means the nutrient fluid produced by the mammary glands of female mammals to feed their young, including humans. The female's ability to produce milk is one of the defining characteristics of mammals and provides the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to digest more diverse foods. Milk, usually non-human milk is processed into dairy products for human consumption, such as cream, butter, yogurt, ice-cream, gelato, cheese, whey protein, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additive and industrial products. Milk usually contains sugar, nutrients, and proteins such as lactose, galactose, casein, calcium, and others.
