 Description : 
 This recipe came from an estate sale. I obtained it when I purchased the family collection from the Roark Estate in Grand Prairie, Texas in 1984. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can buttermilk biscuits 
 5 slices bacon cooked and quartered 
 10 whole mushrooms

 Heat oven to 450 then grease cookie sheets. 
 Press or roll each biscuit into a 3 inch circle. 
 Place 1 piece bacon on each biscuit then top with 1 mushroom and 1 additional bacon piece. 
 Wrap each biscuit around mushrooms and bacon to enclose and pinch edges to seal. 
 Place seam side down, on greased cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes.
