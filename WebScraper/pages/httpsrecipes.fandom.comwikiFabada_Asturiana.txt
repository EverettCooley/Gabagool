Description : 
       Fabada Asturiana     
 Fabada is known as “Asturian stew” and is heavy, full of calories and delicious. 
 
 Serves 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 2½ lbs dry (not canned)  butter beans 
 4 medium sized “ chorizos ” (Spanish  pork sausages  available at gourmet shops, delis and some supermarkets) 
 4 smoked “ morcilla ” blood sausages 
 1 lb  shoulder of pork 
 6 slices of  Serrano ham  on the bone 
 1  onion , finely chopped 
 5 cloves  garlic 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  beans  overnight in cold  water  (important they are soaked at least 10 hours). 
 When  beans  are ready, soak the meats in warm  water . 
 In a separate large pot, add the  beans   garlic  and  onion  and add  water  to cover the ingredients. 
 Bring to a boil, then throw away the top layer that rises to the surface. 
 Add all the other ingredients, and  water  to cover, place on very low heat, and slow cook for 2½ - 3 hours. 
 While cooking, gently shake the pot by the handles (never stirring, which breaks the  beans ) about every 20 minutes. 
 Add  water  throughout the cooking time s necessary, making sure the liquid always covers the ingredients. 
 When cooked fully, add  salt  to taste and let cool for 10 minutes. 
 Take out the meats and cut into small pieces, serving the meat separately from the stew.
