 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  sugar 
 1 tablespoon  dry yeast 
 1½ cup lukewarm  water 
 8 cups  flour 
 1¼ cup  sugar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 4 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 1½ cups lukewarm  water 
 2  eggs , well beaten 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 1  egg , well beaten, for glaze 
 2 tablespoons  poppy  or  sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 Make a sponge by mixing the tablespoon of  sugar  and  yeast  in the half-cup of warm  water . 
 Let stand in a warm place for about ten minutes, or until foamy. 
 Sift the dry ingredients together - the remaining  flour ,  sugar , and  salt . 
 Mix the four tablespoons of  oil , the remaining  water , and the two  eggs  in a small bowl and add them to the  flour  mixture. 
 Mix well. 
 Then add the  yeast  sponge and mix well. 
 Knead until satiny smooth. 
 Use the remaining  oil  to rub the bowl and put the dough in it. 
 Turn it over to  oil  the top and cover it with a damp cloth. 
 Put the bowl in a warm place for one hour, or until dough is doubled in bulk. 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Punch down the dough and re-form into a ball. 
 Divide it into two equal pieces and knead each lightly. 
 Divide each half into three pieces and form each into a rope about three-fourths of an inch in diameter. 
 Pinch one end of three ropes, braid, then pinch the other end. 
 Tuck both ends under the loaf. 
 Repeat with the other three ropes. 
 Put the braided loaves on a greased cookie sheet and let them rise ten minutes. 
 Paint each loaf with beaten  egg  and sprinkle with seeds. 
 Bake for about 55 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom with a spoon.
