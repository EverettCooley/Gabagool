 Break the bread in cubes on top of that. 
 In a large bowl whisk the  eggs ,  milks ,  sugar ,  vanilla . 
 Pour over the bread. 
 Add a few  raisins  if you like. 
 Cut the stick of  margarine  into pieces and place all over the top of pudding. 
 Bake in the preheated 350°F oven for 40 to 45 minutes. 
 While baking, I melt another stick of  margarine  in a heavy saucepan, add ½ cup  flour  and make a paste, add 1 cup  evaporated milk  and ½ cup  water  and bring to a boil, whisking as you go. 
 As it thickens add 1 tsp  vanilla  and ¼ tsp  salt . 
 Continue to cook lowering heat and whisking until it is "very" smooth. 
 Serve over each bowl of bread pudding.
