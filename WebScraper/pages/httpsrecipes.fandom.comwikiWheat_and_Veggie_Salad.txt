Description : 
 For dressing I use fat-free  yogurt  with  balsamic vinegar  and some  sugar .  Yogurt  or  sour cream  with dried  Italian salad dressing  would also be good.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cup  cracked wheat  or  wheat berries 
 2 cup chopped  tomatoes 
 1 cup chopped  cucumbers 
 1 chopped  purple onion 
 fat-free  yogurt 
 balsamic vinegar 
 sugar 
 Directions : 
 Start with 2 cups of cooked  cracked wheat . 
 I just boil it until its done. 
 Actually I think you are supposed to use boiled  wheat berries . 
 Add an equal amount of chopped  tomatoes  and half as much chopped  cucumbers  and chopped purple  onion  to taste.
