Description : 
 A red-hot combination of real beef, herbs, and spices is made bolder in taste and cooked to smooth perfection, as it adds some burning zest to the meat when served with other dishes. You can make the beef tender even when cooked and spicy.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ kg.  beef  sukiyaki  or  (1 ¾ lb.  beef brisket , cut into strips) 
 1 - 3 tsp.  Worcestershire sauce 
 ½ - 1 cup  coconut milk 
 2 tbsp.  lemon juice 
 2 tsp.  chile paste with garlic 
 2 tsp.  chili powder  optional 
 1 tsp. iodized fine  salt 
 1 tsp.  sugar , optional 
 ¼ cup cooking oil 
 1 tsp. chopped  garlic 
 ½ cup chopped  basil  leaves 
 ½ cup chopped  cilantro 
 Directions : 
 Marinate beef in Worcestershire sauce, sugar (optional), coconut milk, lemon juice, chili-garlic sauce, chili powder (optional), and salt. 
 Set aside for 15 minutes, then drain beef from marinade. Reserve the marinade. 
 Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Sauté garlic, then add beef. Stir-fry until brown. 
 Add the marinade, basil, and cilantro. Cook for another 3 minutes. Serve hot and plain with rice. 
 Notes : 
 You can normally substitute the beef sukiyaki for the sliced beef brisket, beef strips, or beef cubes to mix with the Worcestershire sauce, coconut milk, lemon juice, chili powder, and salt. 
 Chili-garlic sauce would sometimes be replaced with the chili paste.
