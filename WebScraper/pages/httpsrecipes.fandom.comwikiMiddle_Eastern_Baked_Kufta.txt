 Description : 
 Prep Time: 15 minutes | Total Time: 1 hour 
 Servings: 6 – 8 
 Ingredients : 
 3 lbs  ground beef  or  lamb  or  turkey 
 1 large  onion 
 ¾ – 1 cup finely chopped fresh  parsley 
 4  garlic  cloves 
 seasoning salt  or  salt 
 allspice 
 black pepper 
 garlic powder 
 topping : 
 3 – 4  tomatoes  (any size) 
 3 – 4  potatoes 
 Directions : 
 What you can do is start by chopping up your parsley in a food chopper until fine. 
 Do not use dried parsley. 
 Then put the parsley in a large mixing bowl. 
 Then cut onion up into pieces — doesn't matter how small just so you can fit it into the chopper and combine the garlic and chop away until fine — not pasty though. 
 Put the onion garlic mixture in the bowl with the parsley and add ground meat and spices. 
 Mix with hands until everything is well blended. 
 Pat the meat mixture down in the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan and broil in oven until top is browned, this will enhance the flavor, then take out of the oven. 
 Peel potatoes. 
 Slice tomatoes and potatoes into quarter of an inch in size and layer — potatoes first and then tomatoes will be top layer. 
 Sprinkle with a little salt — and bake in oven about 425°F covered with foil for approximately 45 minutes to and hour — enjoy.
