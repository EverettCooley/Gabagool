 Description : 
       Piparkakut (Gingerbread Cookies)     
 Ingredients : 
 3 dl (1.5 c)  Sugar 
 2 dl (1 c) syrup ( molasses ) 
 1 Tbs  cinnamon 
 1 Tbs  ginger 
 1 Tbs ground cloves 
 2 tsp  baking soda 
 2 dl (1 c)  cream  or full  milk 
 100 g (3.5 oz)  butter  or  margarine 
 2 tsp  salt 
 700 g (1.5 lb)  flour 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix the soda into the  milk . Combine the remaining ingredients, including the milk-soda mixture. Mix well, adding  flour  if the dough seems to stick. Form a ball and place in a plastic bag or a covered bowl and let stand overnight. 
 Cut into three or four sections. One at a time, roll out into a fairly thin round with a rolling pin, using extra  flour  if the dough sticks. With cookie cutters, such as star, crescent moon, Santa, angel, etc., cut shapes and bake in a 200 °C (400 °F) oven for about 7-10 mins, or until golden brown on the bottom. Cool flat. 
 Decorate with frosting, such as comes in CakeMate tubes, or make your own favorite frosting. Let dry overnight. Store in an airtight container.
