Description : 
 This recipe has no fat and is delicious!! enjoy!. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large can of  tomatoes  (whole or chopped) 
 1 can  tomato paste 
 1 x 6 oz can of  V-8  (I like the spicy kind) 
 3 large  potatoes , peeled and cut into large chunks 
 4  celery  stalks, chopped into lg chunks 
 1 large  onion , chopped into large chunks 
 1 cup or more large, fresh cleaned  mushrooms  (left whole) 
 5  carrots , cut into large chunks 
 1 quarter head of fresh,  green cabbage , cut into big chunks 
 1 can  green beans 
 1 can  lima beans 
 1 can  corn 
 1  bay leaf 
 2 cubes (b**f) or  vegetable bouillon 
 enough  water  to cover veggies by about 2 inches 
 seasoning to taste 
 Directions : 
 Add all ingredients to a large kettle, squeezing or cubing whole  tomatoes , so that their juices become part of the mixture. 
 Cover and let simmer for several hours, adding  water  as necessary, until the veggies are fully cooked and the flavors have had the chance to mix. 
 (this soup is really better the second day). 
 I have not included can sizes, since how much (or what you add) really depends on your personal taste ( hominy , for instance, is something I sometimes add, and is really good!)
