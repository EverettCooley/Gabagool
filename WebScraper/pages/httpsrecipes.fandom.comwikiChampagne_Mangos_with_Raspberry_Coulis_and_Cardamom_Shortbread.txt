 Ingredients : 
 2 cups fresh  raspberries 
 2 to 4 teaspoons  Raw Sugar Simple Syrup 
 2 Champagne  mangos , or one large regular  mango , cut from the pit, peeled and sliced 
 Four 4-by-3 inch  Cardamom Shortbread Cookies 
 4 tablespoons raw cane  Sugar 
 Directions : 
 Put the  raspberries  in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Slowly add the  simple syrup  to taste, depending on the sweetness of the  raspberries . Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
 
 Slice the  mango  halves into fans.
 
 Lay the cookies on a broiler pan. Set the fans of top of each cookie and sprinkle each with one tablespoon raw  Sugar . With a small blowtorch, caramelize the  Sugar . If you don't have a blowtorch, slice the broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 3 inches from the heat source to caramelize. Either way, watch the  Sugar  closely; it will caramelize in about one minute.
 
 Place each cookie on a dessert plate. Drizzle the  raspberry  coulis around the cookie on the plate.
 
 Recommended technique:  mangos  are messy to work with, and it may take some practice before you can successfully halve or quarter them. Each  mango  has two flattened "faces," front and back. Cut off the fruit of one face straight down next to the large flat seed. Cut off the other face of the fruit, peel away the skin and cut off the fruit on the bottom, top and sides. Fan or dice the  mango .
