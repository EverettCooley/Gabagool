A healthy Indian breakfast
 
 
 Prep Time: 30 minutes, Fermentation ( 4 Hours) 
 Cook time: 2 minutes 
 Serves: 4 Adults 
 
 Ingredients : 
 100 g of split red gram dal ( toor dal ) 
 150 g of split green gram dal ( moong dal ) 
 100 g of Bengal gram dal ( channa dal ) 
 50 g of  urad dal  (black gram dal) 
 400 g of  brown rice  (brown rice is a much better source of unrefined carbs than polished rice) 
 Directions : 
 Soak rice for 4 hours and the lentils for 2 hours. 
 Grind the mixture into a thick paste. 
 This batter needs to be fermented for 4â€“6 hours and refrigerated overnight. 
 Herbs and spices like coriander, ginger, pepper / red chilli and cumin seeds can be added during grinding for additional taste. 
 Add salt according to taste and pour the batter into a thin pancake over a hot griddle. 
 Cook till the top side appears spongy. 
 Turn the pancake and cook till golden brown (total griddling time will be for about 2 minutes). 
 Use olive oil to moisten the griddle plate and enjoy the  delicious healthy breakfast . 
 Variation : 
 You can choose to flavor the batter with onion/ ginger/ fresh herbs as per taste. Most popular Indian breakfast items are a combination of cereals & pulses. This combination provides carbohydrates & protein; both of which are important at the start of the day. To top this, these breakfast items are fermented too. Fermentation coverts carbohydrates & sugar into beneficial acids, thereby increasing the nutritive value of these breakfast items
