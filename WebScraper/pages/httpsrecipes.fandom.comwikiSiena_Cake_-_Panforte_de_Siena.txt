 NOTE:
 
 The Julesong photo accompanying this cake was taken about a month after it was made, because this cake can keep for so long and we forgot to take pics when it was newly done and the  powdered sugar  was still all pretty. 
 Please excuse the slightly messy nature of the cake in the photo :).
