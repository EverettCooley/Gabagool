Ingredients : 
 2-1/3 cups all purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1 / 2  teaspoon salt and pepper to taste 
 2-3 large tomatoes (need about 2-1/2 cups of pureed tomato) 
 1 / 2  cup brown sugar (can add 1/4 cup more if you like a bit sweeter cake) 
 1 / 2  cup a neutral flavored oil (canola is good) 
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 Start by whisking together all the dry ingredients into a big bowl. Take tomatoes, remove core, chop into chunks, and place into a blender. Blend tomatoes until a smooth and frothy puree. Now add in the sugar, oil, vanilla, and apple cider vinegar and blend until incorporated. Pour wet mixture into dry and stir until combined. 
 Pour the cake batter into a greased (and floured if you want. I find it helps to make sure all the nooks are greases) and stick into preheated oven. Bake for 45-50 minutes until it's a dark reddish golden brown and a tester (I use a fork) comes out clean when stabbed. 
 Remove from oven and let cool for a minute or two then invert cake, give the pan a few tap taps and hope that it comes out all nice and clean. (don't worry if a piece gets stuck, you can just dust the top with some powdered sugar) Let cake cool and when ready, cut a slice and eat it up.  
 Optional. Powdered sugar or a lemon glaze (lemon zest, lemon juice and powdered sugar) would be nice to top the cake off (but doesn't need it)
