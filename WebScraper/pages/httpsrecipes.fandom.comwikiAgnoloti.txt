 Wikipedia Article  About Agnolotti on Wikipedia 
 Agnolotti (which is the plural form of the italian word Agnolotto) is a kind of pasta made with a small square piece of flattened pasta dough, folded over with a meat and vegetable stuffing inside. Although their primitive shape was circular, nowadays they are of a square shape. In some case they can also come with a rectangular shape, when they are pinched (Agnolotti 'al plin'). They are  typical of  Langhe  and  Monferrato  areas in Piedmont region in Italy. They are prepared by either poaching them or by browning them in a frying pan with butter.
