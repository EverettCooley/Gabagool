INGREDIENTS 
 14-16 ounces homemade pizza dough
 1/3 cup basil pesto
 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese - shredded
 2 cups kale - chopped
 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 2 ounces goat cheese - crumbled
 arugula - for topping
 balsamic glaze
 INSTRUCTIONS 
 Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Spread a thin coat of olive oil on a baking sheet. 
 Roll the pizza dough into a thin circle. (We love thin crust pizza, so we roll ours out fairly thin). Carefully transfer the pizza dough to the baking sheet.
 Spread the basil pesto into an even layer on top of the pizza dough. 
 Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the pesto. 
 In a medium sized bowl combine the kale, olive oil, and salt and pinch of black pepper. Using your hands, massage the kale until the leaves become droopy and soft, about 2 minutes. 
 Spread the kale in an even layer over the mozzarella cheese. 
 Disperse the crumbled goat cheese over the kale. 
 Bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is golden in color and cooked through. 
 Remove the pizza from the oven and top with fresh arugula and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Enjoy!
