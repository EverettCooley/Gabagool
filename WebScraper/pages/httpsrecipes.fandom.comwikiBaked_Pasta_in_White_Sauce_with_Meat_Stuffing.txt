 Description : 
 I first ate a slight variation of this recipe at an American Diner called Sparky's, in Chennai. I guessed the ingredients by their flavours and made it at home. The result was just as good if not better. At the restaurant they had used chicken steak instead of minced meat, but I prefer my pasta this way. The creamy testure of the sauce goes best with Penne Pasta or Macaroni, although you can try making this with fusilli or fettucini.
 
 Ingredients : 
 300 g  penne  pasta  or   macaroni 
 200 g  minced chicken  /  mutton 
 1 cup of grated  cheddar  cheese 
 salt  to taste 
 Meat marinade : 
 1  green chili  chopped 
 2 pods of  garlic  chopped 
 2 tbsp of  red wine   or   grape juice 
 White sauce : 
 1 tbsp of  clarified butter 
 1 tbsp of  cornflour 
 2 cups of full-cream  milk 
 6 pods of  garlic 
 ½ tsp of  oregano 
 water 
 salt  to taste 
 Bourbon sauce : 
 1 large  onion  sliced 
 ½ tbsp  sugar 
 ½ tbsp  clarified butter 
 Directions : 
 Meat marinade : 
 Add the wine, chopped garlic and chillies to the minced meat. Mix well and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes 
 Cook the pasta/macaroni with 1 tbs oil and a pinch of salt till al dente. Strain, cover and keep aside. 
 White sauce : 
 Melt the butter in a pan over low flame, add the chopped garlic and fry till they turn light brown. Reduce flame. 
 Mix the corn flour in the milk such that there are no lumps. 
 Slowly add this mixture to the butter in the pan, stirring continuously. 
 Add water slowly till the sauce reaches a thick smooth consistency. 
 Add oregano, salt and freshly ground pepper. 
 Remove ⅖ of the sauce from the pan and keep aside. 
 Add the pasta to the remaining sauce and mix well. Cover and cook for 5 minutes over slow flame. 
 Bourbon sauce : 
 Melt the butter in a pan and caramelise the sugar in it. 
 Add the onions to this and saute till it becomes brown. 
 Reduce flame and add the white sauce. Add salt and cook for 2 minutes. 
 Add the marinated meat to this and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes till the meat is cooked. Remove from flame. 
 In a baking dish arrange a layer of the pasta and spread half of the cheddar cheese. 
 Pour the meat and bourbon sauce over this. Finally top it up with the remaining pasta. Spread the remaining cheese. 
 Place in an oven preheated at 150 °C. for 5 minutes till the cheese turns brown. Alternately, you can microwave this at medium-high for 10 minutes. 
 Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves and serve with buttered, toasted baguettes.
