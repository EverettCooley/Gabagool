 Wikipedia Article  About Coon on Wikipedia 
 Coon is the trademark of a cheddar cheese produced by Dairy Farmers in Australia.
 Despite a legal challenge to the name by Stephen Hagan in 2003, the name has nothing to do with the more commonly known racial slur use of the word and is instead named after its creator Edward William Coon, who patented a method for fast maturation of cheese via high temperature and humidity. The original trademark owner Kraft, and later Dairy Farmers have vigorously defended this trademark.
 The trademark was originally Red Coon and at the time the cheese was coated with red wax. The wax was later replaced with cellophane and the red stripe in the logo is a residual reference to the original packaging.
