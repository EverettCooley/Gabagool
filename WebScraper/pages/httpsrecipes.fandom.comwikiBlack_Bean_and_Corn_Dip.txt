 Description 
 Black beans and real corn go well for extra crispy zest. Make the vegetable-based dip tangier with other herbs and spices.
 
 Ingredients 
 1 - 15 oz. can  black beans , drained and rinsed  or  (2 cups cooked black beans) 
 2 cups cooked, fresh, frozen or canned  corn , toasted in a dry, non-stick pan until caramelized  or  (2 cans fresh corn) 
 2  green onions , sliced 
 ½ cup plain nonfat  yogurt 
 ½ teaspoon thyme 
 ½ teaspoon dry, roasted cumin seeds, ground 
 ½ of a chipotle chili in adobo sauce 
 black pepper  to taste 
 Directions 
 Set aside ½ cup of beans and ½ cup of corn (or 1 can of fresh corn). 
 Place all remaining ingredients in a blender. Blend for about 20 seconds or until all ingredients are smooth. 
 Mix with the reserved beans and corn, either fresh or from the can, for a bit of texture and spoon or scoop the vegetable-based dip in a large bowl before cooling in the refrigerator. Pair this with corn, tortilla or potato chips or other appetizers or side dishes. 
 Notes 
 If the dip is too thick, then mix with two tablespoons of yogurt.
