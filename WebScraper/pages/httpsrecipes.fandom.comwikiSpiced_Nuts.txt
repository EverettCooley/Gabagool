 1½ tbsp  water 
 1½ cup  pecan  halves,  walnut  halves,  cashews  or a combination 
 Directions : 
 In a deep, 2-quart, heat-resistant, non-metallic casserole, combine first 7 ingredients 
 Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 1½ minutes; stir occasionally. 
 Add ½ cup  nuts  at a time to syrup mixture. Stir until well coated. 
 With a slotted spoon lift out  nuts ; drain extra syrup. 
 Place  nuts  in a shallow, 1½-quart, heat-resistant, non-metalic baking dish.
