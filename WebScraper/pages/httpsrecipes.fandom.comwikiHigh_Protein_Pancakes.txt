Description 
 High Protein Pancakes  from Recipes for Better Nutrition During Cancer Treatment by the National Cancer Institute, public domain government resource—original source of recipe 
 These pancakes have double the protein of regular pancakes. Two of them equal one ounce of meat in protein content.
 
 Ingredients 
 ½ cup  milk 
 2 tbsp  dry milk 
 1 egg (2 for a thinner,  crêpe -type  pancake ) 
 2 tsps of  oil 
 ½-¾ cups pancake mix 
 
 
 Directions 
 Measure milk, dry milk, egg, and oil into blender or bowl. Beat until egg is well blended. 
 Add pancake mix. Stir or blend at low speed until mix is wet but some lumps remain. 
 Cook on hot, greased griddle or frying pan. Turn when firm to brown the other side. 
 These can be kept warm in a warm oven or in a covered pan on low heat. Makes seven 4" pancakes. 
 Note 
 If there is batter left over, it will keep 1 day in the refrigerator, or it can be made into pancakes, cooled, and wrapped in foil to be frozen for later use. To reheat, leave in foil and place in 450 °F oven for 15 minutes. If using a toaster oven, unwrap them, brush with margarine, and toast as for light toast.
