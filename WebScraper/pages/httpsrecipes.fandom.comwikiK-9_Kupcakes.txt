 Ingredients : 
 Kupcakes: 
 
 1 cup  flour 
 1 tsp.  baking soda 
 1/4 cooking  oil 
 1 cup shredded  carrots 
 1 tsp  vanilla 
 1/3 cup honey 
 1  egg 
 Frosting: 
 
 
 1/2 cup  Peanut   butter 
 1/3 cup honey 
 1/4 cup  sour cream 
 
 Directions : 
 Mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, and combine quickly (dunno why the directions said that).
 
 It makes like a pastry batter, so you need to fill up the muffin tins with about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the batter.
 
 Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.
 
 Mix together and frost the kupcakes when they have cooled.
 
 (Measurements are pretty accurate, I did this one on my own and mixed it up to the consistency I like.)
