 About White rum : 
 Wikipedia Article  About White rum on Wikipedia 
 Light rum (also known as "silver" or "white" rum), is a dry, light-bodied rum, light in color and lightly sweet in flavor. It is produced from sugarcane juice and molasses, and normally has a short distillation period.
 Unlike other various rums which are aged in charred oak casks, light rum is simply aged in plain oak casks or stainless steel tanks, so it remains clear. Light rum is often the favored choice of rum for cocktails and other mixed drinks.
 Light rum is generally 80 proof. It is frequently flavored with orange, lemon, or other tropical fruits.
