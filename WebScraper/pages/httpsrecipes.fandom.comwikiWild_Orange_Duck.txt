INGREDIENTS
1 wild duck (can use domestic duck also)
1/2 orange
1/2 c. orange juice
Salt
2 tbsp. fat
 PREPARATION
Prick the skin off the duck with a fork. Sprinkle the body cavity with
salt and place the orange half inside the bird. If the duck has been
split up the back, tie string around it to hold the body cavity
closed. Heat your pressure cooker, add fat and brown duck. Remove
excess fat and add orange juice. Close cover securely, place the
regulator on steam vent and cook for 25 minutes at 15 pounds pressure.
Let the pressure drop of its own accord, then serve.
