 Makes 6 servings
 
 
    3 large green bell peppers                                      
   3 large tomatoes                                                
   1-1/2 cups cooked white rice                                    
   1 onion, chopped                                                
   1/2 bunch chopped cilantro                                      
   1 tablespoon minced garlic                                      
   1 pound ground beef                                             
   1 6-ounce can tomato paste                                      
   3 tablespoons lemon juice                                       
   Salt and pepper to taste                                        
   ' 20-ounce can spaghetti sauce                                  
   1 28-ounce jar spaghetti sauce or homemade spaghetti sauce      
 
 In a skillet, brown the ground beef and sautï¿½ the onions, cilantro,
and garlic. Add rice and lemon juice. Stir in just enough tomato
sauce to make a moist mixture. Salt and pepper to taste. Using a
sharp knife, slice off the tops of peppers and tomatoes. Scoop out the
seeds and inner fleshy parts of the tomatoes. Scoop the rice/beef
mixture into the hollows of each pepper and tomato, mounding high over
the tops. Set on rack in cooker (or for easier removal, place in
steamer tray). Add minimum amount of water required by your cooker,
or enough water to just reach top of rack or trivet. Lock the lid and
bring to full pressure. Lower heat, maintaining pressure, and cook
for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool naturally for 5 minutes, then
quick-release any remaining pressure. Remove peppers and tomatoes
using 2 serving spoons.
 To serve, ladle heated spaghetti sauce on a plate and set tomato or
pepper in it. Serve additional sauce over the top, as desired.
 Cook's Note: If your cooker is too small to cook all the stuffed
vegetables at once, cook them in batches. If peppers or tomatoes
threaten to topple, place a heat-proof plate on top of them to keep
them upright during cooking. Heat and serve any remaining beef/rice
mixture with spaghetti sauce, or freeze for another meal.
