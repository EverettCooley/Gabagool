 About gin fizz cocktail : 
 A cocktail made with gin, lemon juice, sugar, and soda, served in a tall glass over ice. When an egg white is added, then the drink is called a silver fizz. Adding orange-flower water and cream or milk to a silver fizz transforms it into a Ramos gin fizz, a New Orleans original created in the late 1800s by bar owner Henry Ramos.
