Description : 
 A superb way of cooking  Cauliflower , given to me by a Lebanese chef. The florets are stir-fried with  olive oil ,  garlic  and lots of fresh coriander, and the result is irresistible.
 
 This recipe is for 2 servings. 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ large  cauliflower 
 4 tbsp  olive oil 
 2  garlic  cloves, sliced 
 1 small bunch of  coriander , chopped 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  cauliflower  into tiny florets. 
 Heat the  olive oil  gently and sauté the sliced  garlic  in it until soft, about 2 – 3 minutes. 
 Turn the heat up and stir-fry the  cauliflower  florets for a further 2 – 3 minutes, tossing so that they are well coated with the  oil . 
 Turn the heat down, partially cover with a lid, and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. 
 Stir in the chopped coriander, toss for 1 minute more, and serve.
