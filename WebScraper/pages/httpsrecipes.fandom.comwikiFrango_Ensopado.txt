      Frango Ensopado     
 Ingredients : 
 1  chicken  cut up into pieces 
 2  onions 
 1  lime 
 1 tbsp  salt 
 1 teaspoon  garlic powder 
 1 teaspoon  annatto  powder (known in Brazil as urucum). 
 1 cup of freshly chopped  parsley  with  green onions 
 ½ cup  oil 
 1 lb of chopped  okra 
 Directions : 
 In a large sauté pan, combine the  oil ,  salt ,  garlic powder , two chopped  onions , and annatto powder. 
 Place the  chicken  pieces and fry. 
 Move the pieces with a wood spoon to evenly fry the pieces and make them get the yellow color from the annatto. 
 Fry for about 20 minutes, or until medium done, and drain excess of fat. 
 Return the sauté pan to heat and add about two cups of  water  to make a sauce. 
 Simmer for about 10 minutes and finally combine the cup of chopped  parsley ,  green onions  and the  lime juice . 
 Add  okra  (you can buy them at any frozen section of grocery stores) and cook until tender.
