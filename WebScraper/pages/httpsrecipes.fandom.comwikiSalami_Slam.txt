 This is something we use on a very regular basis when friends just pop in... and it has been a success every time
 
 Ingredients : 
 Chicken Salami - about 3-4 pieces per person 
 a small lettuce head - leaves all picked out 
 peanuts- crushed into a rough chunky state 
 apple cider or vinegar 
 honey 
 mustard 
 Directions : 
 Take the 5-6 tablespoons of vinegar/apple cider and add honey and mustard (to taste) 
 once thats nicely mixed add the crushed peanuts and spoon the mixture together 
 Take a lettuce leaf, place a salami piece,spoon a little peanut mixture over the salami piece 
 fold the lettuce and the salami piece in half- in a way that the lettuce piece effectively blocks out both the sides so the mixture doesn't drip out. 
 Use a toothpick to hold the salami in place and serve with gherkins/pickles.
