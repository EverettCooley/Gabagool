 The Austrian cuisine is not very rich in salad recipes. However, there exist some specific Austrian salads that go well with their well-known meat dishes. Besides creating original salads, they have adapted some international recipes to their own taste. Such an example is the  Austrian Caesar Salad . The ingredients vary, but are mostly vegetables - potatoes, beans, carrots, tomatoes, and fruits - apples.
