Ingredients : 
 ⅓ cup plus 2 Tbsp. olive oil, divided 
 2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 
 1 tsp. minced fresh parsley 
 ⅛ tsp. red pepper flakes 
 2 lbs. pizza dough 
 2 Tbsp. cornmeal 
 3 cups grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise 
 1 cup toasted pine nuts 
 1 lb. Brie, rind removed, diced 
 ¼ cup fresh basil leaves 
 1 cup shredded Gruyère cheese 
 Directions : 
 In a saucepan or skillet, warm ⅓ cup olive oil over medium-low heat. Add garlic, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes or until garlic has softened. Set aside to cool. 
 Roll out two circles of dough. Coat deep-dish pizza pans with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place dough circles in the pans and press dough up the sides. 
 Divide garlic-olive oil mixture over the two pizzas and spread over the bottom of the crust. 
 Spread 1½ cups of halved grape tomatoes over each crust, followed by ½ cup of pine nuts. Divide Brie between the two pizzas and distribute evenly over the crusts. Sprinkle fresh basil leaves and ½ cup of Gruyère cheese over each pizza. 
 Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake pizzas until crust is light brown and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes.
