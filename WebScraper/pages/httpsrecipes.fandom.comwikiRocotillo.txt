 About Rocotillo : 
 A Rocotillo pepper (Capsicum baccatum) is a type of chile pepper that originated in Peru. Unripe rocotillos are green or yellow, but the color at maturity varies. Common colors are red, orange or brown. Rocotillos are almost spherical in shape, and can be dried easily. They are generally an inch long (2.5cm) and around an inch (2.5cm) wide.
 Most rocotillos rate between 1 and 500 Scoville units.
