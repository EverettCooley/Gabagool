 About Porcino : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Porcino on Wikipedia 
 This mushroom also called as 'bolet ou Porcini' in French or 'Stone mushrooms' in English and 'Porcini' in Italian, grows up to 30 cm in size and 2 pounds in weight. Small ones were preferred. They are meaty, delicious, white to brown in color, used in soups, sauces, stuffings, and other dishes.
 Porcini mushrooms have a rich, meaty flavor. Also known by the French term "cèpes," they are available fresh or dried. When selecting fresh porcini, look for firm, plump mushrooms that are not slimy or bruised. 
 Porcini have a large, round cap that is pale yellowish brown to dark reddish brown in color and grow 2 to 8 inches in width. They grow on the ground under conifers and hardwood trees in the North American woods. The cap and stem have a firm, thick, white flesh with a distinctive and assertive flavor and is excellent used in soups, sauces, stuffing, fish and other dishes. They are available fresh, frozen and dried and can be broiled, sautéed, stewed or baked.
