Description : 
 With such avast area of fruit-producing lands within the tropics,  Australians  are blessed with a year-round variety of fresh  fruit  that are both nutritious and deliciously sweet.  Pawpaws  and  bananas  are available continuously and are valuable sources of  potassium , the nerve and muscle nourisher and water-retention regulator, and high-energy  fructose .  Mangoes  are also high in potassium, as well as being excellent sources of vitamins A and C. As mangoes are only available during summer, suitable alternatives are  custard apples  and  persimmons , both of which are fibre-rich. And custard apples are even higher in potassium than bananas. The best  dates  are imported from California and are similarly high in potassium, as well as in iron,  niacin , fibre and fructose. This fruit salad is, therefore, ideal for active, busy people.
