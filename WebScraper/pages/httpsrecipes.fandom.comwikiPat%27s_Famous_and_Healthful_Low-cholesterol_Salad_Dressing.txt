Description : 
 Pat Piper of Sonoma, California, sends us her recipe rather assertively called  Pat's Famous and Healthful Low Cholesterol Salad Dressing . She first tried a balancing act of 1 to 1 (equal parts  oil  and  vinegar ). But overly tart results pushed her back to traditional ratios of 3 ( oil ) to 1 ( vinegar ). She then elected to combine predominantly monounsaturated  olive oil  with three significantly polyunsaturated vegetable oils, hoping to bring better nutrition by way of variety. Liking the concept of variety, she also combined several vinegars.
