 Ingredients : 
 blackberries  - 450 g, (1 lb), fresh or frozen, thawed, 
 egg  whites - 2, 
 caster sugar  - 50 g (2 oz), 
 double cream  - 300 ml. 
 Directions : 
 Purée the  blackberries  and rub through a nylon sieve. 
 Pour the purée into a rigid container and freeze for about 2 hours. 
 Whisk the  egg  whites until stiff, then add the  Sugar  gradually, whisking until the mixture stands in soft peaks. 
 Whip the  cream  until it just holds its shape. 
 Remove the frozen  blackberry  purée from the freezer and mash to break down any large  ice  crystals, being careful not to break it down completely. 
 Fold the  cream  and  egg  whites together, then quickly fold in the semi-frozen  blackberry  puree to form a swirled effect. 
 Spoon into tall glasses and serve immediately.
