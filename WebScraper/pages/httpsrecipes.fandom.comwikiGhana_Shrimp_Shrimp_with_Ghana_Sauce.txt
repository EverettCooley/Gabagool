Gradually stir in the spice mixture until the paste is smooth. Heat about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until hot. Cool for a dipping sauce. Cool for a marinade. Freeze for future use.
 Alternative: Heat  paprika ,  cumin  and ground coriander in a dry pan over low to medium-low heat to "toast" and renew the dried spices. Remove from the heat and transfer to a 1-cup pyrex measure for further blending. Add the other spices to the pan. Stirring constantly, add the wine and make a paste.
