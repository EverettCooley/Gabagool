Pot roasting is the term applied to cooking larger joints or cuts in a similar way to braising. However, it is carried out in a deep covered pot without any, or with barely any liquid. The meat is seared or browned first in a little butter or oil, then placed on a bed of browned root vegetables, or bones and vegetables. The pot is tightly covered and the meat cooked gently. A pot roast may be cooked in a pot or pressure cooker, in a brat kettle, or in the oven. The small amount of liquid and the vegetables produce sufficient steam to make this a moist heat method ideal for the medium-tender roasting cuts. Lamb meat is naturally tender so most of the market ready cuts can be roasted with success. Of course, some cuts are tenderer than others, but the shanks and the neck are the only cuts that must be cooked with moist heat methods. The shoulder cuts are often best when braised, but are also excellent when carefully roasted and are not overcooked. Shoulder from a young lamb is more likely to be tender. Shoulder, rib roast, and loin are ideal cuts for roasting. Baby, or hothouse, lamb is also roasted, but because the meat is so tender and has so little fat, special procedures should be followed. In general, a roast should have a crisp brown surface and a juicy pink inter.
