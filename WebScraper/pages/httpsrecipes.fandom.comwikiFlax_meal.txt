Flax meal, sometimes called flaxseed flour, is simply ground  flax seeds . It can be ground on demand or purchased pre-ground. There are two basic kinds of flax meal: brown, or regular, flax meal and golden flax meal.
 This is also a good low-carb flour substitute. To get the best quality baked good, substitute a quarter of your flour with ground flaxseeds. You may want to reduce the oven temperature slightly since flax meal causes baked goods to brown more quickly. The finished product may be a bit heavier and chewier than those made with conventional flours. You may want to add additional liquid to your recipe when using flax meal as a low-carb flour substitute.
