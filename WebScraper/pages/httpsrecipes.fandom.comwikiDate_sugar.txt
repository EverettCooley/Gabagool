      Date sugar     
 Date sugar  is different from  sugar cane  and  beets . It is not derived from sugar cane or beets like granulated sugar, but is simply very finely chopped dried dates. Because it doesn't melt like granulated sugar, it cannot not be directly substituted without changing the nature of the item being baked or otherwise created. 
 Many people still prefer to use it because it goes through less processing than "regular" sugar. If you do use it, just bear in mind that the finished recipe might not be exactly the same as expected, which is not to say that it cannot still be tasty.
