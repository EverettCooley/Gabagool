 Ingredients : 
 Dough 
 1 pkg.  active dry yeast  (1 Tbs.) 
 1 tsp.  Sugar 
 1/4 cup hot  water 
 1/4 cup honey 
 1/4  vegetable oil 
 1/4 cup  orange juice 
 3 3/4 to 4 cups unbleached  all-purpose flour  (approximately) 
 1 tsp.  salt 
 Filling 
 4 Tbs.  butter , softened 
 3 Tbs.  Sugar 
 2 Tbs. grated  orange peel 
 Glaze 
 2 cups  powdered sugar 
 4 Tbs.  orange juice , preferably fresh squeezed 
 Directions : 
 1. In small bowl, dissolve  yeast , 1 teaspoon  Sugar  and hot  water . Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes.
 2. In medium bowl, mix honey,  oil ,  orange juice  and 1/2 cup  water . Set aside.
 3. In food processor, combine 3 3/4 cups  flour  and  salt . Add  yeast  mixture and honey mixture, and process until dough forms a ball. Pulse on/off 4 to 5 times, until dough looks silky. Dough should not be sticky; If dough is sticky, add more  flour , 1 tablespoon at a time. Place dough into lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
 4. Punch down dough, and turn out onto lightly floured surface. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into rectangle, approximately 14 x 9 inches. Spread  butter  over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle  Sugar  and  orange peel  over  butter . Starting with long edge, roll dough into a spiral, jelly roll-style. Pinch edges together to seal. Cut roll into 12 slices. Place slices on well-greased baking sheet. Cover rolls with greased plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until rolls are almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
 5. Preheat oven to 350 °F. Uncover rolls, and bake until light golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven, and let cool slightly. While rolls are cooling, mix  powdered sugar  and  orange juice  in small bowl until well blended. Drizzle icing over rolls. Serve warm.
