Description : 
 Similar to the simplified, flavored pita chips, this countrified Cajun appetizer is made and packed only with Cajun seasoning, as it maintains a robust, crispy taste with the pitas.
 
 Ingredients : 
 5  pitas 
 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning 
 cooking spray 
 Directions : 
 Split five pitas in half, and cut each half into eight wedges with the chef's knife. 
 Preheat an oven to 375 °F. 
 Arrange pita wedges on greased baking sheets. 
 Coat wedges with the cooking spray. 
 Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning over wedges. 
 Bake chips for 6 minutes, or until crisp. Serve hot and plain with other appetizers or side dishes or with a dip of choice.
