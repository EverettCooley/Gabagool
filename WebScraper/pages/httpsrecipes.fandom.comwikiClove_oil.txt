 About clove oil : 
 Clove oil is an essential oil from the  clove  plant, Syzygium aromaticum.
 It is a natural analgaesic and antiseptic used primarily in dentistry for its main ingredient eugenol. It can also be purchased in pharmacies over the counter, as a home remedy for dental pain relief, mainly toothache; it is also often found in the aromatherapy section of health food stores. The oil produced by cloves can be used in many things from flavouring medicine to remedies for bronchitis, the common cold, a cough, fever, sore throat and tending to infections. The main oil-producing countries are Madagascar and Indonesia.
 There are three types of clove oil:
 
 Bud oil is derived form the flower-buds of S.aromaticum. It consists of 60-90% eugenol, eugenyl acetate, caryophyllene and other minor constituents. 
 Leaf oil is derived from the leaves of S.aromaticum. It consists of 82-88% eugenol with little or no eugenyl acetate, and minor constituents. 
 Stem oil is derived from the twigs of S.aromaticum. It consists of 90-95% eugenol, with other minor constituents.
