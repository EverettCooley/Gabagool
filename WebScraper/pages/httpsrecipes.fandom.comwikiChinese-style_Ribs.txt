 Description : 
 An international combination of real pork, herbs, spices, and soy sauce is enriched with sesame oil, hoisin sauce, fruit juice, and vinegar, and cooked to red-hot perfection, as it best provides the meat with some reddish zest based in China. Five-spice powder occasionally works for this, too.
