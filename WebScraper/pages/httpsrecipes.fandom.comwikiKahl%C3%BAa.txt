 About Kahlúa : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Kahlúa on Wikipedia 
 Kahlúa is a famous Mexican coffee liqueur. It is heavy and sweet, with a very distinct taste of Mexican coffee, which gives it a dark brown colour. It has been produced by Allied Domecq which was acquired in 2005 by Pernod Ricard.
 
 Alcohol content: formerly 26.5%, recently lowered to 20% in most markets to be more compatible with liquor laws in many areas. In 2003 a higher-priced premium product called Kahlúa Especial became available in the United States after previously being offered only in the Duty-Free market. Made with Arabica coffee beans, it has an alcohol content of 35% with lower viscosity and sweetness.
