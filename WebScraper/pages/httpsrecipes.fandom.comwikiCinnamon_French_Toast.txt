 Description : 
 If you're NOT into Cinnamon, this is NOT the French toast for you. It has a lot of cinnamon. It's usually served with banana slices that surround the plate. A mimosa in a champagne flute is a nice touch. Premium grade maple syrup is required.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 Eggs 
 2-3 cups of 2% lowfat milk 
 Bottle of Cinnamon                 
 4-5 slices of bread (whole wheat or white works) 
 1 whole banana 
 Spray olive oil or butter for frying pan 
 Directions : 
 Slice your banana into thin slices and dress your plate 
 Put the frying pan on the grill and turn heat to medium and gently spray with olive oil or add a thick inch of butter into the frying pan. 
 While you're letting the pan heat up, grab a bowl that can hold enough milk and egg content. 
 Crack two eggs into the bowl. 
 Briskly whisk the eggs with a whisker 
 Add 2-3 cups of milk, whisk briskly 
 Put out a healthy amount of cinnamon into the bowl of contents. 
 Whisk all the content together for a good minute. 
 The frying pan should be hot and ready. 
 Take a piece of bread and completely submerge it into the bowl. (Front and back)            
 Do this for the other piece of bread. 
 Gently place them into the frying pan. 
 Pat some cinnamon over each piece of bread. 
 Wait about a min, then flip each piece of bread. 
 After both pieces of bread have been completely cooked place them on your plate. 
 Serve with HIGH GRADE MAPLE SYRUP 
 Enjoy
