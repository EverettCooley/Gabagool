 Puerto Rican cuisine is one of the most colourful of all Cuisines. You will be flabbergasted to find some of Puerto Rican recipes to be as old as the region itself. There are over 1,000 different dishes including national drinks, cakes and confectionary products. There are various kinds of snacks available in the Puerto Rican snack category of the Puerto Rico cuisine. A local Puerto Rican will tell you that the junk food variety is definitely not a part of the Puerto Rican snack category. Even so, traditionally prepared teas, national drinks, scrumptious cakes, soups and some other dishes which include the traditional Puerto Rican bread along with chicken, meat, and vegetable pieces garnished with cheese or hot sauces are a favourite among the people of Puerto Rico. The Puerto Ricans give special importance to their traditional beverages, so do not be surprised to find scrumptious sandwiches, and traditional desserts and other confectionary products to be served with the traditional beverages of Puerto Rico to complete a perfectly delicious and lip-licking Puerto Rican snack.
