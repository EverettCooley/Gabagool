Description : 
 Dressed with a tangy lemon vinaigrette and fresh mint, this invigorating and dairy-free potato salad makes the perfect summer potluck contribution.
 ChupaNote: as usual, couldn't help embellishing. Added a small jar of grilled  eggplant  in oil (drain oil), a handful of chopped  black olives , ¼ pound crumbled  feta  cheese, a handful of  capers , and a small jar of grilled  red peppers  (drain oil). Of course, with all that... needed more  mint  and a tablespoon of  red pepper flakes !!!
