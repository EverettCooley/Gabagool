 About Lard : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Lard on Wikipedia 
 Lard is an animal fat produced from rendering the fat portions of the pig. Lard was a commonly used cooking oil though its use in contemporary cuisine has been diminished due to the health concerns posed by saturated fat and cholesterol. Lard is still commonly used to manufacture soap by small-scale artisanal soapcrafters and large industries alike.
 
 Storage : 
 Lard can be stored at room temperature, but will keep fresh longer in the fridge along with your butter and margarine.
