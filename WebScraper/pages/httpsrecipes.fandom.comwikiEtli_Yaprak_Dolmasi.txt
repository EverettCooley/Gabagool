 Ingredients : 
 a jar of  grape  Leaves, 
 1 cup long  grain   rice , 
 liberal pinch of  salt , 
 1-2 large  onions ,finely chopped, 
 2 cloves of  garlic ,crushed, 
 2 Tbs finely chopped  Parsley , 
 pinch of ground  allspice , 
 pinch of ground black  pepper , 
 3 Tbs of olive  oil , 
 1 pound of ground meat ( Turkey , Beef  or  Lamb ), 
 juice of 1 to 2  lemons , 
 2 cups  chicken stock  or  water , 
 butter 
 Directions : 
 Cut the stems of the  grape  leaves.Place them in a large bowl,cover with boiling  water  and soak for 10â€“15 minutes and rinse with cold  water . Soak the  rice  in salted hot  water  for 25 minutes. Meanwhile saute the chopped  onions , garlic ,herbs and seasoning in the  oil . Remove from heat, add the drained  rice  and the meat,mixing everything together very well. Place a  grape  leave on a work surface, shiny side down, place about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture near the stem end,then fold in the end and sides and roll up neatly. Repeat this process until all the leaves are stuffed. Line the bottom of a large,heavy based pot with several  grape  leaves, then arrange the filled rolls in stacks with  lemon  slices between. Pour in the stock or the  water , add dabs of  butter  on the top. Place a heat proof dish on the top to keep the rolls pressed down. Cover with a lid and simmer slowly for 1 to 2 hours, or until the leaves are tender. Serve the "dolma" lukewarm,sprinkled with  lemon  juice. Alternatively, you may prefer to serve with a  garlic ,olive  oil  and  lemon  juice dressing. Garnish with halved  lemon  slices.
