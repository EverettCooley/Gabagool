Description : 
 How about a cocktail recipe? This drink probably has a name, but I've tried several on for size in local bars (Boston area) and drawn nothing but blank stares, so I just make it myself and call it "delicious."
 
 Ingredients : 
 Bourbon 
 lemonade 
 orange  slice or a  cherry 
 Directions : 
 Use a collins glass (these are called "(iced) tea glasses" in the south). 
 Fill half-way with  bourbon . 
 Add  ice . 
 Fill rest of the way with lemonade (the more tart the better). 
 Do not stir. 
 Garnish with an  orange  slice or a  cherry  if you're a girl, or gay or something. 
 Add a plastic sword (with or without the garnish) because plastic swords are cool, and can be used later to poke people who annoy you. 
 Drink. Repeat. Often.
