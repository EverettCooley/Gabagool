 Description : 
 This tangy pie is made with real fruit juice, tofu, and lime rind in a pastry shell.
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 (12.3 ounces) package  silken tofu 
 8 ounces soy  cream cheese 
 Â½ cup  key lime juice 
 2 teaspoons freshly grated  Lime peel 
 2 (4 ounces) packages Mori-Nu mates  vanilla  pudding mix (must be this brand--it's made to go with the  tofu ) 
 1 tablespoon liquid  sweetener , to taste 
 1 x 9 inch baked  pastry shell   or  (1 9-inch graham cracker crust) 
 Directions : 
 Drain any excess water from the tofu. 
 Blend tofu, vanilla extract, and lime juice in a processor or blender until creamy and smooth. 
 Add the rest of the ingredients except crust and blend again until smooth. 
 At this point, transfer the mixture to a bowl and beat on high speed with an electric mixer. 
 Pour the mixture into the crust and chill 2-3 hours or until firm. 
 This sets up very firm. It also makes a great pudding or little tartlet filling for fancy desserts. Serve cold and plain or with other desserts.
