Description : 
 A traditional caramelized tapioca sweet
 
 Ingredients : 
 1¾ cups of  sugar 
 ¾ cup of sako (tapioca), soaked in 1½ cups of  water  for 1 hour 
 1 tablespoon  saffron , soaked with the tapioca 
 ½ cup of  butter 
 ⅛ – ¼ cup of  rose water , depending on its strength and your tastes 
 1 tablespoon of ground  cardamom 
 1½ tablespoons ground  cinnamon 
 ½ teaspoon  ground ginger 
 chopped  nuts , such as  pistachio nuts  or  walnuts , optional 
 Directions : 
 Put the  sugar  in a heavy sauce pan and brown over medium heat. 
 Do not stir it, but rather gently shake the pan about every minute, until the  sugar  is a golden brown. 
 Be careful not to over do it and burn the  sugar . 
 Add the sako (tapioca) with its  water  and the rest of the ingredients along with 2 cups of  water . 
 Bring to a boil, while stirring. 
 The  sugar  will clump at the bottom of the pan at first, but will then gradually dissolve in the liquid. 
 Once it is boiling reduce heat to the lowest level. 
 Continue cooking, lightly boiling, until the sako (tapioca) is cooked (i. 
 E. 
 Clear and soft). 
 The time required for this will depend on the size of the sako (tapioca), with smaller tapioca cooking faster than the larger beads. 
 Add more  water , if need. 
 The final texture should be thick and jelly-like, yet still thin enough to pour into the serving dish. 
 Take off of the fire and spread in a glass/ceramic casserole dish/plate (or smaller individual-serving bowls). 
 Top with chopped  nuts  (optional). 
 Best eaten at room temperature or slightly warm.
