Serves : 12
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  sunflower seeds 
 ½ cup  sesame seeds 
 ¼ cup  almonds 
 3 cups  rolled oats 
 ¼ cup  flour 
 ½ cup  brown sugar   or   apple juice  concentrate, mixed with ½ cup  water 
 5 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 tablespoon  vanilla extract 
 3-4 tablespoons natural  maple syrup 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ½ cup dried fruit ( raisins ,  apricot  pieces,  cherries  or  cranberries ) 
 Directions : 
 Set oven to 350 °F. 
 In a dry, ungreased skillet, mix the seeds together with the nuts. 
 Stir frequently over a low flame, until you smell a toasty, warm scent. Alternately, you can toast the nuts and seeds in a pan in a toaster oven for 2 minutes on a low setting. 
 Combine the nuts and seeds with all other remaining ingredients (except  dried fruit ) in a large bowl. 
 Spread the resulting mixture on two cookie sheets. 
 Bake for approximately 20 minutes or until golden, flipping the mixture often using a spatula or spoon during baking. 
 Take out of oven. Stir in dried fruit. 
 Store in an airtight container.
