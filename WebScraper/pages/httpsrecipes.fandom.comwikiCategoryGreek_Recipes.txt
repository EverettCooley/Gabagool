This category was also influenced and punctuated by Italian, Balkan and Middle East cultures. Greece has always offered a great variety of fresh ingredients. The land provided olive trees, lemon trees, vineyards, while from the seas people took fish, shellfish in order to serve them baked, grilled, or fried. 
 The most important meal served in Greece is lamb which is braised and stewed in casseroles with vegetables and skewered and broiled. Beef, pork are always marinated, baked, or grilled and chicken is broiled and braised. Greek cuisine includes, among others, a combination of different meat and vegetable, often embellished with golden lemon sauce, cinnamon-spiced tomato sauce, or avgolemono. Obviously, Moussaka should be taken into consideration, together with fila pitas which consists of wafer-thin pastry, chicken, mushrooms, spinach, feta cheese, or lamb. Every meal would definitely have a special taste if you use mountain-grown herbs like oregano, garlic, basil, mint, and dill. The most famous pastry remains Baklava which contains nuts and honey syrup.
