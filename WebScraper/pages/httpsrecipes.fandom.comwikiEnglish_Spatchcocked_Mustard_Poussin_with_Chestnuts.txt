 Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp  whole grain mustard 
 2 baby  poussin  —  spatchcocked , washed and patted dry  [1] 
 2 tsp  sage  and  thyme , mixed chopped 
 2 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil 
 1 dessertspoons  butter 
 400 grams whole  chestnuts  — ready pealed 
 1 glass dry  white wine  — generous 
 Directions : 
 Spread the mustard on the inside and outside of each flattened bird. 
 Sprinkle with the sage and thyme and drizzle with a little oil. 
 Heat a griddle pan (frying pan will do) and, when hot, put both birds in and cook until brown all over - about five minutes on each side. 
 Put the birds in a warmed, lightly oiled, oven-proof dish, add the rest of the oil and butter to the pan with the chestnuts and stir gently to avoid breaking the nuts. 
 After five minutes, remove from the heat, add the wine and continue to cook for five minutes. 
 Pour all the sauce and chestnuts into a casserole dish, cover with foil, cook in a medium oven until the poultry juices run clear, about 15 – 20 minutes serve one per person surrounded by chestnuts with the sauce on top. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   If you're handy with a cleaver, do it yourself, but it's probably safer to ask your butcher. This is an old traditional English method for cooking any small bird. It's split down the back, flattened so they cook much more quickly in a frying pan, griddle or over hot charcoal. This gives intense flavour and prevents these little birds getting tough. The butcher will prepare them and fix them in place with a wooden skewer
