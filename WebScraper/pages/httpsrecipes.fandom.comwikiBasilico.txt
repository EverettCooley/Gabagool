 Ingredients : 
 3 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil  (3 times around the pan) 
 3 cloves  garlic , minced 
 2 cans (2 x 8 oz each) crushed  tomatoes , or diced in juice, if you like chunky tomato sauce 
 20 leaves fresh  basil , roughly cut or torn 
 Directions : 
 Heat  olive oil  and  garlic  in a deep pan over medium heat. 
 When the  garlic  squeaks, add  tomatoes  and heat through. 
 Stir in  basil  leaves and reduce heat to low. 
 Simmer until  pasta  of choice is cooked until al dente. 
 This is enough sauce for up to 1½ pounds  pasta . 
 To sweeten any  tomato  sauce, add ½ a minced  onion  with the  garlic  and let it soften and sweeten over medium low heat for 10 minutes before adding to  tomato  products.
