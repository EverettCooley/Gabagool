 Description : 
 Algerian Orange and Onion Salad. Another version of  orange  salad.  orange  salads are clean tasting and help refresh and cleanse the palate especially during multi-course meals.
 I prefer to slice my  onions  much more thinly than shown in the photo. I did not slice these  onions .
 This salad is only as good as the  oranges  and the sweetness of the  onions  used. If the  onions  you have aren't not so sweet soak them in cold  water  for about thirty minutes. A little  sugar  in the  water  helps too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 thinly sliced fresh  fennel 
 blood oranges  ~ sliced 
 wild greens and herbs 
 onions  sliced 
 Directions : 
 Marinading the  onions  in 1 part  vinegar  and 3-4 parts  olive oil  help take the bite out of lesser quality  onions . 
 Variations : 
 Orange  salad variations include: 
 
 thinly sliced fresh  fennel  (I prefer young, tender  fennel  for this) 
 grated  fennel  (I use this method for older  fennel ) 
 blood oranges 
 wild greens and herbs 
 almonds 
 walnuts 
 pine nuts 
 orange flower water  (be careful, if you are not used to this it can smell almost cosmetic) 
 rosewater  (good quality ones actually have a refreshing aroma) 
 olives 
 dates 
 radishes 
 grated  carrots 
 shallots 
 sugar 
 honey  and  cinnamon
