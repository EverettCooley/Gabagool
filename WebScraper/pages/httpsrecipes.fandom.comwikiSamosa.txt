 1½ cups refined  wheat flour 
 3 medium  potatoes 
 ½ cup garden  peas 
 1 cup shredded  cabbage 
 1 cup chopped  onion 
 2 tbs chopped  green chili 
 1½ tsp  ginger  paste 
 ¼ cup  mint  leaves 
 ½ cup  coriander leaves  (dhaniya) 
 3 tsp and separate for deep frying  vegetable oil 
 salt  as per taste 
 Directions : 
 Boil  potatoes , peel and slightly mash. 
 Boil  peas  and  cabbage  and keep aside. 
 In a non stick pan, heat  oil  and add chopped  onions  until light brown. 
 Add  ginger  paste, coriander,  mint , green  chile  and fry for one minute. 
 Now, add  salt  and the boiled  peas ,  cabbage  and mashed  potatoes  and stir well. 
 Let it cook for a minute, remove from heat and keep aside. 
 Mix  flour  and  salt . 
 Melt 3 tablespoons of  butter  and add to the  flour  and  salt  mixture and mix well. 
 Add a few tablespoons of  water  at a time, to the mixture and make into dough. 
 The consistency of the dough is similar to that of chapati. 
 Divide the dough into  walnut  sized balls and flatten each ball to form a circle. 
 The size of each circle is roughly six inches in diameter. 
 Divide the circle into two (half circles). 
 Wet the edges of each half circle. 
 Place sufficient amount of stuffing in the middle of the half circle and fold the corners in, so that, the end result looks like a stuffed triangle. 
 Pinch the edges lightly, they should seal easily because they are wet. 
 In a wide skillet, heat  oil  over medium-low. 
 When  oil  is hot, deep fry the stuffed samosas until they become pale brown in color. 
 Remove from skillet and keep aside. 
 After frying all the samosas to a pale brown color, re-fry them, over medium heat, once again to a deep brown color.
