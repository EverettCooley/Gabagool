Ingredients : 
 2 boxes Streit's or Goodman's  beef   rice  with vermicelli  [1] 
 2 lbs ground meat  [2]

 Directions : 
 Cook meat completely in a fry pan, breaking into small pieces. 
 Add the  rice  and vermicelli (but not the seasoning mix) and fry together for two minutes. 
 Add the 5½ cups of hot  water  and the seasoning mix from  rice  mixes. 
 Simmer on an extremely low heat for 20-30 minutes, until all  water  is absorbed and  rice  is tender. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   You can use Rice-A-Roni if you prefer and are not kosher 
 
 ↑   I use a combo of  ground beef  and  ground turkey
