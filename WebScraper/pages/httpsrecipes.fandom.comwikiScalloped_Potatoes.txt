 Serves 8 
 Ingredients : 
 1 clove  garlic , peeled and crushed 
 2½ pounds firm  boiling potatoes 
 1½ cup grated, imported  Swiss cheese 
 6 tablespoons  butter , cut in ¼ inch bits 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 ⅛ teaspoon coarsely ground  black pepper 
 1¼ cups  milk 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 425°F. 
 Rub the bottom and sides of a flameproof baking and serving dish, 10 to 12 inches across and 2 inches deep, with the crushed garlic, and grease lightly with butter. 
 Peel the potatoes and cut into ⅛ inch slices (about 8 cups). 
 Dry the potato slices with a paper towel, then spread half of the slices in the bottom of the dish. 
 Sprinkle them with half the cheese, butter bits, salt and pepper. 
 Spread the rest of the slices in the dish and sprinkle the remaining cheese, butter, salt and pepper on top. 
 Slowly pour the milk into the side of the dish. 
 Bring to a simmer over low heat, then place in the upper third of the oven; bake for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. 
 At this point, remove any residual liquid with a bulb baster and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are completely tender, the milk absorbed and the top nicely browned. 
 Serve at once.
