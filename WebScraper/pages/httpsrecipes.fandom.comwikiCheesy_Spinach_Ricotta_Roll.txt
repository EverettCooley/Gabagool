 Ingredients : 
 12 ounces fresh  spinach  cooked 
 2 cups  ricotta cheese 
 1 tablespoon fresh  parsley  chopped 
 3  egg whites 
 1 cup  all purpose flour 
 1⅓ cup water 
 ½ cup  Parmesan cheese  finely grated 
 2 cups  marinara sauce 
 olive oil 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 325°F. 
 Season spinach with salt and pepper then set aside. 
 Mix ricotta cheese with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley then set aside. 
 Mix together egg whites, flour and water then beat with a wire whisk to get rid of lumps. 
 Lightly coat a crepe pan with olive oil and heat to medium then ladle 2½ tablespoons batter into heated pan. 
 Crepe batter should lightly cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. 
 Tilt pan to cover evenly. 
 When edges of crepe turn lacy and brown and crepe is cooked through remove crepe and stack on a plate. 
 Continue until all batter is used. 
 When the crepes are cooked assemble the rolls by spooning 2 rounded tablespoons of ricotta cheese mixture and 1 tablespoon spinach mixture. 
 Fold each crepe to seal in mixture. 
 Place rolled crepes in a greased rectangular casserole dish. 
 When pan is full spoon marinara sauce over crepes and bake at 325 for 20 minutes. 
 Serve with Parmesan cheese.
