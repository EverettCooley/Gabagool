 About Grand Marnier : 
 Grand Marnier  (pronounced [gʀɑ̃maʀnje]) is a liqueur created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is made from a blend of true  cognacs  and distilled essence of bitter  orange . Grand Marnier is 40% alcohol (80 proof). It is produced in several varieties, most of which can be consumed "neat" as a digestif and can be used in mixed drinks and desserts. In France this kind of use is the most popular especially with Crêpes Suzette and "crêpes au Grand Marnier".
