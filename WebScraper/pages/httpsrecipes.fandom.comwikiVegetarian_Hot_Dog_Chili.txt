 Description : 
 This chili is of a more sauce-like consistancy, making it perfect as a vegie sausage or baked potato topping, but nothing stops me from eating it with a spoon!
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 16 oz cans red kidney beans, liquid drained and reserved 
 One pkg. Yves brand turkey crumbles 
 One large red onion, diced 
 Half a head of garlic, peeled and diced 
 One large bell pepper, coarsley chopped 
 1 jar of your favorite salsa 
 3/4 cup your favorite smokey barbecue sauce 
 Directions : 
 In a dutch oven, saute the red onion, garlic, and bell pepper over medium heat 3-4 minutes. The bell pepper should still be crunchy. 
 Add the Yves brand turkey crumbles and cook about 1 minute until browned. 
 Add the beans and salsa and stir. Add the barbecue sauce a little at a time to your own liking. 
 Pepper to taste, and simmer over medium-low heat ten minutes, stirring frequently. Should the chili simmer off too much, add some of the reserved canning liquid. 
 Salt to taste, remove from heat, and serve.
