Description : 
 
 Kimchi Jun (aka Kimchijeon or kimchi jeon (IPA: [kimtɕʰi dʑʌn]) ) is a variety of jun (aka jeon), or Korean pancake-like dish, made with sliced  kimchi ,  flour  batter and sometimes any other available  vegetables . Kimchi, pickled vegetables seasoned with  chili pepper  and  jeotgal , are a staple in  Korean cuisine . The dish is good for using up ripened kimchi along with Kimchi Bokkeumbap (kimchi fried rice).
 It is served as an  appetizer ,  snack  or  banchan  (side dish).
 When making Kimchi Jun, the  brine  from the kimchi, especially that of baechu kimchi (made from  Napa cabbage ), is usually added in. So while the pancake is red, it's not spicy itself. With kimchi, it is served as  anju  (a side dish to go with alcoholic drinks) especially with  makgeolli  or  dongdongju .
