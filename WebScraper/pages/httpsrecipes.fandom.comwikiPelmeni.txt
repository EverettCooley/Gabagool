 1 pound ground  beef 
 1 medium  onion , minced 
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh or 1 tsp. dried  dill 
 salt ,  pepper 
 Pelmeni/Vareniki dough 
 White of 1 small  egg , beaten

 1/2 cup  butter 
 Directions : 
 Mix ground beef, onion, dill, salt and pepper to taste, and enough water or broth (about 1 cup) to make a soft mixture. 
 Roll out Pelmeni/Vareniki dough, 3 or 4 at a time, to 3-inch circles. 
 Place 1-tablespoon filling on each dough round. 
 Brush edges with water. Fold to form half moons, pinch opposite ends to one another to seal. 
 Repeat with remaining balls of dough. 
 Brush pelmeni with beaten egg white. 
 Bring large pot full of salted water to a boil. 
 Without crowding, drop pelmeni into boiling water, stirring to prevent sticking, until the pelmeni come to the surface, about 4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. 
 Melt butter over medium heat and drizzle over pelmeni. Or serve pelmeni with sour cream. 
 
Makes 100 pelmeni.
