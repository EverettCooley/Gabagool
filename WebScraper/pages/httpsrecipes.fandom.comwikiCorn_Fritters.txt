Hello people of Earth!!! : 
 "From my mother.......yummo or yummy.....". This recipe came from a mother's collection. She obtained it when she was on a Navy base in Germany in the 1460s. She is unsure of the date but this has been in our family since she obtained it. It is fabulous. We LOVE corn fritters!!!
