Ingredients : 
 4  eggs 
 2 tablespoons semi-skimmed  milk 
 ½ salad bag or 110 g  salad 
 grated  cheese 
 3 pinches ground  pepper 
 1 pinch  salt 
 "1 Cal" oil spray

 Scramble the eggs in a bowl. 
 Add the milk, pepper and salt to the bowl. 
 Spray the oil 3 times into a frying pan, place it on the hob and turn on the heat to maximum. 
 Add the salad to the frying pan and stir for 2 minutes. 
 Once the salad becomes wet in texture (don't touch it, just look), pour the bowl's mixture into the pan. 
 Cook until the eggs settle (around ⅘ minutes) then add grated cheese on top. 
 Leave for a further ⅔ minutes and then place the frying pan under the grill. 
 Switch the grill to maximum and leave until fully cooked or golden brown (depending on taste). 
 Serve with more salad or carbs of your choice.
