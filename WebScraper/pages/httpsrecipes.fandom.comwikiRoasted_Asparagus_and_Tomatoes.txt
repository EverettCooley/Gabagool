Description : 
 I found this recipe in an old magazine that was just laying around on my coffee table and it looked good so I decided to make it for Easter. What an absolutely awesome dish! Even the  asparagus  haters loved it. This recipe can be prepared ahead of time and reheated or served at room temperature.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons  balsamic vinegar 
 1 teaspoon dried  thyme  leaves 
 1  garlic  clove, minced 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 ½ teaspoon  black pepper 
 ¼ teaspoon  brown sugar 
 2 cups  grape tomatoes   or   cherry tomatoes 
 2 bunches  asparagus 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 300 °F. 
 Whisk together the  olive oil ,  balsamic vinegar ,  thyme ,  garlic ,  salt ,  pepper  and  brown sugar . 
 Cut the  tomatoes  in half and toss to combine with the  olive oil  mixture. 
 Spread the  tomatoes  in a roasting pan and place in the oven. 
 Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until the  tomatoes  are shrivelled. 
 Break the ends from the  asparagus  at their natural breaking point. 
 Add the tender lengths of  asparagus  to the  tomatoes  and continue to cook for 25 minutes or until the  asparagus  is tender.
