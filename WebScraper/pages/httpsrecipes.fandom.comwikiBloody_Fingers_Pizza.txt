 Ingredients : 
 1  red bell pepper 
 12  mozzarella  sticks 
 8 small baked pizza crusts 
 1 cup  pizza sauce 
 Directions : 
 Remove core, stem and seed from  pepper . Cut  pepper  lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips, then cut crosswise into ½-inch pieces—they’ll be the fingernails. Round corners on one end of  pepper . 
 Cut  mozzarella  sticks in half, crosswise – they’ll be the fingers. Round corners on one end of sticks and also cut out a ½-inch square notch—you’ll put the  pepper  fingernails here. 
 Place pizza crusts on baking sheet. Spread pizza sauce over each crust. 
 Place 3  cheese  fingers on each crust and fit a  red pepper  fingernail onto each  cheese  finger.
