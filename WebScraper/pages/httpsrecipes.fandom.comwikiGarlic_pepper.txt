Unlike  garlic salt  or  garlic powder ,  garlic pepper  can feature a variety of ingredients. The simplest garlic pepper is a combination of ground  black pepper  and finely ground dried  garlic . Many like this type as a great substitute for  salt , because you get the wonderful seasoning of pepper added to the spiciness of garlic.
