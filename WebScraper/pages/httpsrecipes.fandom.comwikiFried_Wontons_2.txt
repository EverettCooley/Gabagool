 Description : 
 Yields about 48 wontons
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 dried black  Mushrooms 
1 leaf  bok choy 
1  green onion 
1 slice  ginger 
1/2 pound ground  Pork 
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce 
1 teaspoon  sesame oil 
1 teaspoon  granulated sugar 
Pinch of  salt 
1  egg , lightly beaten 
3 cups  oil  for deep-frying, or as needed 
48 wonton wrappers, or as needed 
 water , as needed
 
 
 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Wipe any dirt off the  Mushrooms . Soak in warm  water  until softened (20 to 30 minutes). Squeeze out the excess  water  and chop. Wash and shred the  bok choy  leaf. Wash and dice the  green onion . Mince the  ginger  until you have 1/2 teaspoon.
 In a medium bowl, combine the ground  Pork  with the dark soy sauce,  sesame oil ,  Sugar  and  salt .
 Add the lightly beaten  egg  and the vegetables. This is the wonton filling.
 Heat the  oil  to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. While the  oil  is heating, prepare the wontons. Lay a wonton wrapper in front of you. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the middle. Fold up the wonton so that it resembles a nurse's cap, wetting the edges to seal (if you haven't made wontons before, see photo instructions on filling wontons).
 Add the won tons to the hot  oil , a few at a time, sliding them in 
carefully. Deep-fry the wontons in batches until they are golden brown, turning to make sure they brown evenly. Drain on paper towels or a tempura rack if you have one. As with  egg  rolls, wontons should be served as soon as possible, to ensure they remain crispy. Serve with Sweet and Sour Sauce or red  rice wine vinegar .
