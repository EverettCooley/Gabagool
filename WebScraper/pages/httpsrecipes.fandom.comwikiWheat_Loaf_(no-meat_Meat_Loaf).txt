Description : 
 This recipe came from a vegetarian cooking class I took.It makes a great substitute for meat loaf!It is NOT low fat but,it is VERY good!It makes great sandwiches the day after too.Just slice and put on some whole  Wheat  bread with a little extra  ketchup .YUMMY! 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup finley ground raw not toasted  walnuts  (I use my blender to do this) 
 1 cup  wheat germ  (also raw) 
 1 cup grated mild  Cheddar   Cheese 
 3/4 cup  tomato juice 
 2  eggs , well beaten 
 1 large  Onion , finley chopped 
 1 teaspoon  thyme 
 1/4 teaspoon  marjoram 
 1/2 teaspoon  oregano 
 1/2 teaspoon  basil 
 salt  and  pepper 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
 Mix together the  nuts , wheat germ  and  Cheese . 
 Add remaining ingredients and mix well. 
 Turn all of the mixture into a WELL oiled loaf pan. 
 Bake for 45 minutes. 
 I glaze this with  ketchup  (fruit sweetened) about the last 5 minutes of baking. 
 I also let this sit in the loaf pan for 5â€“10 minutes to firm up a little before removing. 
 Serve like"meat loaf" with your favorite sides!
