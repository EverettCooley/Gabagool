Description : 
 Sweet rice pudding, Puerto Rican-style
 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups  water 
 1 teaspoonful  salt 
 1 teaspoonful  cloves 
 1 tablespoonful crushed  fresh ginger 
 1 x 14-oz can  coconut cream  such as  Coco López 
 1 cup regular, uncooked,  short-grain rice 
 1 cup  sugar 
 1 tablespoonful cooking  oil  (optional) 
 ½ cup  raisins 
 Directions : 
 For best results, soak  rice  in  water  for about two hours prior to cooking. Drain. 
 Add the  salt , cloves and  ginger  to three cups of  water  in a deep sauce pan. Bring to a boil. 
 Sieve through a colander to remove the remnants of the spices. Bring to a boil once again. 
 Add the  coconut cream ,  rice ,  sugar  and  oil . 
 Cook covered over medium-low heat for about twenty minutes. 
 Add the  raisins  and blend in. 
 Continue to cook, uncovered, until the  rice  has absorbed all the  water  (about fifteen more minutes). 
 Cooking times vary depending on your climate and elevation from sea level. Don't worry: this recipe is very forgiving of cooking lapses. Just don't overcook! 
 Pour into a square or rectangular dish about one inch high and allow to cool. 
 Sprinkle ground  cinnamon  or  cinnamon sugar  on the pudding and cut in two-inch squares for your diners. 
 It is equally enjoyable after refrigeration. 
 It will keep for several days, well covered in the refrigerator.
