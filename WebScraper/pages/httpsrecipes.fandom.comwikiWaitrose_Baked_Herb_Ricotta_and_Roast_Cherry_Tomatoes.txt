Description : 
       Baked Herb Ricotta and Roast Cherry Tomatoes     
 This is really brunch, masquerading as a light supper. The recipe can easily be doubled to serve four generously – just spoon the ricotta mixture into a small loaf tin instead of individual moulds and bake for ten minutes longer. A small avocado and rocket salad makes an ideal accompaniment.
 
 Preparation time : 10 minutes 
 Cooking time : 20 minutes to 25 minutes 
 Total time : 30 minutes to 35 minutes 
 Serves: 2 
 Ingredients : 
 2 slices wholemeal or  sourdough bread 
 150 g  cherry tomatoes , halved 
 2 tbsp extra virgin  olive oil 
 250 g  ricotta cheese , drained 
 2 tbsp  Grana Padano  cheese, finely grated 
 1  egg 
 1 tbsp  basil  leaves, torn 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 190°C / gas 5. Spread the tomatoes out, cut sides up, in a small roasting tin and season well. 
 Use a little of the oil to grease two 180ml pudding moulds or ovenproof cups and drizzle 1 – 2 tsp over the tomatoes. 
 Beat the cheeses, egg and half the basil together with a little seasoning in a bowl and divide between the moulds. 
 Bake the Ricotta mixture and the tomatoes for 20 – 25 minutes, until the cheese is puffed up and beginning to brown. Run a knife around the edge and turn out of the moulds. 
 Toast the bread and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Top with slices of the baked Ricotta; season with black pepper 
 Drinks recommendation : 
 This recipe needs a wine that will balance its acidity, with a complexity able to cope with the textures. This Italian example has delicacy and a lovely finish. Sant’Elisa Friulano 2008 Friuli Grave DOC. Bin 600870.
