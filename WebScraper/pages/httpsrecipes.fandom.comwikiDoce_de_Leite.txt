 Description : 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 gallon of  milk 
 2 cups of  Sugar 
 fresh juice of 2-3  limes 
 about 8 whole cloves 
 
 
 Directions : 
 Pour  milk  into large saucepan, add the two cups of  Sugar  and cook over low flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the  milk  boils. 
 When it starts to boil, pour in the  lime juice . 
 The  milk  will curdle almost instantaneously and you should use the spoon to break large curds into smaller ones. 
 Add the cloves and let the mixture simmer slowly, until you have very little liquid left and the curds turn a golden color. 
 Let cool and refrigerate. 
 Serve it in a beautiful glass bowl!
