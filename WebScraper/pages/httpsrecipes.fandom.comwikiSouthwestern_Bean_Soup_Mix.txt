Soup mixes are a wonderful gift from the kitchen for college students, grandparents, young married couples or anyone that is new to cooking. The following combinations can be placed in jars; 1 cup of beans to each jar with a seasoning packet. 
 Gift Ideas : Line a wicker basket with one or two red bandanas. Place in a jar the beans and the seasoning packet, put on the lid and tie with natural raffia, using a hot glue gun carefully glue several small dried  hot peppers  to the raffia bow, or thread floral wire through the  peppers  and attach to lid. In the basket you can include two bags of  cornbread  mix, a bottle of hot pepper sauce  (I like the brands with fun names), bowls and if you wish, a cast iron cornbread pan.
