APPLE CHERRY GUMDROPS
 
   Vegetable oil
  1 cup sugar
  1 cup light corn syrup
  3/4 cup apple-cherry drink
  1 3/4 ounces powdered pectin
  1/2 teaspoon baking soda
  2 drops red food color, if desired
  Sugar
  Line loaf pan, 9 x 5 x 3 inches, with aluminum foil. Brush with
 
 oil. Heat 1 cup sugar and the corn syrup to boiling in 1-1/2 quart
saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is
dissolved. Cook, without stirring, to 280 degrees on candy thermometer
or until small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water
separates into hard but not brittle threads. While cooking sugar
mixture, heat apple-cherry drink, pectin and baking soda to boiling
(this should take 1 to 2 minutes); remove from heat. Stir in food
color. Let stand 2 minutes. Skim off foam. Pour mixture into pan. Let
stand uncovered at room temperature 24 hours. Lift foil from pan and
remove foil from sides. Cut into 3/4-inch squares with knife dipped in
sugar. Roll squares in sugar. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Store gumdrops in airtight container.
