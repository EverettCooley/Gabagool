Description : 
 In the Japanese art of origami, a simple piece of paper can be transformed into a crane, an elephant or even Santa Claus. Equally subtle, stirring a few Japanese ingredients into roughly mashed  California avocado  creates a new taste sensation.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¾ cup shredded  daikon  ( Japanese radish ) 
 ½ tsp.  salt , rock, iodized, or kosher only 
 2  California avocados , about 1 pound 
 ⅓ cup finely sliced  green onion 
 ¼ cup fresh  salmon caviar   [1] 
 2 tbsp.  rice vinegar 
 1 tbsp. Japanese  soy sauce 
 ½ tbsp.  wasabi  paste  [2] 
 Directions : 
 Toss  daikon  with  salt ; just drain in a colander for half an hour. 
 Squeeze out as much liquid as possible; then reserve. 
 Coarsely mash avocados. Fold with the remaining ingredients and reserved  daikon . 
 Guacamole is best made as close to serving as possible. For short-term storage, seal in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole. Use as a dip for chips, cooked meat, poultry, or seafood.
