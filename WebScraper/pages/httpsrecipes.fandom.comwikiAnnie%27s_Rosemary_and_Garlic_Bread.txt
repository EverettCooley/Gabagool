 1 1/2 cup lukewarm  water  (110 degrees)

 Directions : 
 Mix together the  water ,  yeast ,  Sugar  and half of the  rosemary . 
 Add 1 tsp  salt  to the  flour , then add the  flour  and  salt  to the  yeast  mixture, slowly, until the dough is able to form a ball. 
 Knead on a well floured board or table for 10 minutes. 
 Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover, and let sit in a warm place until it doubles in size (about an hour). 
 Mix together the  oil ,  rosemary  and  garlic . 
 Punch dough down, and knead a few times to make it easy to handle. 
 Shape dough into 2 loaves and place several inches apart on a baking sheet. 
 Score the loaves and pour the  oil  mixture on top of them. 
 Sprinkle each loaf with the  kosher salt . Allow to rise for 30 minutes. 
 Pre-heat oven to 350.
