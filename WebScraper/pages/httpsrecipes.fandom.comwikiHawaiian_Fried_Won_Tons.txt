Ingredients : 
 1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (e.g. Spam), chopped 
 1 (8 ounce) can  water   chestnuts , drained and chopped 
 3 tablespoons  green onions , chopped 
 3 tablespoons fresh  parsley , chopped 
 3 hard-cooked  eggs , peeled and chopped 
 1/2 teaspoon  pepper 
 1 1/2 tablespoons oyster sauce 
 1 (14 ounce) package square wonton wrappers 
 1 quart  vegetable oil  for frying 
 Directions : 
 In a medium bowl, mix together the lunchmeat,  water chestnuts ,  green onions ,  parsley , hard-cooked  eggs ,  pepper , and oyster sauce. Set aside. 
 On a clean flat surface, such as a cutting board, lay out 4 to 6 wonton skins at a time. 
 Place a tablespoon of the meat mixture into the center of each one. 
 Keep a small bowl of  water  next to the work area to dip fingers in. Use wet fingers to moisten the corners of each wrapper. Quickly pinch all 4 corners together to seal in the filling. If it doesn't hold, use more  water . 
 Keep filled wontons covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying while the others are made. 
 Heat one inch of  oil  in a deep heavy skillet over medium-high heat, or heat recommended amount of  oil  in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). 
 Fry wontons for a few minutes on each side, or until golden. 
 Remove to paper towels to absorb excess grease.
