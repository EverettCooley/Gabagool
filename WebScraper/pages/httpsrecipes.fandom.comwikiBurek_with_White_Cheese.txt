 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 Burek
 
 1 pkg  dry yeast 
 1/4 c lukewarm  water 
 1/4 tsp  Sugar 
 3 1/3 c all purpose  flour 
 1/2 tsp  salt 
 3/4 c lukewarm  water 
 1/2 melted  butter 
 Filling
 
 9  eggs  (slightly beaten) 
 1/2 lb crumbled  feta   Cheese 
 3 TB melted  butter 
 Directions : 
 Butter a large round pan (15-16 in) and set aside. 
 Prepare  yeast  with 1/4 c lukewarm  water  and 1/4 tsp  Sugar . 
 Set aside. Sift  flour  and  salt  into large bowl, leaving a well in the middle. 
 Add prepared  yeast  mixture into well. Begin mixing by hand and slowly add lukewarm  water . 
 Knead until dough forms a ball of medium consistency (approx 10 minutes). 
 Divide dough into 14 equal parts, roll into round balls, cover and let stand for 1/2 hour. 
 Melt 1/2 lb  butter  in saucepan. 
 Roll out 4 balls into 6 in. circles, stack one on top of the other, brushing each layer with melted  butter  excluding the top layer. 
 Let stand briefly, then roll out on slightly floured table to just a little bit larger than the bottom of your pan. 
 Place in pan and brush top with melted  butter . 
 Mix filling and spread evenly to edge of pan. 
 Now roll out one ball as thinly as you can; sprinkle with  butter  and gather it loosely into folds, and with a slight pull, elongate it. 
 Starting from the center of the pan, place this dough over filling, circling it to look like a pinwheel. 
 Repeat with remaining balls until you have reached the outer edge of your pan. 
 Sprinkle generously with remaining  butter . 
 Cover with a tea towel and set Burek over a pan of very hot  water  for about 20 minutes. 
 Bake in a preheated oven of 300 deg. for about 45 minutes or until nicely browned.
