Sesame brown and wild rice
 3 T unhulled sesame seeds
1/2 C wild rice
1 C brown rice
2-3/4 C water
1 T tamari

 Heat the pressure cooker over medium-high heat and toast the sesame
seeds and wild rice (do not add oil) until the seeds begin to darken
and pop. Add the brown rice and water and put the lid on the cooker.
Bring to pressure and cook for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and allow
to cool naturally until the pressure is down and you can remove the
lid. Remove the lid, stir in the sesame oil and tamari, and fluff
