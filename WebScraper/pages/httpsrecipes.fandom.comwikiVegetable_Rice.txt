 Description : 
 I'm really fussy about  rice . For all my life it's been such a staple part of my diet that I cannot bear to eat  rice  unless it's done perfectly the way I like it. I guess you could call me a "rice-snob" - because I turn my nose up (and will refuse to eat)  rice  served in any office canteen or bistro or restaurant (except Indian or Chinese) because I know that it will be simply awful. I have also noticed that some Indian restaurants in UK are really bad with the quality oftheir  rice  preparation - I guess it's because they think they can get away with it without anyone noticing.
 rice  cooked Indian-style is often the main bit of carbohydrate accompaniment to a "saucy" vegetable or meat dish. You could treat the following instructions as a kind of Delia Smith-style teach-in on how to cook the perfect bowl of  rice  - but I've had a couple of requests for a treatment on "vegetable  rice " so this is what we will do here. (If you want plain  rice  - then the recipe is exactly the same - but without the  masala  and mixed veg.)
 Vegetable  rice  is sometimes known as "pilau"  rice  - although here in UK - "pilau"  rice  is synonymous with the multicoloured  rice . Calling it "vegetable pilau" is more accurate. Normally when cooking  rice  as an accompaniment to a "saucy" Indian dish - you do plain  rice  - but if you have a "dry" dish (e.g. tandoori  Chicken  or shish-kebab) then instead of doing plain  rice  - do vegetable  rice  to accompany the "dry" (not saucy) meat.
 Now - I don't have any purpose-taken pictures of the cooking method for vegetable  rice  - so I am using pictures from my archive that as much as possible - assembling them in such a way that accurately reflects the different steps in the method. Amazingly - there is only one step that I don't have a picture of - so I will use words instead of picture there.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 large (or 2 small)  onions 
 1 cup of  basmati rice  (serves two people) 
 1 generous pinch of  jeera  ( cumin ) seeds 
 3 teaspoons of  garam masala 
 1 tablespoon of  vegetable oil  (e.g. sunflower) 
 1 generous handful of frozen mixed veg 
 And yes - I said i was a rice-snob: ONLY  basmati rice  WILL DO. Do not use any other form of  rice  - e.g. American Long  grain , hippy wild- rice  or that yukky  brown rice  or Uncle Ben's, Uncle Tom's and other old cobbly. Use only  basmati rice  from India or Pakistan or China. Tilda is a popular brand that you can find in the "world food" aisle at your local supermarket.
 The froxen mixed veg should be the type that you find already prepared for you in bags in the supermarket freezer compartments. The one I reccomend is the one with small baby  carrots ,  Peas ,  Sweetcorn , green-beans and maybe chunks of green and red pepper. You might not find bags with all of the above in them - so it doesn't matter if (say) the bag doesn't contain  pepper  or  green beans . Just make sure you DON'T get the mixed veg where the  Sweetcorn  are the "baby  Sweetcorn  cobs" and DON'T get ones with "broad beans" or "chopped  carrot ". If it has  Sweetcorn  in it - make sure it's the juicy  Sweetcorn  kernels, if it has beans in it - make sure it's  green beans  (long, thin dark-green stalky things) and if it's got  carrot  in it - make sure it's whole baby  carrots . Also - the  Peas  should be  Peas  - not "mange-tout".
 
 Directions : 
 Make sure the  rice  is washed of all "starch" throughly. We do this by pouring the  rice  into a sieve and placing the sieve into a bowl and placing the bowl in the sink with the cold  water  tap pouring into it. We let the  water  run (be careful not to have powerful jet - as this is wasteful of  water ) for a few mins - and then let the  rice  drain by balancing the sieve on top of the small cup that you used to measure the  rice  in the first place:
 
       Rice being washed inside sieve inside bowl inside sink     
       Rice being drained over the measuring cup     
 
 
         Chop the onions coarsely     
         Heat oil and fry the jeera seeds untill popping     
 
 
         Fry the onion untill they are translucentish     
 
 
 
         Add rice     
         Add the water then cover and simmer     
 
 
         Prepare low-flame burner     
         Make sure it's on a really LOW flame!
