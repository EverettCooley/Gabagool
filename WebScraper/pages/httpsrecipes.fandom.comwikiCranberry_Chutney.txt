 Description : 
 cranberry  Chutney 
 East meets West in this unique blend of  cranberries  with other fruits. Makes a nice change of pace from the traditional  cranberry sauce  at Thanksgiving. Great as a sandwich spread with  cream cheese  too :)
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  water 
 1 cup  sugar 
 12 ounces  cranberries , fresh or frozen 
 ½ cup  vinegar 
 1 cup  raisins 
 ½ cup peeled diced  apples 
 ¼ teaspoon  allspice 
 ¼ teaspoon  ground ginger 
 ¼ teaspoon  cinnamon 
 ⅛ teaspoon ground  cloves 
 ½ cup chopped  walnuts  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Bring  water  and  sugar  to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
 Add remaining ingredients; return to a boil. 
 Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes or until  apples  are tender. 
 Pour into a glass mixing bowl (acid foods can react with metal bowls). 
 Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on chutney. 
 Cool to room temperature; then refrigerate overnight, covered with plastic wrap, so flavors blend. 
 Serve at room temperature. 
 Use as an accompaniment to meats such as  turkey  or use as a sandwich spread with  bagels  plain or with a layer of  cream cheese .
