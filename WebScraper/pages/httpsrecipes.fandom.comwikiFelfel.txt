Description : 
 Algerian hot peppers stuffed with nuts

 10 â€“ 12 hot  green peppers  (you can use mild) 
 1 cup  walnuts  and  pine nuts  combined 
 1 clove of  garlic 
 2  chive  stalks 
 salt 
 olive oil 
 1 tablespoon of  lemon juice  or  vinegar 
 Directions : 
 Cook the  peppers  on gentle heat, some of the stuffing will fall out and the  nuts  can burn if you don't mind your heat.
