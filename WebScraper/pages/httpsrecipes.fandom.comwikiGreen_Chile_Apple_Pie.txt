 Ingredients : 
 Crust : 
 4 tablespoons  lard 
 2 cups  all-purpose flour , plus more for dusting 
 1 cup ice  water 
 1 tablespoon  granulated sugar 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 Filling : 
 6 to 7  apples  (such as Granny Smith, Fuji and/or Gala), peeled and sliced (about 6 cups) 
 1/2 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1/2 cup  turbinado sugar , plus more for sprinkling 
 2 tablespoons ground  cinnamon 
 1/2 teaspoon  ground ginger 
 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated  nutmeg 
 1/4 cup fresh  lemon juice  (from about 2 lemons) 
 1/4 cup canned or frozen chopped hot  green chiles  (thawed if frozen) 
 1/4 cup  piñon  nuts ( pine nuts ) 
 1 large  egg 
 Directions : 
 Crust : 
 Cut the  lard  into 1/2-inch cubes; transfer to a plate and freeze at least 1 hour 
 Combine the  flour ,  granulated sugar ,  salt  and  baking powder  in a large bowl 
 Cut in the  lard  with 2 knives until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of  lard 
 A little at a time, stir in 1/2 to 1 cup ice  water  until the dough holds together when squeezed 
 Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form each half into a disk 
 Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight 
 Filling : 
 Combine the  apples ,  flour ,  turbinado sugar ,  cinnamon ,  ginger ,  nutmeg ,  lemon juice ,  green chiles  and  pine nuts  in a large bowl and toss 
 Let sit 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F 
 Prepare : 
 Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface 
 Ease into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate, then spoon the filling into the crust 
 Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round; lay the dough over the filling 
 Press the 2 crusts together around the edge, then fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers 
 Cut a few slits in the top crust or prick with a fork to let steam escape 
 Whisk the  egg  with 1/4 cup  water  and brush over the top crust. Sprinkle with  turbinado sugar . 
 Bake : 
 Bake, rotating the pie every 20 minutes, until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 hours 
 Transfer to a rack and let cool completely
