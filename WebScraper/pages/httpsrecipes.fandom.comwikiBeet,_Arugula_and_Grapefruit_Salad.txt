Description : 
 Arien's post reminded me of a salad I had that a friend made and brought in to lunch one day, consisting of cold sliced beets,  arugula  and  grapefruit  slices. This is a delicious combination!
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 each  grapefruit 
 1 each  arugula  bunch 
 1 can cold sliced  beets  (canned, boiled or steamed would do) 
 Directions : 
 Combine ingredients. 
 Enjoy!
