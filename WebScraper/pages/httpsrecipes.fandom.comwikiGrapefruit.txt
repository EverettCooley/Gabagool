 About Grapefruit : 
 The grapefruit is a sub-tropical citrus tree grown for its fruit, which are as well known as grapefruit. The leaves are dark green, long and thin. It produces white four-petalled flowers. The fruit is yellow-skinned, largely oblate and ranges in diameter from 10-15 cm and has an acidic yellow segmented pulp. The fruit has only become popular from the late 19th century; before that it was only grown as an ornamental plant. The US quickly became a major producer of the fruit, with orchards in Florida and Texas. In Spanish the fruit is known as toronja or pomelo. Grapefruit is a large round yellow citrus with acid juicy flesh which can be eaten raw and is used in salads, drinks but almost all the time is the perfect fruit for a diet. Around the world are various types of grapefruit like white grapefruit, red grapefruits which is sweeter than white one, pummelo and minneola which is a crossing between a tangarine and a grapefruit. The fruit ranges from small- to medium-sized and its skin can be pitted or smooth.
