       Quick Cassoulet     
 Vive la France! Real bistro cooking - quick and tasty. This one comes from the Canadian Bean Council via Vicki Gabereau's CBC radio program. (On occasion, I have been known to double both the wine and the beans ... heck, I ALWAYS do it!)
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 4 skinless boneless  chicken breast  halves 
 ½ lb hot  Italian sausage , cut in ½ inch slices 
 3 medium  carrots , sliced thinly 
 1 medium  onion , sliced thinly 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ½ cup dry  red wine   [1] 
 1  bay leaf 
 1 teaspoon dried  thyme 
 ¼ teaspoon  pepper 
 1 (14 ounces) can  pork and beans  in  tomato sauce 
 chopped  parsley 
 Directions : 
 In a large, lidded stovetop casserole, heat the  oil  over medium-high heat. 
 Brown the  chicken , and remove. 
 Brown the  sausage . 
 Add the  chicken ,  carrots ,  onion  and  garlic  and saute for 2 additional minutes. 
 Drain off the fat. 
 Stir in the wine,  bay leaf ,  thyme  and  pepper . 
 Cover and simmer over low heat for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the  chicken  is no longer pink. 
 Stir in the beans and heat through.

 Note : 
 
 ↑   Instead of dry  red wine , you can substitute ½ cup of  chicken broth  and 1 tbsp of  red wine vinegar .
