Description : 
       Joulukinkku     
 Christmas ham. Joulukinkku is the star of the Finnish Christmas meal. Its preparation is time consuming, but the results are well worth the trouble. No other  Ham  in the world tastes quite as good as the Finnish joulukinkku, prepared as directed here. For busy people, baking a  Ham  in foil will do just fine, but it just doesn't quite taste the same . . .
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 raw shank-in  ham , 4 – 6 kg (9 – 13 lbs) 
 3 tbsp  salt 
 2 tbsp  sugar 
 5 l (1.1 gallon)  water 
 ½ l (2 cups) course  salt 
 250 g (2 cups)  sugar 
 water 
 rye flour 
 1 tbsp  mustard 
 3 tbsp  bread crumbs 
 1 tbsp  sugar 
 Directions : 
 Rub the shank with the  salt  and  sugar . 
 Bring to boil the  water ,  salt  and  sugar . 
 Skim off foam and let cool. 
 Place the shank in the brine and leave to marinate for 2 weeks. 
 When the  ham  is to be cooked, cover it with paste made of  water  and  rye flour . 
 Place in a shallow baking dish with  water  on the bottom so that the bottom of the  ham  will not burn. 
 Bake in a hot oven, 250°C (450°F), for 3 hours. 
 Remove the  rye  crust. 
 Baste the  ham  with  mustard /breadcrumb/ sugar  mixture and quickly brown. 
 Store the  ham  under the  rye  crust. 
 The  ham  can also be baked covered with foil, but the  rye  paste adds a very special flavor and "maturity" to the taste.
