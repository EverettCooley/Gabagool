 Description : 
 Got a hot frying pan for cooking? This classic, crispy pork dish is made and infused with real herbs, salt, and peppercorns from the boiling water and cooked to divine, golden-brown perfection and keeps a steamy, robust aroma with the meat then including the fat. With crunchy skin and super-moist meat, every morsel is pork heaven!
 
         
 Ingredients : 
 4 - 5 pounds whole pork belly 
 1 head garlic, pounded 
 2 tablespoons salt 
 1 tablespoon peppercorns 
 2 bay leaves 
 3 cups water, cold or lukewarm only 
 cooking oil 
 Directions : 
 In a pot over medium heat, combine pork belly, garlic, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. 
 Lower heat, cover, and continue to cook for about 1 to 1 ½ hour or until meat is just tender but not falling apart. 
 Drain pork from liquid, discarding liquid. Wipe the pork dry, quickly removing any stray aromatics. 
 Place on a rack and refrigerate overnight to completely cool and dry. 
 In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough oil to completely cover meat to about 350° F to 375° F. Carefully place meat into oil and fry until meat is golden and skin is crisp and puffed. 
 While the meat is frying, regularly sprinkle about 1 tablespoon cold/lukewarm water onto the meat and hot oil every 5 minutes or so. 
 Remove meat from the pot and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. 
 Let rest for about 5 minutes and then cut into serving pieces with the butcher knife or the cleaver. Serve hot and plain with  lechon  sauce or a dip of choice, or with other main dishes. 
 Tips : 
 To use a conventional method of boiling pork before frying, add 3 cups of water and salt to a large cooking pot.
