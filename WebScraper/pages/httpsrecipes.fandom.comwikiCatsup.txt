 About ketchup : 
 Ketchup  is a condiment, usually made from tomatoes. The ingredients in a typical modern ketchup are tomato concentrate, spirit vinegar, corn syrup or other sugar, salt, spice and herb extracts (including celery), spice and garlic powder. Allspice, cloves, cinnamon, onion, and other vegetables may be included.
 Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular[citation needed] early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, lobster, walnut, kidney bean, cucumber, cranberry, lemon, celery and grape. Mushroom ketchup is still available in some countries, such as the UK, and banana ketchup is popular in the Philippines.
 Ketchup is often used with french fries (chips), hot dogs, hamburgers, sandwiches and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is also used as a base for various sauces.
 Ketchup is also known as tomato ketchup, tomato sauce, red sauce, Tommy sauce, Tommy K, or (in Australian rhyming slang) "dead horse" (for red sauce).
