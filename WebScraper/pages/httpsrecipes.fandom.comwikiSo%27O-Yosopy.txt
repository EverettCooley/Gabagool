Description : 
 Beef soup. Superstition has it that if anyone who does not enjoy cooking is present in the kitchen they may cause the So'O-Yosopy to seperate and spoil the dish! Served with a baked  sweet potato  or a thick slice of broiled  yucca  ( cassava ), or both, and  Sopa Paraguaya , Paraguayan  corn bread  despite its misleading name. Sprinkle, if liked, with grated  cheese .
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 pounds ground lean  sirloin  or  round steak 
 2 tablespoons  vegetable oil 
 2 medium  onions , finely chopped 
 1  green bell pepper , seeded and finely chopped  or  1 or 2 fresh  hot peppers , seeded and chopped 
 4 medium  tomatoes , peeled and chopped 
 Â½ cup  rice  or  vermicelli 
 salt 
 grated  Parmesan cheese 
 Directions : 
 Have the butcher grind the meat twice, then mash it in a mortar to make sure it is completely pulverized or use a food processor. 
 Set the meat aside together with any juices. 
 Heat the  oil  in a skillet and saute the  onions  and  pepper  until the  onions  are softened. 
 Add the  tomatoes  and cook until the mixture is thick and well blended, about 5 minutes longer. 
 Cool the mixture slightly. 
 Put the  beef  and its juices into a saucepan. 
 Stir in the sauteed  onions ,  pepper , and  tomatoes , known as the sofrito, and 8 cups cold  water . 
 Mix well. 
 Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring with a wooden spoon. 
 Add the  rice  or noodles and simmer, still stirring, until tender, about 15 minutes. 
 At this point, season to taste with  salt . 
 If  salt  is added earlier the meat and the liquid, which should be completely blended, may separate.
