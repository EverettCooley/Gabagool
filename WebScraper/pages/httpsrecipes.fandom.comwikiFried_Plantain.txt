Description : 
 This is a traditional West African snack that can also be served as a vegetable. The idea of frying  plantains  has crossed the Atlantic and the practice can be found in virtually all parts of the Caribbean. Methods differ slightly. In Spanish-speaking islands the  plantains  are sometimes flattened and fried and called tostones, while in Haiti they are known as  banana  pesé and usually accompany griots de porc. They are sprinkled with  Sugar  and served as dessert in Guadeloupe and are the traditional accompaniment to Cuba’s picadillo. In still other islands they are fried crisp and eaten as snacks or hors d’oeuvres. This is a basic recipe that individual cooks can adapt to their own methods.
 
 Ingredients : 
 3 large ripe  plantains 
 oil  for frying 
 plantains  have black skins when ripe. 
 Directions : 
 Peel and slice the  plantains . Depending on the desired result, the  plantains  can be sliced into thin rounds, cut into coarse dice, or cut lengthwise in strips. While the  plantains  are being cut up, heat the  oil  to 350 - 375 °F in a heavy skillet. 
 When the  oil  is hot, add the  plantain  pieces a few at a time. Cook until the edges are brown and crispy. Turn and cook on the other side. Remove and drain on absorbent paper. Cook the remainder of the  plantains  in the same manner. 
 Serve warm. Depending on whether you wish your  plantains  to be snack, an accompaniment to vegetables, or a dessert, you may sprinkle them with  salt ,  chile powder , or  powdered sugar .
