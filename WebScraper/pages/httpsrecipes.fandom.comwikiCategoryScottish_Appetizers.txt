 There is quite a large variety of Scottish appetizers and they include Scotch smoked salmon; Finnan haddie, a blend of smoked haddock served in a traditional Vidalia onion cream sauce; or haddie-stuffed artichokes, whole chokes stuffed with smoked haddock, rolled in panko and lightly fried. For all these appetizers most of the ingredients remain the same, the basic ones in Scottish cuisine: flour, fish, butter or spices. These appetizers are served before any meal and some of them are a bit spicy because of the pepper and other condiments that will give them a specific flavor preparing the way for the real treat. The traditional Scottish grannyâ€™s cake is a spicy appetizer which is usually served warm. The variety of Scottish recipes provides many cooking options.
