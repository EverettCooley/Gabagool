Ingredients : 
 2 quarts of firm large  strawberries 
 2 (12 ounce) bags  semi-sweet chocolate  chips 
 2 (6 ounce) boxes  white chocolate  or  almond bark 
 Directions : 
 Wash  strawberries  and dry well with a paper towel. 
 Prepare a large baking sheet by lining with waxed paper. 
 In a medium sized, microwave-safe bowl, break up  white chocolate  into small pieces and melt, on medium power (my microwave i used 60% power) for approximately 4 – 6 minutes, checking and stirring every 2 minutes or so (we don't want the  chocolate  to burn). 
 Remove from microwave and dip  strawberries  one at a time, holding each berry by the stem/leaves, and dipping right up to the base of the stem/leaves. 
 Place on baking sheet/waxed paper and repeat for all  strawberries . 
 Place sheet in refrigerator til  white chocolate  sets, about 15 – 20 minutes. 
 In another medium sized bowl, melt  chocolate chips , using same time frame and power level as above (60%, 4 – 6 minutes). 
 Grasp  strawberries  by stems again, dipping one side into the  chocolate , then the other side, so that the brown  chocolate  makes a "v" shape visible from the front of the  strawberry . 
 Now, with a toothpick, "paint" on 2 or 3 buttons and a bow tie at the top of the berry (near the stem) with the brown  chocolate . 
 Cool on the baking sheet/waxed paper, in refrigerator, til  chocolate  is set. 
 Strawberries  will last 2 – 3 days in the refrigerator.
