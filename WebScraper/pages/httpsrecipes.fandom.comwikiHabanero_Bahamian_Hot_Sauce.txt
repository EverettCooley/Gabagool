 10  habanero peppers 
 3  tomatoes 
 2  mango 
 1 small  papaya 
 1 cup  vinegar 
 Â½ tsp  salt 
 Directions : 
 Remove seeds from  peppers ,  tomatoes , mangoes and  papaya . 
 Simmer together with remaining ingredients for 1 hour. 
 Cool. 
 Puree in food processor or blender. 
 Flavors mingle and develop when refrigerated for several hours or days before using. 
 Careful! store in a bottle with a drip or drop dispenser. 
 Serve with a small spoon and a warning: this sauce is very hot!. 
 A few drops add lots of flavor and heat!.
