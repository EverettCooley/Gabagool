 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  millet 
 6 cups  water 
 1 cup peeled diced  sweet potatoes  (raw or cooked) 
 1 slice peeled  fresh ginger 
 1  cinnamon  stick 
 4 tablespoons  honey 
 chestnuts  or  walnuts  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Rinse and drain the  millet . 
 Put all ingredients except honey and cooked  sweet potatoes  (if using) in a medium saucepan. 
 Bring to a boil. 
 Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until it forms a porridge- 1 hour or so. 
 If you are using cooked  sweet potatoes , add them at the end and stir until hot- this will yield a chunkier porridge; raw ones cooked for an hour pretty much dissolve. 
 Turn off the heat. 
 Stir in the honey. 
 Ladle into bowls.
