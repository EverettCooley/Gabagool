 Description : 
 Who can resist sticky barbecued spare ribs? These Caribbean style ribs are simmered in a jerk-style sauce. You can buy jars of ground jerk seasoning in most supermarkets. It’s a mix of thyme, cinnamon, coriander, garlic ginger and, of course, chili! If you’re doing these for a barbecue, simmer in the sauce the day before then leave to marinate overnight in the fridge before putting on the barbecue to brown and crisp.
