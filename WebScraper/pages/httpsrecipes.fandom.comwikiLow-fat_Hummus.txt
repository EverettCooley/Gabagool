Description : 
 For a shortcut, start with 2.5 cups of canned beans, drained and rinsed. This is MUCH better if you cook the beans yourself! The  lemon juice  and stock add flavor and lighten the texture. This recipe is also much better if you roast the  garlic . It is easy to do—just put your oven on 375°F or so and put the cloves, WITH THE PEEL STILL ON, in until the peels turn a bit black, about 15 minutes. Let them cool and they peel very easily.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup dried  chickpeas , soaked overnight and drained 
 1  bay leaf 
 5 cups  vegetable stock 
 ¼ cup fresh  lemon juice 
 6  garlic  cloves, oven roasted, and 1 clove, chopped 
 zest of one  lemon 
 ½ teaspoon ground  cumin 
 ½ teaspoon  ground coriander 
 ½ teaspoon freshly ground  black pepper 
 ½ cup minced fresh  parsley 
 salt  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Add  chickpeas ,  bay leaf  and vegetable stock to 2 – 3 quart pot. Bring to boil, lower heat, and simmer covered for 2½ hours, or until tender. 
 After cooking, drain the  chickpeas  of any remaining liquid and reserve the stock. 
 Transfer  chickpeas  to a food processor and purée. 
 Add  lemon juice  and continue to puree. Gradually add some of the reserved bean stock if a creamier texture is desired. 
 Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. 
 Add  salt  to taste and serve a room temperature or chilled.
