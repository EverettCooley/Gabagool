A  baking mix  is a mix of ingredients to which liquid, and sometimes oil, eggs or other ingredients are added to produce baked goods like  muffins ,  biscuits ,  cakes  and  brownies . The earliest baking mixes were made during the Industrial Revolution and proved helpful to those who lacked the time to stay home and carefully prepare food. These were commonly recipes for puddings or gelatin. By the 1890s, Aunt JemimaÂ® developed the pancake baking mix, and other mixes would quickly follow in the 20th century.
