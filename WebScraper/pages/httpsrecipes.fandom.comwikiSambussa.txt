Description : 
 Yields 16 pastries.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  brown lentils 
 ½ tsp  cayenne 
 ½ cup  water 
 1 tsp  cinnamon 
 ½ cup  green bell pepper  diced 
 ¾ cup  onions  finely chopped 
 salt  and ground  black pepper  to taste 
 2  garlic  cloves minced 
 3 tbl  olive oil 
 8 won-ton wrappers 
 2 tsp sweet Hungarian  paprika 
 1  egg yolk  beaten with 1 tbl  water 
 1 tsp fresh  ginger  root grated peeled 
 1 tsp  coriander seed  ground 
 oil  for deep-frying 
 Directions : 
 Rinse the  lentils  and bring them to a boil in the  water . 
 Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. 
 Meanwhile, sauté the  onions  and  garlic  in the  olive oil  until the  onions  are translucent. 
 Add the spices and chopped  green peppers  and simmer, covered, for 3 minutes, stirring often. 
 Remove the pan from the heat. 
 When the  lentils  are tender, combine them with the sautéed vegetables. Season with  salt  and  pepper . 
 Cut the won ton wrappers in half to form rectangles. 
 Place a wrapper vertically on a flat surface and brush it with the beaten  egg  mixture. 
 Put a rounded tablespoon of the filling on the lower end of one of the rectangles. 
 Fold the left bottom corner up and over the filling until it meets the right edge of the wrapper and forms a triangle. Next, flip the filled triangle up and over, folding along its upper edge. Then fold it over to the left on the diagonal. Continue folding until you reach the end of the wrapper and have formed a neat triangular package. 
 Repeat this process with the other won ton wrapper rectangles. 
 Deep-fry each pastry until golden in 2 or 3-inches of  oil  heated to 360 °F. 
 You can keep the fried sambussas in a warm oven until they are all prepared and ready to be served. 
 Sambussas are best eaten hot.
