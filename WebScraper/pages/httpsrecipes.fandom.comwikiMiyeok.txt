 About Wakame : 
 A deep green, edible seaweed popular in Japan and other Asian countries. It's used like a vegetable in soups and simmered dishes, as well as occasionally in salads. The browner versions are more strongly flavored. Wakame is available both in fresh and dried forms in Asian markets.
 Raw wakame is called "nama wakame" which is heavily salted and must be washed several times to get rid of the salt. "Hoshi wakame" is dried wakame. It should be soaked in tepid water for about 20 minutes to rehydrate it.
