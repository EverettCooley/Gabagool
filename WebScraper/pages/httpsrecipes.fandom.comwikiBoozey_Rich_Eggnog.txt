Ingredients : 
 1 quart  milk 
 1  vanilla bean  or 1 tbsp  extract 
 12  egg yolks 
 2 cup  sugar 
 1 cup  dark rum 
 2 cup  bourbon 
 1 cup  cognac  or other  brandy 
 8  egg whites 
 3 tbsp  sugar 
 1 quart  cream 
 freshly grated  nutmeg 
 Directions : 
 Base : 
 In a heavy medium-sized saucepan, barely boil the  milk  with the  vanilla bean , which has been split lengthwise, scraped with the back edge of a knife and added to the milk-seeds, pod, and all (if using  vanilla extract , you"ll add it after eggnog base has cooked). 
 Meanwhile, place a large fine-mesh strainer over a bowl set in a large bowl of  ice . 
 Beat the yolks and  sugar  together in the top of a double boiler, by hand or with electric beaters, until thick and smooth, about 1 minute. 
 Whisk in the hot  vanilla   milk . 
 Cook in the double boiler set over simmering  water , stirring constantly all around the bottom and corners with a rubber or wooden spatula. 
 In time, foam will subside. 
 The eggnog base is done when it coats a wooden spoon without bare spots, 12 to 15 minutes. 
 Immediately pour through strainer, stirring to cool. 
 When cool to the touch, slowly whisk in all liquors (if using  vanilla extract  instead of  vanilla bean , add this now, too). 
 Store eggnog base in refrigerator overnight or up to three days, to ripen. 
 To complete eggnog : 
 At serving, remove  vanilla bean  and pour eggnog base into a large punch bowl. 
 Beat  egg whites  with 3 tablespoons  sugar  to stiff peaks; fold into eggnog mixture. 
 Beat  cream  to stiff peaks and fold it in, too. 
 Let some lumps of the  cream  and  egg  whites float on surface. 
 Sprinkle with  nutmeg . 
 Serve immediately, using a ladle.
