This is a very colourful side dish that I serve with jerk  chicken  or barbecued steaks. I quite often will take this to a pot luck along with several copies of the recipe, as it is always requested. For more of a bite, add a finely chopped jalapeño directly to the salad in addition to the sliced jalapeños on top.
