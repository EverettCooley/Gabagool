Ingredients : 
 3 tbsp  unsweetened cocoa powder 
 ¼ cup  vegetable oil 
 2 very ripe  bananas 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 2 large  eggs 
 1 cup  whole wheat flour 
 ½ cup chopped  nuts 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 350°F. 
 Combine  cocoa ,  oil  and  bananas  in a food processor or blender. 
 Puree until smooth. 
 Combine  sugar ,  eggs ,  flour  and  banana  mixture in a mixing bowl. 
 Beat until blended, then stir in the  nuts . 
 Pour the batter into a lightly oiled 9 x 13 inch baking pan and bake for 15 – 20 minutes or until done. 
 Toothpick inserted into center should come out clean. 
 (my suggestion - line baking pan with waxed paper and spray with non-stick vegetable spray). 
 Cut into 2¼ inch squares when cool.
