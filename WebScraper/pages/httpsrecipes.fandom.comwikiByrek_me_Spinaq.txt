 Description : 
 Spinach Pie
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  oil , preferably  olive oil 
 1½ packets (or about 30) pastry leaves ( filo dough ) 
 1½ pounds  spinach , chopped 
 1 cup diced  feta   cheese 
 ½ cup chopped  green onions 
 2  eggs 
 salt , half teaspoon 
 Directions : 
 Brush the baking pan with some of the  oil , and start laying the pastry leaves inside. 
 First, lay two leaves, sprinkle or brush with  oil , then lay two other leaves, and repeat the procedure until half of the leaves are laid. 
 Make sure that they cover the pan by hanging them about one inch over the edges of the pan. 
 Sprinkle  spinach  with  salt , then mix well by hand. 
 Add the  feta   cheese ,  oil ,  onions ,  eggs  and  salt , and spread this mixture over the already laid pastry leaves. 
 Finish by covering the  spinach  with the rest of the pastry leaves repeating the first-half procedure and then roll the hanging edges of the bottom leaves over the pie (think of a pizza crust), sprinkle top with  oil  and bake moderately at 350°F for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown. 
 Serve hot, accompanied with  buttermilk , or beaten  yogurt , thinned down in cold  water  or with chilled stewed  prunes . 
 Sometimes a green salad adds to the meal!
