 Description : 
 Lamb and white bean soup
 
 Ingredients : 
 Â½ kg  lamb  or meat balls 
 2 cups of dry  white beans 
 1  onion  chopped 
 4 tablespoons  ajvar sauce 
 2 tablespoon of vegetta 
 1 tablespoon  mint  (dried preferably or fresh) 
 2 tablespoon of  paprika 
 mild peppers 
 Directions : 
 Boil  beans  in hot  water  in an uncovered pot (fill pot just over half with hot water). 
 Add lamb or meat balls in (if cooking with beef cooking time will increase). 
 When lamb/meatballs are just over half-way cooked heat a pan up and add onions and cook in butter on a low temperature until golden. 
 When onions are cooked add paprika mix well then poor into the bean pot. 
 Then add your ajvar, vegetta and mint. 
 Cover tightly and cook for 2 hours over low heat, or for 45 minutes (if cooking with meatballs). 
 This should produce a thickened juice about 40 mm or less. 
 Taste your dish and if extra vegetta is needed add to your liking (it taste's like salt). 
 Serve hot also try dipping bread into the juice and add mild peppers 
 It will go down great enjoy!!
