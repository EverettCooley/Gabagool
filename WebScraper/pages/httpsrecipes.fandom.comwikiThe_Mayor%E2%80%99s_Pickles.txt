 Ingredients : 
 Cucumber 
 Dill 
 Vinegar 
 Salt 
 Garlic 
 Sugar 
 Instructions : 
 What kind of cuke should IÂ use?
 We highly recommend using either Persian or Kirby cucumbers. They're both classic and stay nice andÂ crunchy. Use Persian if you're not so into seeds. That's what we used here. They also pack nicely because they're super straight and thin.
 Does the type of vinegar matter?
 Yes, and no.Â We used white vinegar here so the flavor would be clean and it wouldn't discolor the pickle, but you could swap forÂ apple cider vinegar. Stay away fromÂ vinegarsÂ that areÂ too overpowering,Â likeÂ red wine vinegar, sherry, or...gasp...balsamic!
 Can I add other flavors?Â 
 Yes! We kept it simple by adding a fewÂ crushed garlic cloves and fresh dill, but feel free to get creative. Add mustard seeds, whole black peppercorns, crushed red pepper flakes, or even fresh chiles for a kick!Â 
 What jar should I use?
 We loveÂ mason jars for the job, but youÂ could even useÂ an oldÂ (washed)Â pickle jar.Â Just always be sure toÂ use a clean jar with a tight lid.Â 
 How long does it takeÂ to "pickle"?
 We say wait at least 2 hours for the pickling to kick in, but if you can, try to give it 24 hours for max flavor.
 How long will it last?
 These pickles will last for up toÂ a week in your refrigerator, but we doubt you'll have any left at that point ğŸ˜‰.Â
