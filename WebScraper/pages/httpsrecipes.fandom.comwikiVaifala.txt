 Description : 
 A refreshing and light drink, perfect for summer.
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ of a 567 g (20 oz) can of  pineapple  (chunks/slices/crushed) 
 225 g can of  mango  (optional) 
 ½ of a 400 g (14 oz) can of  sweetened condensed milk 
 sugar  (optional) 
 1300 ml (1.3 quarts) water 
 Directions : 
 If you're not using crushed pineapple, then drain and chop the pineapple. Reserve the drained syrup. If you're using any other fruit, drain (reserving syrup) and chop those too. 
 Place the fruit and about half the fruit syrup in large bottle or bowl. 
 Pour in the sweetened condensed milk and water, then mix. 
 Add sugar to taste (I use about 2 tablespoons). 
 Chill well, or if serving immediately, throw in some ice. 
 Before serving, stir well, because the pineapple has a tendency to settle, then pour into a large glass and serve with a spoon (this is a drink that you both drink and eat). 
 Notes : 
 You can add ½-1 teaspoon of vanilla for an extra layer of flavour. 
 Don't make the mistake of using fresh pineapple in this drink, because it quickly sours the milk, and makes for a bitter drink.
