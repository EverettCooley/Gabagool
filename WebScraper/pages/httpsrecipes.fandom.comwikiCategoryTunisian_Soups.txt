 Tunisian soups are typically vegetarian in nature, usually involving tomatoes or beans, however, they may incorporate some sort of meat. Soups usually find themselves being served as appetizers, but it is not uncommon for one to be served as an entree. And as with moth Tunisian dishes, soups are generally heavily seasoned and spiced. Such is the case with a popular Tunisian soup, chorba, a heavily peppered soup.
