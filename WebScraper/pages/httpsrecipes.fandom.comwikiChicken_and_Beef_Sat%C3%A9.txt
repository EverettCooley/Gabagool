 Add  curry  paste and remaining 1 tablespoon  brown sugar ; cook, stirring, until  sugar  dissolves,about 2 minutes. 
 Remove pan from heat and whisk in remaining ¾ cup coconut milk, the  peanuts ,  cilantro , and remaining 2 tablespoons juice (or to taste),for  peanut  dipping sauce. 
 Remove  steak  and  chicken  from marinade (discard marinade) and thread on drained skewers. 
 Preheat grill and lightly  oil  rack. 
 Combine  vinegar  and granulated sugar in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer. 
 Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes, for basting sauce. 
 Grill meat, brushing both sides with basting sauce during last minute of cooking, turning once, until  chicken  is cooked through, about 4 minutes, and steak, turning once, about 2 minutes for medium-rare (discard remaining basting sauce). 
 Arrange skewers on a platter and serve with  peanut  dipping sauce.
