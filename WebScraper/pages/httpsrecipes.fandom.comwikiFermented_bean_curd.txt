 About Fermented bean curd : 
 Fermented bean curd also called sufu, fermented tofu, tofu cheese, bean curd cheese or preserved tofu is a form of processed, preserved tofu used in East Asian cuisine as a condiment made from soybeans. The ingredients typically are soybeans, salt, rice wine and sesame oil or vinegar, and are sold in blocks 2- to 4-cm square by 1 to 2 cm thick soaked in brine with select flavorings.
 There are several varieties of fermented tofu: 
 
 White doufu-ru 
 Red doufu-ru 
 Tsao-doufu ("stinky tofu") 
 Chiang-douf 
 White pickled tofu : 
 The white doufu-ru (pai doufu-ru) is the most fermented tofu and there are numerous versions of it, seasoned with pepper, sesame oil, and spices such as anise and cinnamon or ingredients such as lemon juice or rind, minced ham and dried shrimp. 
 
 Red pickled tofu : 
 Red doufu-ru (hung doufu-ru, nanru, nanyu) is identical in preparation to the white, except that fermented red rice is added to the pickling liquor, imparting a rich red color, thick consistency and different flavor and aroma. 
 
 Tsao-dofu : 
 Tsao-dofu, famous for its strong odor, includes: chu-tsao, which is in rice wine and wine lees, and the green tofu so popular in Taiwan, ch'ou doufu ("foul-smelling tofu", or "stinky tofu"), made from pressed tofu squares aged with rice wine lees to which has been added crushed leaves and a green. Despite its overpowering aroma, slimy texture, unappetizing color and the unfortunate odor it leaves on the breath, those brave enough to partake of it consider it a delicacy. 
 
 Chiang-doufu : 
 Chiang-doufu, or firm cubes of tofu fermented for several days in soy sauce (chiang-yu) or Chinese-style  miso  (chiang) is red-brown in colour and salty or salty-sweet depending on whether rice wine or mould was introduced before fermentation. Chiang-doufu sauce (chiang-doufu chih), used to flavor Chinese lamb or beef dishes, is the result of mashing pickled tofu to a smooth paste with its pickling liquor.
