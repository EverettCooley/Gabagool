Description : 
 Black beans
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 1 lb package  red kidney beans 
 3 tbsp  tomato paste  (this is optional. you may use one can of  tomato sauce  instead.) 
 3 tbsp  olive oil 
 4 tbsp  salt 
 1 tsp  black pepper 
 2 tbsp  oregano 
 ¼ lb of cooking  ham  ( ham steak ) cut into small squares. ( ham  adds a nice flavor but is also optional.) 
 ¼ cup  sofrito 
 Directions : 
 Check beans, look for stones, and discard any beans that are not whole. 
 Rinse beans in cold  water , drain, and place in a 5-quart pot. 
 Soak overnight in 5 – 6 cups  water  if you have time. 
 However, if you would like to make them the same day, bring the beans to a boil in four cups of  water , turn off the burner and let stand for an hour. 
 If you are using the beans that have soaked overnight, drain, add four cups of  water , bring to a boil, lower heat and let simmer. 
 Brown the  ham  lightly in the  olive oil . 
 Add sofrito and stir. 
 Now stir in the  tomato  paste and the rest of the ingredients. 
 Once the flavors have blended and you have a nice consistency pour this mixture into the bean pot and stir. 
 Place the frying pan back on the stove and deglaze the pan with ½ cup of the broth from the bean pot and then return this mixture to the bean pot. 
 Let beans simmer for about 30 minutes at medium heat and reduce heat to a low simmer for about 1½ hours stirring now and then. 
 Add  water  as needed. 
 Taste for  salt  and other herbs and spices. 
 You will know that the beans are ready when you can press them with a fork and they are soft to the touch, however, you don't want them too soft. The sauce should be fairly thick.
