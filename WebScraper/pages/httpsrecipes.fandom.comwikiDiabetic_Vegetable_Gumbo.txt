 In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white

 5–7 minutes. Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring

 Note : 
 Cut fresh  corn  from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the 
 remaining  corn  off the cob. Four ears will make about two cups. If
 you use dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before
 adding to the pot, this releases their aroma and goodness
