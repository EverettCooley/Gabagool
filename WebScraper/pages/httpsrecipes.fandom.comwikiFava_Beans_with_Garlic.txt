 Serves 4 
 Ingredients : 
 2 lb  fava (broad) beans , shelled (about 2 cups) 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 1 tbsp  olive oil 
 ¼ cup minced  yellow onion 
 1 clove  garlic , minced 
 ½ cup  vegetable stock ,  chicken stock  or broth 
 ¼ tsp freshly ground  black pepper 
 1 tsp chopped fresh  flat-leaf (Italian) parsley 
 Directions : 
 Bring a large saucepan ¾ full of water to a boil. 
 Add the fava beans and ¼ teaspoon of the salt and cook for 2 minutes. 
 Drain and rinse immediately with cold water to stop the cooking. 
 To remove the skins, pinch each bean on the side opposite where it was attached to the pod; the bean should slip easily from the skin. 
 Remove and discard the outer skins. 
 Set the beans aside. 
 In a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
 Add the onion and saute until soft and lightly golden, about 6 minutes. 
 Add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds; don't let the garlic brown. 
 Add the fava beans and stock and bring to a boil. 
 Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, shaking the pan gently from time to time, until the beans are tender, about 15 minutes. 
 Season with the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and the pepper. 
 Sprinkle with the parsley and serve immediately. 
 Notes : 
 Dietitian's tip: Once removed from the pods, fava beans are blanched to remove their thin but tough outer skins. This simple recipe lets
their flavor shine.
