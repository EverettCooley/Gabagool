Ingredients : 
 1/4 cup butter 
 1/2 cup firmly-packed brown sugar 
 1/2 cup light corn syrup 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 4 to 8 drops green food coloring 
 3 quarts popped popcorn 
 Instructions : 
 Preheat the oven to 250 F. 
 Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the sugar and light corn syrup. Let it come to a boil. When the sugar dissolves, remove the caramel syrup from the heat. 
 Stir in the salt and baking soda. The syrup will bubble up. Let it settle down a bit, stirring, then add the green food coloring. 
 Start with 4 to 5 drops. Stir it in. Add more food coloring until it reaches the desired shade of green. 
 Place the popcorn in a large mixing bowl. Pour the green caramel syrup over the popcorn. Toss to coat the popcorn well. 
 Divide the popcorn between two jelly roll pans that have been lined with Silpat mats. Spread the green popcorn out into an even layer. 
 Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. 
 Serve and enjoy immediately, or store the popcorn in an airtight container.
