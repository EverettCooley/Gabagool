 About apricot nectar : 
 Apricot has about as much vitamin C in its fruit if it is gathered ripe or quite hard. On the other hand the carotene builds up to a high level during the final ripening period so that the fully tree ripened apricot has more than 200% extra. Select well coloured, tender fruits that are neither greenish nor tending to shrivel.
