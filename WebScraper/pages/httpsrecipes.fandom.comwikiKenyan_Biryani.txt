 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 kg Mutton/ Chicken 
 1 kg  basmati rice 
 100 grm  yogurt 
 salt  to taste 
 1 medium  Onion 
 6  garlic  cloves 
 1 tbs  ginger  paste 
 8 small illaichi ( green cardamom ) 
 1 tbs  garlic  paste 
 10 cloves 
 oil  or  ghee 
 kewra  few drops 
 Yellow food color two pinch 
 Sugar  a pinch 
 Directions : 
 Add mutton,  salt  and  garlic  cloves in a pot with two glasses of  water . If you're using  Chicken , you can do with only one glass of  water . 
 Cook on a low flame till the meat is tender and the  water  dries. 
 Take one medium  Onion . Slice it and fry it in about 4-5 tablespoons of  oil  till its light brown. #Add the rest of the spices,  yogurt  and fry it a little. 
 Simultaneously soak the  rice  in  water  for half an hour. 
 Boil the  rice  till they're half cooked, drain the  water  and keep them aside. 
 Add the cooked meat to the sautéed  onions  to make the  masala  and cook uncovered for a few minutes to evaporate excess  water . 
 When most of the  water  has evaporated, transfer a little  rice  to a pot, and on top of that add some of the meat/ masala  combo. Make layers of this. The way I usually do it is put half the  rice  in, add all the meat/ masala  then top that off with the rest of the  rice . 
 Sprinkle on it a solution of  kewra , yellow food color and pinch of  Sugar . 
 Keep it covered and on a low flame. 
 Keep the pot tightly closed - you're trying to steam cook the  rice . When the  rice  is done, the biryani is ready. 
 Serve with salad or  garlic  chutney.
