Description : 
 Very tasty, everyone gets the toppings they prefer, and the chips stay crisp! Provide everyone with a  butter  knife to spread the  beans  onto the chips, and add toppings as desired. 
 If you feel nachos must have  cheese , the recipe is not quite as simple. but try it the other way first.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1½ cup cook  white beans 
 tomatoes , finely chopped 
 canned mild or  green chilis 
 canned hot  jalapeno  chilis 
 Onion , finely chopped 
 diced  red bell pepper , fresh or roasted 
 whatever else seems good to you (my husband opted for ) 
 Directions : 
 Mix all ingredients 
 Fill a big bowl with baked Tostitos. 
 If adding cheese, then you have to spread  beans  on each chip, arrange them on a cookie sheet and sprinkle the other ingredients, including shredded  cheese , over them. THen bake at 350 °F just till  cheese  is melted.
