Description : 
 Mandarínu-ostakaka - Mandarin- orange   Cheese  cake
 This is a lovely cheesecake, rich and smooth. It is commercially available in Iceland. The cake is relatively cheap when you buy it ready-made, but I think making it yourself adds to the enjoyment of eating it. Serves 10-12.

 1⅔ cup  graham cracker  crumbs 
 5 tbsp  sugar 
 5 tbsp  butter , soft
