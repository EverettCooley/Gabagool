A wine term that describes the removal of lees (dead yeast cells) from champagne bottles. Lees are left behind after the completion of the second fermentation process, and are removed by freezing the neck of the bottle using a brine solution. The bottles seal is then removed, allowing lees to 'pop out' in a frozen form.
