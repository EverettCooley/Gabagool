 2 cups cooked  rice 
 2 cups smoked  yellowfish , smoked  haddock 
 Â¾ cup  heavy cream 
 1 tsp  curry powder

 You can use any or shell but i use thick slabs of smoked yellowfish, or thick slabs of smoked  haddock . 
 Thin fillets tend to break up into pieces too small.

 Drain and refrigerate. 
 Allowing to boil will turn it into mush during final cooking.

 In a microwave dish or double boiler, melt  butter  and heat  cream  (reserving 3 tsp for moisture adjustment). 
 Add cooked  rice  and mix well. 
 Gently break cold into bite size pieces and add to mixture. 
 Chop hard boiled  eggs  and add to mixture. 
 Adjust moisture before heating mixture. 
 Microwave mixture should be moist but not damp. 
 If using double boiler to heat mixture, add reserved  cream  until mixture is slightly sloppy or it will dry out during heating. 
 Heat mixture in microwave on high, stirring every minute until hot. 
 Garnish with chopped  parsley  and serve.
