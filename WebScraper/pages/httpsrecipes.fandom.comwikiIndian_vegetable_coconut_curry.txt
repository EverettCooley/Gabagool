The Indian vegetable coconut curries have a large number of varieties out of which this is a basic variety. Its a highly nutritional recipe without compromising the taste. This food has a very mild and soothing taste which can be a very good source of maximum nutrients in summer.
 
 Ingredients : 
 
 Vegetables -  Capsicum  (Red, Yellow, Green),  Broccoli ,  Potato ,  Tomato , Onion leaves- to taste (half of each of the vegetables)
  Onion - 1 medium sized
  Chickpeas - 2 tablespoon
  Coconut milk  (heavy milk)- 1 cup
 [[Mustard]- 1 tsp
  Cumin  seeds- 1 tsp
  Butter - to taste (start from 1 tablespoon)/  oil /  Ghee 
 Salt - to taste
  Chilli powder -1 tsp
  Coriander seedpowder - 1 tsp
 Pav bhaji masala -1 tsp/optional
  Water - 1 cup (depending on the amount of gravy needed)

 
 Directions : 
 
Add oil in a deep pan (big enough to accommodate all the vegetable), and sprinkle some mustard, cumin. Grind the onion into a paste and pour into the pan with the oil. Fry for few minutes and add the tomato paste/tomato/pesto rosso for 5 minutes. Then add the vegetables. I kept cutting the vegetables and added them simultaneously while cooking. Fry them for 5 more minutes. Add the rest of the powders and pour in the coconut milk into the mixture and boil the vegetables in it for 5 minutes. Then add water and boil it depending on the amount of gray needed by you.
