 Simmer until  rice  is well cooked but not dry (approx. 
 30 minutes).

 Add mixture,  milk ,  sugar  and  ice  (and  rum ) to blender; use 1 cup  milk  for every Â½ cup of  rice  mixture. 
 Frappe until smooth and creamy. 
 For a stronger  pineapple  taste, add whole pieces of  pineapple  when blending.
