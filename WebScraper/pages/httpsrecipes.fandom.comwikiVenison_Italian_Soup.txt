Description : 
 Ground venison is sautéed with onion and garlic and added to this tomato based soup with Italian seasonings, pinto beans, vegetables and ziti pasta.
 To lower the carbs on this leave out the pasta or use a low carb alternative. This is also high in fiber although that nutrition information was not included with the recipe. This would also work with ground beef, turkey or chicken. Take care, Gloria
