 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  onions , chopped 
 3 cloves  garlic 
 2  tomatoes , chopped 
 1 lbs  beans, canned 
 4 cup  water 
 2 cup quick  brown rice ,  quinoa  or  couscous

 Saut√©  onions  and  garlic  in  olive oil  until tender.

 Season with herbs and spices of your choice.

 Nutritional information : 
 Food exchange per serving: 1 starch/bread + 1 vegetable
 
 I would cut back on the beans to make it count as 1 starch/bread. I also would use a combination of  couscous  and  quinoa  and even add any free vegetables.
