Description : 
       Lower-low-cal Buttermilk Bacon Spinach Quiche     
 I modified Quiche Lorraine by adding  spinach  and using lower fat items like  buttermilk  and  light cream . Yes real men do eat quiche, and they make it as well. You can use this as a main course for breakfast or cut into small squares as an hors d'oeuvre. You can each it cold or warm. Quiche is the ultimate food. You can also substitute whatever vegetables you have around for the  bacon  and  spinach .
