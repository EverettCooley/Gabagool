Algerian Stuffed Vegetables
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 small  onions 
 4 small  tomatoes 
 1  zucchini  cut into even cylinders approximately the same height as the  onions  and  tomatoes 
 Stuffing:
 
 100 gm of ground  Lamb  or  Beef 
 5-6  green olives * (use Spanish or Italian if you cannot find Algerian ), chopped 
 1  shallot  minced 
 1 tablespoon of chopped herbs such as  basil ,  thyme , flat leaf  parsley  or  coriander leaf  ( cilantro ) 
 salt  and  pepper 
 1  egg 
 butter 
 olive oil 
 Directions : 
 1) Stuff the Vegetables with the stuffing. 
 2) Drizzle some olive in the pan and dot the vegetables with  butter . A lot of the fat will cook off into the baking dish and can be drained before service. The  onions  take longer to become tender, some cooks start cooking them first for about 15–20 minutes. 
 3) Cover with foil and bake in a preheated 350F (175C) until tender, about 1 hour depending on the size of your vegetables. 
 4) Remove the foil about 10–15 minutes before the end of cooking to color them a bit.
 5) You can sprinkle some fresh herbs as a garnish.
