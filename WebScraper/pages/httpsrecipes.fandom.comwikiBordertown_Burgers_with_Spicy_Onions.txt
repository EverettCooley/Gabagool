Bordertown Burgers with Spicy Onions
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 1 large sweet onion, halved and thinly sliced 
 4 tablespoons TABASCO� brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce, divided 
 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef 
 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 
 1/4 cup chopped green onion 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 4 slices Monterey Jack cheese 
 4 hamburger buns, toasted 
 Mixed baby greens 
 Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add onion and cook 
5 minutes or until golden brown, stirring often. Stir in 1 tablespoon 
TABASCO� Chipotle Sauce and the Worcestershire sauce; mix well and 
remove from heat.
 Combine ground beef, cilantro, green onion, salt and the remaining 3 
tablespoons TABASCO� Chipotle Sauce; mix well and shape into 4
