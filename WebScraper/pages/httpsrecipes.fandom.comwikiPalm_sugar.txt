 Wikipedia Article  About Palm sugar on Wikipedia 
 Palm sugar was originally made from the sugary sap of the Palmyra palm, which has a very rough trunk and large, fan shaped leaves. Now it is generally made from the sap of the coconut palms and may be sold as coconut sugar. The sugar is a light golden brown paste, sold in tubs or in blocks.
