 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  water 
 1 cup  white wine  or  red wine 
 1 cup  cider vinegar 
 2 (6 ounce) cans  tomato paste 
 ½ cup  molasses 
 ¼ cup  brown sugar , firmly packed (optional) 
 2 teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce , to taste 
 2 tablespoons  liquid smoke , to taste 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 1 teaspoon granulated  onion 
 1 teaspoon  garlic  granules 
 1 teaspoon sweet  paprika 
 1 teaspoon fresh ground  black pepper 
 1 teaspoon  chili powder , to taste 
 Directions : 
 Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
 Whisk until smooth, which will probably take a lot of whisking to get the  tomato paste  mixed in. 
 Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low; and simmer, uncovered, for about 50–60 minutes or until the mixture is thick, stirring occasionally. 
 Taste and add more Worcestershire and/or  liquid smoke  if desired. 
 Cool, then store in a covered container in the refrigerator to allow flavors to develop. 
 This sauce will keep for months in the refrigerator. 
 The recipe doubles or triples very well, so make a big batch, and keep it in the fridge all the time.
