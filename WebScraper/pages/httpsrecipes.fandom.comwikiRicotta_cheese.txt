 Wikipedia Article  About Ricotta cheese on Wikipedia 
 Ricotta (pronounced /ri'kot-ta/ in Italian) is an Italian cheese made from the whey which results when making cheeses such as mozzarella or provolone. The name "ricotta" means "cooked again" in Italian, referring to the second processing of the liquid to produce the cheese. Ricotta is similar in texture to cottage cheese though considerably lighter and is a key ingredient in cheesecake, lasagna and many cannoli. It is often served mixed with sugar, cinnamon and occasionally chocolate shavings as a dessert in Italian households.
