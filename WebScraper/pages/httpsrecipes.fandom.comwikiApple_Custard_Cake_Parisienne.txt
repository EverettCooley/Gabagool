APPLE CUSTARD CAKE PARISIENNE
 BASE:
 
  1/4 lb. butter, melted
 1 c. sugar
 2 eggs, beaten
 2 c. flour
 2 tsp. baking powder
 4 lbs. cooking apples
 
 CUSTARD:
 
  1 c. sugar
 1/4 lb. butter, melted
 1 egg
 1 tsp. vanilla
 
 To prepare base, add sugar and beaten eggs to the melted
butter. Stir in sifted flour and baking powder. Use your
hands to press all ingredients together and pat mixture
into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9 inch
spring-form pan.
 Peel, core, and slice the apples. Fill the pan right up to
the top with the apples, arranging the top slices neatly.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour 15 minutes.
During the final 15 minutes, take care not to burn the
crust.
 For the custard, beat the ingredients together until well
blended. Pour the custard over the cake and bake for an
additional 20 minutes or so. Cool thoroughly and
refrigerate overnight before serving. Serves 12.
