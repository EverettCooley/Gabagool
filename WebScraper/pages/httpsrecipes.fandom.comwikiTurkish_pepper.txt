 About Turkish pepper : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Turkish pepper on Wikipedia 
 Turkish Pepper or Tyrkisk Peber (Turkinpippuri) is a strong liquorice candy flavored with ammonium chloride (salmiakki), made by the Finnish company Fazer and popular in the country.
 The basic variant is a large, hollow round shell both coated and filled with salmiakki powder. A number of others exist, most of which vary in type and strength of flavor but keep the shape. It no doubt adds to their popularity that Turkish Pepper is sometimes used to make the cocktail salmiakkikoskenkorva.
 If you open a bag of Turkinpippuri's, make sure you reseal the bag or eat them all within a few days. If you leave them out too long, the moisture in a room will eventually cause the candies to begin melting and sticking together.
