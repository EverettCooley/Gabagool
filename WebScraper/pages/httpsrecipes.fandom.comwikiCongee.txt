 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup short-grained  rice 
 1/2 cup  glutinous rice 
 6 cups Chinese  chicken broth , or 
 6 cups regular  chicken broth  with 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 slice  ginger  the size of a quarter 
 Directions : 
 Wash  rice . Place in pot with Chinese  chicken broth , or regular  chicken broth  to which soy and  ginger  has been added. 
 Bring to a boil. When boiling, reduce heat to low. Cook for 2 hours, partially covered, stirring frequently. Soup is done when it reaches a porridge-like consistency. Remove  ginger  slice if you have added it. 
 You can add chopped  bok choy , or small slivers of  Chicken . Leftover  Turkey  after a Thanksgiving meal is another great addition, and a  Turkey  carcass can provide a nice broth instead of  Chicken  soup.
