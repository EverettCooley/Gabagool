 2 tablespoons  butter 
 Parsley-pecan sauce : 
 2 cups tightly packed fresh  parsley , leaves and tender stems only

 Cover the pan and cook for about 2 minutes longer or until flakes easily when tested with a fork and sauce is melted. 
 Using a spatula, place  catfish  on an oven-proof platter.

 Reheat the  catfish  on the platter by briefly placing them under the broiler just before serving, if necessary.
