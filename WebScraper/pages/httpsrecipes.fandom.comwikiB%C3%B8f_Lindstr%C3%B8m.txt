       Bøf Lindstrøm     
 Ingredients : 
 ½ kg minced  Beef 
 2 small  onions 
 2 tbsp  capers 
 4 tbsp chopped pickled beetroot 
 1  egg yolk 
 salt  and  pepper 
 butter  for frying 
 1 stock cube 
 2 tbsp  cream cheese 
 watercress for garnish 
 Directions : 
 Knead the minced  Beef , chopped  Onion ,  capers , chopped pickled beetroot,  egg yolk  and herbs and spices with the hands to a firm consistency. 
Shape the meat into thick burgers and fry for a few minutes on each side in the  butter . 
The idea is that they are quite rare inside, but that is a matter of taste.  
Place the burgers in a heated serving tray and garnish with the watercress. 
Add 400 ml  water  and the stock cube to the pan.  
Melt the  cream cheese  in the stock and season.  
Sere the gravy with the burgers, mashed  potatoes  and a large bowl of salad.
