Description : 
 Serves 4, three kebobs per serving.
 
 Original recipe 
 Ingredients : 
 12 wood or metal skewers, 6 to 8 inches long 
 2 skinless boneless  chicken breast  halves (1 lb. total) 
 36 small  cherry tomatoes  (about 12 oz.) 
 1 tablespoon  olive oil , for basting 
 Marinade : 
 â…” cup Nakano Seasoned  rice vinegar  Basil and Oregano 
 4 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 1 teaspoon dried  oregano 
 1 teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon coarse ground  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Soak wooden skewers in water until ready to use. 
 Combine marinade ingredients; let stand 10 minutes for flavors to blend. 
 Meanwhile, cut chicken breasts lengthwise into thin strips. Place strips in a sealable plastic bag or non-metallic container; add marinade. 
 Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. 
 If kebobs will be broiled, preheat broiler and line a rimmed sheet tray with foil. 
 Drain chicken, discarding marinade. 
 Thread one end of a chicken strip on a skewer followed by a cherry tomato and the other end of chicken. 
 Repeat so there are 3 tomatoes on each skewer and all chicken is used. 
 Double up on the chicken as needed. 
 Place kebobs on sheet tray (or dish if kebobs will be grilled) and brush with olive oil. 
 Broil about 10 minutes, turning kebobs over halfway through. 
 Serve immediately.
