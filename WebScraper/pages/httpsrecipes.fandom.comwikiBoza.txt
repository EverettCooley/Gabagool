 Description : 
 Boza is a beverage made of fermented  millet .
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 kg  bulgur  (boiled and pounded  Wheat ) 
 250 gr bread  yeast 
 1/2 kg  granulated sugar 
 Directions : 
 Boza is the favorite drink of particularly cold winter nights, and is sold by the boza sellers as they walk around the streets. Boza sellers who frighten the children with their deep voices are traditional characters of old Istanbul. Clean the stalks and stones from the  bulgur , wash several times and cook in plenty of  water  until it becomes a  mush . Remove from heat, cover with a piece of cloth to keep warm and let it stand overnight. Strain the  mush  which is almost solidified through the strainer. In another bowl dissolve the bread  yeast  in warm  water , strain and add to the  bulgur . Add the  Sugar  and put in a glass jar or glazed pan, close to lid tightly. Once in a while stir with a scoop. After 3-4 days a not too sour boza will be obtained. Put the boza in glasses, sprinkle  cinnamon  over and serve along with roasted yellow chick  Peas  (leblebi).
