Ingredients : 
 1 (16 ounce) can  refried beans 
 ¼ cup  spaghetti sauce 
 1 tablespoon hot  chili sauce 
 1 (16 ounce) package 10-inch flour  tortillas 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 cup  canola oil  (for frying...less if you wish..about ¼-inch deep in your pan) 
 Directions : 
 Place  refried beans ,  spaghetti  Sauce and Hot  chili sauce  into medium sized mixing bowl and stir together well. 
 Cut  flour  Tortillas into approximately 3” x 4” squares (cut down the middle and then square up so you get 2 squares per tortilla). 
 Place approximately 1 Tablespoon of the mixture along the long side of each tortilla square and then roll up and seal. 
 Each roll should be approximately ½” thick and about 4” long. 
 Place  oil  (about ¼" deep) in the bottom of a skillet and add  salt . 
 Heat  oil  fairly hot (deep fry heat) so that it is ready to fry. 
 You can test by trying to cook one taquito first—it should not burn quickly, but should turn brown within a few minutes. 
 When the  oil  is ready, place rolled tortilla’s in skillet. 
 Fry for a few minutes then turn (when bottom side is browned). 
 The Taquitos should be golden brown all over. 
 Remove carefully from pan and repeat until all are cooked. 
 Serve hot with  sour cream , salsa, or other toppings and dips to suit.
