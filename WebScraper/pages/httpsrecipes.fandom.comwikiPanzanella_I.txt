Description : 
 Italian bread salad. The consistency is comparable to  potato  or  rice  salad. Everything is moist and clinging together but it isnit soupy nor is it dry. Ripe, juicy homegrown  tomatoes  (this provides most of the moisture in the dish, some of which used to come from  olive oil ) i think this tastes best at room temperature. The bread should make up about Â¾ of the salad.
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 hard  baguette 
 ripe, juicy  tomatoes 
 minced  onions  or  scallions  ( red onions  look nice) 
 capers 
 minced  bell peppers 
 minced fresh  garlic 
 minced fresh  basil 
 minced fresh  parsley 
 salt 
 red wine vinegar 
 freshly cracked  pepper 
 Directions : 
 If using a very hard baguette, run it under some  water  and then crumble it into a bowl. Alternatively you can cube the bread or lightly toast it if it's fresh and then cut into cubes. 
 Add the remaining ingredients to taste.
