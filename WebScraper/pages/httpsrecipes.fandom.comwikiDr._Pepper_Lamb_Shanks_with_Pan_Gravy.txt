Description : 
 This is the first recipe I made using my newly refurbished CE. I did not use a rack or helper handles. I did use the browning feature, though. I made the sauce and then added the browned shanks to the sauce and proceeded to cook under pressure. They turned out wonderfully! We all loved them.
