Ingredients : 
 1 kg / 2¼ lbs  aubergines  (buy them only if they are in season) 
 a few  celery leaves , blanched 
 1 bunch  spring onions , sliced finely 
 120 ml / 4 fl oz extra virgin  olive oil 
 10 g / ½ oz  garlic , chopped very finely 
 25 ml / 1 fl oz  lemon juice 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Directions : 
 Fill up your largest pot with  water  and bring to the boil. 
 Drop in all the aubergines, of course if there is plenty of space for them to feel comfortable. 
 Boil them for approximately 10 minutes or until they feel quite soft when you prick them with a small knife. 
 Remember to turn them a couple of times, as they need to be cooked evenly. 
 Remove them with a slotted spoon. 
 Hang them from the washing line and let the  water  absorbed during their cooking time drain off. 
 In a different and smaller pot blanch the  celery leaves  and the spring  onions  for a few minutes. 
 Drain the  water . 
 When cold enough to handle, bring the aubergines to your chopping board and coarsely chop. 
 Place the chopped aubergines in a large mixing bowl. 
 Add the blanched  celery leaves , spring  onions ,  garlic ,  lemon juice   olive oil , and seasoning and mix well. 
 If the weather is not very hot you can leave the aubergines outside the fridge, and you should let the flavours infuse for couple of days.
