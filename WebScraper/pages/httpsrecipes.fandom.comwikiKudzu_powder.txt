 Wikipedia Article  About Kudzu powder on Wikipedia 
 The starchy roots are ground into a fine powder and used for varieties of Wagashi and herbal medicines. When added to water and heated, kudzu powder becomes clear and adds stickiness to the food. The name Kudzu appeared first in Kojiki and Nihonshoki as a type of vine or Kazura (葛 or 蔓) used commonly by the people who lived in Kudzu (国栖), area around present-day Yoshino, Nara prefecture. It is unclear whether the name was taken from the people or the name of the plant was applied to the people. Kudzu has been in use for over 1300 years and it is speculated that it goes back even further. In the Nara and Heian era, records had been found that they were collected and sent as a part of tax. Even today, "Yoshino Kudzu" has the best image of kudzu powder yet. Kagoshima prefecture is the largest producer of kudzu products.
