Description : 
 A rich garlic soup from Cuba.
 
 Serves 4 – 6. 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ a bulb of  garlic 
 ½ a large  yellow onion , thinly sliced 
 1 stick of  butter 
 6 cups of  chicken ,  beef  or  vegetable stock 
 salt  and freshly ground  white pepper  to taste 
 1 piece of toast, cubed or torn, or a few croutons, per person 
 1  egg  per person (optional) 
 cream  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Split the garlic bulb into individual cloves and peek and mash them. 
 Sauté the mashed  garlic  and  onion  slowly in a large saucepan using the  butter  until the onions are translucent, being careful not to let the garlic burn. 
 Blend the mixture in a food processor or blender. 
 Slowly add some broth to the mixture and keep blending until you have a smooth mixture. 
 Return this mixture to a saucepan adding the rest of the broth and seasonings. 
 For a creamier soup, cream can be used instead of part of all of the remaining broth. 
 To serve, add the toast or croutons to each bowl, break a fresh egg into each bowl and then top with soup.
