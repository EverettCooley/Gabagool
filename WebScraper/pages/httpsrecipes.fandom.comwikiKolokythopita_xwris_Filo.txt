Description : 
 Zucchini pie without filo
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 medium size  zucchini , grated and strained 
 1 kg  flour 
 4  eggs , beaten 
 ¼ kg  feta  cheese 
 1 cup fresh  milk 
 1 cup  yoghurt 
 1 cup  olive oil 
 oregano 
 salt 
 pepper 
 Directions : 
 Mix in a bowl the  milk , the  yoghurt , the  cheese  and the grated  zucchini . 
 Add  flour  and season with  salt ,  pepper  and  oregano . Mix well in order to make a thick pulp. 
 Baste with  oil  a large baking pan. 
 The reason for using a large baking pan is for making the pie as thin as possible because otherwise it won't be baked inside. Pour the mixture into the pan and pour  oil  over it. 
 Preheat the oven and bake in 180°C until pie is baked inside and becomes crusty.
