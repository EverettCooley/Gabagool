 About Guajillo chile : 
 The skin of this dried chile is shiny-smooth and a deep, burnished red. The chile is very tough and must be soaked longer than most dried chiles. The flavorful guajillo is pointed, long and narrow (about 4 inches by 1 inch). Because it can be quite hot, the guajillo is also sometimes called the travieso (mischievous') Chile in reference to its not-so-playful sting. Ifs used in both sauces and cooked dishes.
 The guajillo chile are part of the  Mirasol chiles  family. Besides the guajillo chile, other species that are included in this family are the cascabel or rattle and catarina or ladybug chiles. The guajillo chile is also related with the  pulla chile  and the  costeno chiles . The family of mirasols are found in a bright color of orange-red; they are thin and have a medium length. The heat of the mirasol chiles is direct, flavored and intense and that is why it is used a lot in mild and soft meals, like soups, stews or sauces. Still, the guajillo is found in a more translucent red, has thin walls and its texture is rather dry. The flavor of this chile is more delicate and less hot. 
 The  guajillo costeno  chile is a more special kind of the guajillo chile, considering the fact that it is an old heirloom pepper from the cayenne family, in an orange-red color and with a sweeter heat and flavor. This kind of chiles are used in various meals, regardless of the cuisine, region and cooking style, as they are among the most popular types of chiles.
