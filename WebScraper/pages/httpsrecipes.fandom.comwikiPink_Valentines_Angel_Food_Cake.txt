 Ingredients : 
 1 angel food cake, not the giant size 
 pinch of  salt 
 2½ cup boiling  water 
 ½ pint  whipping cream  ( Cool Whip  is easier) 
 2 (10 oz) package of  strawberries  frozen (not those bags of whole berries, these are rather square containers like an OJ container) 
 2 (3 oz) package  strawberry  Jell-o 
 Directions : 
 Dissolve Jell-O in that hot  water  and add  salt  and packages of  strawberries . (the frozen  strawberries  will add juice) 
 Stir until the  strawberries  are thawed. 
 Chill until partially set. 
 Fold in the  whipped cream  to this mix. 
 Rub off the brown from the cake, you want white only. 
 Tear into 1 inch squares, don't cut, just rip it up. If you have a Jell-O mould you can use it now, or any glass bowl is nice. 
 Layer cake then  strawberry  mixture, lots of layers. 
 Chill overnight. 
 Top with whipped cream and fresh  strawberries .
