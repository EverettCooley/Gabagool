One of the biggest secrets of great griddling is in the meat selection. This is particularly important when it comes to lamb. Knowing what you are getting is vital to getting the meat you want. While lamb might not be a one of the meats think about griddling, no other meat benefits more from the fire like lamb. This Greek-style marinade can be applied to any meat, but is particularly good on lamb. Let the meat marinade for a while so the flavors can infuse Pour most of the marinade over the lamb. Swish the lamb around and get it soaked on both sides. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least several hours, turning occasionally. To cook up a tender piece of lamb or mutton you need to first tenderize and marinade. Depending on what cut you're using, take the meat and pound it well with a meat tenderizer. This will help breakdown the meat density, allowing it to cook more evenly and allowing the fats and tendons to breakdown more. Then apply a marinade. You'll want to let this sit for a good day, or at least overnight. Traditional marinades for lamb start with olive oil and end up with a seasoning of mint, lemon or garlic. I prefer the garlic. Adding mint to lamb is in my opinion just a way to cover the strong flavor of older cuts.
