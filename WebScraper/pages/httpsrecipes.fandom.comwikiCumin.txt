 About Cumin : 
 Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to the eastern Mediterranean region east to India.
 Cumin is an herbaceous annual plant in the carrot family, with a slender branched stem 20-30 cm tall. The leaves are 5-10 cm long, pinnate or bipinnate, with thread-like leaflets. The flowers are small, white or pink, and borne in umbels. The fruit is a laterally compressed fusiform or ovoid achene 4-5 mm long, containing a single seed. Cumin seeds are similar to fennel seeds, but are smaller and darker in color.
 The ground seeds of the cumin plant are used as flavoring in marinades and sauces.
