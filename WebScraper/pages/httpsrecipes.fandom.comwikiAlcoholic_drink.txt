 Cider and Perry : 
 Hard cider  (known simply as 'cider' in the UK) is made by fermenting apple juice; the less common  perry  by fermenting pear juice. Both can be made in a variety of styles, but the alcoholic strength is usually similar to that of beer.
 
 Wines : 
 Wine  usually has an alcohol content of between 10 and 15 percent, and is made by fermentation of grape juice. Fortified wine such as  Port  and  Sherry  is made by adding brandy to wine, increasing the strength to around 20 per cent.
 
 Spirits : 
 The term  spirits  includes brandy, rum, vodka and whisky. These are made by distilling weaker drinks to concentrate the alcohol content to 35 per cent or more.
