Description : 
 This is the kind of barbecue sauce to slather over ribs and chicken and then lick
up every last bit from lips and fingers. Thick, sweet, tangy, smoky and ever so slightly spicy, it can be mixed with cooked pork for the most heavenly barbecue sandwiches, stirred into mayonnaise for a sandwich spread, or added to sour cream for a quick chip dip. Sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen.
