 Description : 
       Roast Pork Loin in Beer Sauce     
 Pork loin and real beer normally combine while beurre manié is poured into the meat before serving. Serve up a meaty treat with other main dishes while it then maintains a red-hot kick with the meat.
 
 Ingredients : 
 For the meat base : 
 3 ½-pounds boneless pork loin, tied (3 to 3 ½ inches wide) 
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 Beurre manié : 
 1 tablespoon softened unsalted butter 
 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
 Marinade : 
 ½ cup Dijon mustard 
 1 large onion, chopped or minced, red, white, or yellow only 
 ½ cup honey 
 3 cups beer (not dark), preferably German  or  (2 cans beer, any brand) 
 Directions : 
 Marinade : 
 In a large saucepan, stir the marinade ingredients. 
 Bring the marinade just to a boil, stirring (marinade will rise and foam), and remove pan from heat. 
 In a blender, purée the marinade in 2 batches, transferring it as puréed to bowl. 
 Cool the marinade to room temperature and spoon off any remaining foam. 
 Beurre manié : 
 Mix by rubbing together softened butter and 1 tablespoon flour. 
 Assembly : 
 In a large heavy resealable plastic bag combine pork and marinade and seal bag, pressing out any excess air. 
 Put the bag in a baking pan and marinate pork, chilled, turning bag once or twice, at least 8 hours and up to 24. 
 Let pork in marinade come to room temperature, about 40 minutes. 
 Transfer marinade to a saucepan and bring just to a boil. Preheat an oven to 375° F. 
 Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. 
 In a flameproof roasting pan, heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown pork on all sides. 
 Roast pork in the middle of the oven, basting frequently with some marinade, until a meat thermometer registers 155° F (for slightly pink meat, cook 1 to 1½ hours). 
 Transfer pork to a cutting board, reserving juices in roasting pan and discarding string, and let stand, covered loosely with foil, about 15 minutes. 
 While pork is standing, skim and discard fat from pan and add remaining marinade. 
 Deglaze the roasting pan over moderately high heat, scraping up brown bits. Bring the sauce just to a boil and strain through a fine sieve into another saucepan. 
 Bring the sauce to a simmer and mix with the beurre manié, bit by bit, whisking until sauce is combined well and thickened slightly. Serve the pork, sliced, with sauce.
