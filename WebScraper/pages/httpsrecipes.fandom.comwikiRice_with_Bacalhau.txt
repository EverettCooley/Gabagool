 Slice the oinon. Remove the  tomato  skin and seed; then cut into small slices. Chop the  cabbage  into big pieces. 
 Cook the  rice  in  rice  cooker together with the  tomato  and  cabbage  (since the  cabbage  and  tomato  have  water  in them, you should add  water  well below the indicated line on the rice-cooker; or the  rice  would become too wet). 
 Stir fry the bacalhau with the  Onion  and the seasonings. Afterward, place the bacalhau and  Onion  aside for later use. 
 When the  rice  is almost cooked, put the bacalhau and  Onion  on top of the  rice . 
 Cover the  rice  cooker and let it continue to cook. When the  rice  is fully cooked, mixed the  rice  and all the indigents together.
