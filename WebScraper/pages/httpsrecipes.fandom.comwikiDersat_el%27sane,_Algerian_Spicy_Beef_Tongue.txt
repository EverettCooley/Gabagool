 Ingredients : 
 1  Beef  tongue (boil in  water  for about 20 minutes, peel off the skin with a very sharp knife) 
 3  tomatoes  concassee 
 2 red  bell peppers  chopped 
 1  Onion  chopped 
 2  carrots  cut into rounds 
 1 branch of  celery  chopped 
 2  bay leaves 
 Optional herbs include  thyme ,  basil , flat leaf parsely or  coriander leaf . 
 Vineger or  lemon  juice,  cumin ,  paprika  and  turmeric . 
 salt  and  pepper 
 Olive  oil 
 Directions : 
 1. In a big pot saute the  onions  in olive  oil  for about 15 minutes over medium/low heat, add the  carrots  and  celery  season with  salt  cook for about 15 minutes. Add the  tomatoes ,  peppers  and the peeled tongue. Cover with  water . Season with  salt  using a light hand. (The sauce will be reduced later so in this case you are not salting to taste until the reduction), bring to a boil and reduce heat to a very gentle simmer, add the  bay leaves  and cook for about 2 hours. Algerians tend to cook tongue to a very soft texture, if you like your tongue a little firmer, well then stop cooking it when it's done to your liking.
 2. Remove the tongue from the broth when it's done. Pass the broth and the vegetables through a sieve or a food mill. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of spices, reduce the sauce by 2/3 at a gentle boil, taste for  salt , adjust if necessary.
 3. Slice the tongue as shown in the first plate and add it back to the broth, add 1 tablespoon of  vinegar  or  lemon  juice and heat through. Adding  vinegar  about 5â€“10 minutes before a slow cooked soup or stew is done is a very common Maghrebi cooking trick. It brightens up the slow cook flavors.
