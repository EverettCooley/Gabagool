 About Dark chocolate : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Dark chocolate on Wikipedia 
 Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to cacao. It is chocolate without milk as an additive, although in the United States, it is added in most commonly found chocolates. It is sometimes called "plain chocolate" and "black chocolate". The U.S. Government has no definition for dark chocolate, only "sweet chocolate", which requires 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. Sweet chocolate is never necessarily dark chocolate, as there is no restriction of milk in it. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.
