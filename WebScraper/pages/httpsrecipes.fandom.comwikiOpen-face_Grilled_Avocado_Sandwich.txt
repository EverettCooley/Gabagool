Description : 
 This Open Face Grilled  avocado  Sandwich is "Food for the Gods". It is so good, that it probably should be labeled a "controlled substance" by the Food and Drug Administration!
 I have prepared this recipe hundreds of times as a young man growing up in Whittier, California, using tree-ripened Fuerte, Anaheim, and  Lyon  avocados.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 slices of 7-grain whole wheat bread 
 1 half  lemon 
 1  avocado  -- preferred varieties are:  Fuerte ,  Hass , or  Anaheim . 
 oregano 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 salt 
 Directions : 
 Lightly mash  avocado  in a bowl, using a fork. 
 Add a few drops of freshly squeezed  lemon juice  to mashed  avocado . 
 Add seasoning to taste ( oregano , ground  black pepper , and  salt ). 
 Finish mashing  avocado  to blend ingredients. 
 Toast two slices of bread in toaster. 
 Apply a thick coat of the  avocado  to each slice of toast. 
 Place the two slices of " avocado  toast" in the broiler oven, and broil for two to three minutes with the door open. (The broiling time will depend on the oven and broiler setting.) 
 Visual inspection will tell when broiling has reached "perfection".
