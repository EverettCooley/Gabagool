 Wikipedia Article  About Fenel seed on Wikipedia 
 Aromatic and sweet, somewhat minty, and often fermented.
 Fennel is widely cultivated both in its native range and elsewhere of for its edible, strongly flavoured leaves and seeds. The flavour is similar to that of anise and star anise, though usually not so strong.
 Ancient Indians used fennel as a condiment and culinary spice. In Greece, it was a symbol of success. In Rome, the young fennel shoots were used as food. Pliny considered it good for improved vision. Culpeper recommends it as an antidote for poison. In India, it thrives in the sunny, limey, well-drained loam. The pleasingly warm, sweet smell and the clean appearance are clear indications of how well Indian fennel retains its exclusive quality even after drying.
