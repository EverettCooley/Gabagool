 Persimmon punch. This is the one of most popular traditional Korean drinks. It is usually drunk in winter. As an added health benefit, this drink contains lots of vitamin C.

 10  dried persimmons 
 ⅓ lb  ginger 
 ¼ oz stick  cinnamon 
 13 cups  water 
 2 cups  sugar 
 2 tbsp  pine nuts 
 Directions : 
 Remove the seeds from the dried  persimmons  and replace them with four or five  pine nuts . 
 Wash and scrape the  ginger  and slice it thinly. 
 Simmer the  ginger  and stick  cinnamon  with the  water  until the strong taste draws well. 
 Add the  sugar  and briefly boil again. 
 Pour this syrup over the dried  persimmons  in a large bowl. 
 When the  persimmons  are soft, serve them adding the syrupy liquid and sprinkling whole  pine nuts  on the top of each serving. 
 Hint: chilling the drink will give you a much better taste.
