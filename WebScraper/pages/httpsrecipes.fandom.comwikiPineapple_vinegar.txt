 About pineapple vinegar : 
 The pineapple vinegar is vinegar with a light pineapple flavour which is used in Latin American and Asian cuisines.
 It is made from the peelings from pineapples that would otherwise be discarded, in preparing them to get the canned pineapple. The pineapples need to get washed before peeling. No leaves or stems are used.
 Sugar, yeast, and water are just added to the peelings. The mixture is allowed to ferment for 8 days, covered, at room temperature.
 The vinegar will come to about 4% acid after 8 days, higher whenever left longer. It is then filtered.
