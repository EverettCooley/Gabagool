Ingredients : 
 1 to 2 frozen very ripe  bananas 
 1 to 2 tbs  malt powder 
 1 cup  rice milk  (maybe more?) 
 1 tbsp  vanilla  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Break or slice the  banana  into small chunks and put in a blender. 
 Add  malt powder . 
 Add a small amount of the  rice milk  and start to blend. 
 Add more  rice milk  as necessary until the  banana  goes from chunks to puree, then blend for another minute or two before adding the rest of the  rice milk  and optional  vanilla . 
 If you try to blend all the ingredients at once you"re likely to end up with un-blended  banana  chunks. 
 This recipe is a good way to use over-ripe  bananas , which we peel and freeze when they"ve been on the counter for a bit too long.
