 Ingredients : 
 2.85 litres pink and red  rose petals  or 60 gram dried petals 
 285 ml.  red grape  concentrate 
 900 gram  sugar 
 1 teaspoon mixed acids (citric, malic and tartaric) 
 0,5 teaspoon tannin 
 1 teaspoon  yeast  nutrient 
 activated  wine yeast , burgundy type 
 Directions : 
 Activate the  yeast  before making up the wine must. 
 Place the petals into the fermentation vessel together with the  sugar  and  grape  concentrate. 
 Add 3 litres of hot  water  and stir well with a wooden or plastic spoon to dissolve the  sugar . 
 When cool (about 21Â°C) add the other ingredients including the  wine yeast . 
 Cover the vessel and set aside in a warm place to ferment for 4 days, pressing down the petals every day with a spoon. 
 After 4 days, strain the liquor into a demijohn and if necessary, top it up with  apple juice  or cool, boiled  water . 
 Fit a bung and airlock and leave to ferment out to completion. 
 Rack from the lees when a sediment begins to form. 
 This wine is drinkable very young, but will get better if you leave it for a few months. 
 You can collect the petals daily and place them in a plastic back in the freezer until you have enough petals.
