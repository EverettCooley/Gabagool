 Description : 
 I got this recipe from the pecanbread group. My son LOVES them. They freeze 
well. and they seem healthy enough! 
 I make pancakes and I use coconut oil in my stainless steel pan.
 I made these 2 days ago, froze the extras. I microwaved 4 or 5 this morning
for my son to eat.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup almond flour (try pecan flour too!) 
 4 eggs 
 2 tbsp honey 
 1 tsp vanilla 
 pinch of salt 
 1/4 tsp baking soda 
 Directions : 
 Beat eggs. 
 Add honey and vanilla and beat until smooth. 
 Add flour, salt and baking soda and mix well. 
 Cook like pancakes or use in waffle iron.
