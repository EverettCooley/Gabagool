 Ingredients : 
 baked  tofu  - 8 oz (make your own or store bought) 
 hummus -  garlic  flavor 
 lettuce 
 tomato 
 carrots 
 cucumbers 
 wrap 
 Directions : 
 Take the wrap and lay it flat. Spread hummus on the wrap. Cut baked  tofu  in 1/4 to 1/2 strips and place it on top of the hummus. Add the rest of the ingredients and then fold it. I cut it in half due to the size of the wrap and ENJOY.
