Sparkling Sugar  is edible glitter. It is sugar crystals coloured with food grade carnauba wax added, and coloured with artificial food colours. It also comes in pure white, which has no food colour added, just the wax. The white just adds shimmer. It has a slightly higher moisture content than  granulated sugar .
