 Description : 
       Bittersweet Salad Dressing     
 Ingredients : 
 1 	cup  Mayonnaise  (Miracle Whip would give it a sweeter taste) 
 2 	cups  heavy whipping cream 
 2 	tablespoons  vinegar  (I use  apple cider vinegar , but you could also use  white vinegar ;  white vinegar  gives it more of that) 
 Directions : 
 Put  Mayonnaise  into medium sized mixing bowl.
 Pour  heavy whipping cream  into bowl with  Mayonnaise ; stir until well blended.
 Stir in  vinegar  and season to taste.
