Eggnog Fudge
 
 Ingredients : 
 1/2 cup sugar 
 3 cups miniature marshmallows 
 2/3 cup purchased eggnog 
 3 tablespoons butter 
 1 tablespoon corn syrup 
 1/8 teaspoon salt 
 1 cup (6 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips 
 1 cup chopped pecans 
 Directions : 
 Butter sides of a heavy 3-quart saucepan. Add sugar,
marshmallows, eggnog, butter, corn syrup, and salt to
the saucepan; cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
until sugar is dissolved. Turn heat up to medium and
cook until mixture boils. 
 Continue to cook, stirring constantly, to about 232 degrees .
Add chocolate chips and continue to cook for 5 minutes
(should be at soft ball stage*), or until chocolate is
melted. Stir in chopped nuts. Pour into a buttered
8-inch square pan. Cool to room temperature, then
chill and cut into squares. 
 Makes about 3 dozen pieces of eggnog fudge. 
 
 To Test for Soft Ball Stage 
 A small amount of syrup dropped into chilled water
forms a ball, but flattens when picked up with fingers
(234 to 240 degrees).
