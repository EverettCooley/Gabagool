 Ingredients : 
 3 slices tofurky or other vegan  Turkey  slice alternative 
 2 tablespoon Nayonaise 
 2 tablespoon vegan  mustard  of choice 
 1 beautiful, juicy, organic heirloom tomatoe (any color) sliced thin 
 5-10 big leaves of fresh bazil (green or purple, I use both) 
 2 slices of vegan  French bread 
 Directions : 
 Spread Nayonaise and  mustard  on vegan bread. Place  basil  leaves on one side. Place  tomatoes  on top of  basil  and then the tofurky and then the other piece of vegan bread. A hard to believe it's vegan lunch with an Italian twist. My little brother couldn't even believe it wasn't real  Turkey !
