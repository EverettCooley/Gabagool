Description : 
       Tkemali Sauce     
 Tart and spicy, tkemali is used on most grilled meats and fish and just about everywhere in Abkhazia and Georgia.
 Both Darra Goldstein and cookbook author Anya von Bremzen suggest the substitution of other kinds of unripe plums for the unobtainable tkemalis. The Georgian Feast recipe calls for Santa Anna plums. In Anya von Bremzen's, uses prune plums instead, in her recipe in her 'Please to the Table' book, an anthology of recipes from the former soviet republics, .
