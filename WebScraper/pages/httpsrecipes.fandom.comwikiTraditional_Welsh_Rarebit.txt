      Welsh Rarebit.     
 Prep Time:  10 minutes
 Cook Time:  5 minutes
 Yields:  Serves 4
 
 Description : 
 
Without a doubt, Welsh Rarebit is Wales' most famous dish. It is essentially cheese on toast with a hint of cheeky Welsh goodness. Delicious in it's simplicity.
 
 Ingredients : 
 
8oz grated, strong  cheddar 

1 tablespoon Welsh butter (salted butter)

2 teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce 

1 level teaspoon  dry mustard 

2 teaspoons  flour 

4 tablespoons Welsh beer (bitter/ale not lager)or milk
 
dash of  white pepper 

4 slices bread toasted on 1 side only
 
 Directions : 
 
Put the cheese, flour, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, butter and pepper into a saucepan. Mix well and then add the beer or milk to moisten. Be careful not to make it too wet as you'll never get it to stick to the bread. Stir the mixture over a low heat until it's melted. Once your mixture has the consistency of a thick paste, remove it from the heat and allow to cool slightly. 

While the cheese mixture is cooling, take four slices of bread and toast them on one side only. Once done, divide the mixture between the four slices of toast. Pop this back under the grill to brown. Serve immediately. 

This dish makes a great lunchtime snack, or for a more substantial meal, try serving it alongside a bowl of leek and potato soup.
