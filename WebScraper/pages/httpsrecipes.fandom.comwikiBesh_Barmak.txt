Description : 
 Kazakh & Kyrgyz national dish
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 medium sheep or 3 kilograms of  mutton  or  beef 
 1 kilogram  onions 
 4 cups of  flour 
 1  egg 
 Directions : 
 Put the meat in a large pot along with onions and boil for two hours. 
 While the meat is cooking prepare the noodles (store bought noodles can be substituted). 
 Make a pile with the flour. 
 Beat the egg and add it to the flour, then mix in warm saltwater (1-2 teaspoons) until it holds together but is not so sticky. 
 Knead well and then let stand for 10 minutes. 
 When meat is done it is removed from the water and the noodles are then boiled in the same water to give the noodles a meaty flavor - noodles only need to cook for 5 minutes or less.
