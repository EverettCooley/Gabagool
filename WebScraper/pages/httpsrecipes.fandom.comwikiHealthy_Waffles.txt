 Description : 
 I have varied the dry ingredients radically, depending on what i have around the house. When I don't have molasses, I increase the amount of honey and other liquids. No matter what I do to this recipe, it always seems to turn out great.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  rolled oats  (can be toasted first by putting thin layer in pan and baking at 350 °F for 15 – 20 minutes, or until lightly toasted) 
 1 pack rapid-rise  yeast 
 1 tbsp.  sugar 
 3 tbsp.  oat bran 
 2 tbsp.  non-fat dry milk  powder 
 ½ cup  cornmeal 
 ¾ cup  whole wheat flour 
 ¼ tbsp.  baking soda 
 3 tbsp.  wheat germ 
 ¾ cup skim  milk 
 2  egg whites 
 ¼ cup  dark molasses 
 Directions : 
 Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. 
 Heat wet ingredients until very warm (125-130 °F) and stir into the dry mixture. 
 Let the batter sit for about 20 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator. 
 Add more milk or water to alter the consistency as needed for waffles or pancakes.
