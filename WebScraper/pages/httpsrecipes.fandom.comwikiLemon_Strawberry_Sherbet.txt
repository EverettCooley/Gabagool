 Description : 
 This stone-cold dessert is made with real fruit and soy milk and is great with other meals, as it keeps a juicy aroma with the fruits. Evaporated milk rarely replaces the soy milk and works for this, too.
 
 Ingredients : 
 juice of 3  lemons 
 1 cup  strawberries 
 4 cups  soy milk 
 4 fresh  mint  sprigs 
 Directions : 
 Mix all the ingredients then except the  mint  in an 8-inch-square baking pan. 
 The  soy milk  may look curdled, but this will disappear by freezing. Cover and freeze until partially frozen, approximately 2 hours. 
 Scrape down the sides of the pan and stir the partially frozen mixture with a spoon. 
 Cover and return to the freezer until firm. 
 Scoop the sherbet into serving dishes, garnish with the  mint , and serve immediately.
