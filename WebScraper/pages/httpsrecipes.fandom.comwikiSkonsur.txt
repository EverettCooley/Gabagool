Description : 
       Skonsur - Thick pancakes-pan-fried bread     
 The word "skonsa" (the singular form of "skonsur") is the same word as "scone" in English. We Icelanders use the word to refer to a kind of thick pancake. The taste is similar to American breakfast pancakes, but we serve them differently. 
 Serve them cold with any kind of topping that is good with bread:  cheese , slices of meat, salads, etc. 
or make a sandwich-cake: make a  mayonnaise / sour cream -based salad ( shrimp ,  tuna ,  egg ,  salmon , etc.), and layer with whole pancakes.
