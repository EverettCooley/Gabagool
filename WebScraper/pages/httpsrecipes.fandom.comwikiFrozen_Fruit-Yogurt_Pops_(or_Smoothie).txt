Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 qt.  vanilla   yogurt 
 Directions : 
 Divide into several 1 cup servings and freeze to be used as needed. 
 (Any time we buy  bananas  and 1 or 2 get beyond our preference, I just peel the  banana , cut it in 3-4 pieces and place in a container in the freezer.) 
 (Any ripe fruit or fruit salad that may have lost some visual appeal also place in container in freezer. 
 I use 1 container as a fruit catchall. 
 If my son doesn't finish an  Apple  and it gets slightly brown or if I make a huge summer fruit salad and the next day it doesn't look very pretty I freeze it or make fruit pops or smoothies today.) 
 Tupperware popsicle molds or small paper cups and popsicle sticks 
 The day you wish to make these, take your blender out, a small container of  yogurt  and the ripe frozen fruit from the freezer. 
 Break the  yogurt  into 2-4 pieces with a knife - be careful. Place in blender. 
 Add some  pineapple juice  and blend. (Add enough liquid to your own preference.) 
 Place 4-6 chunks of frozen  banana  or less  banana  with some other fruit. 
 I've even added  applesauce . Add more  pineapple juice  if necessary. 
 Spin it together. 
 Fill up popsicle molds first. 
 Serve the rest as a nutritious smoothie.
