 Description : 
 Orange salad. Comment from Sally: pico de gallo (pee-coh day guy-yoh) translates as the bite of the rooster. I assume that is because the salsa (which merely means "sauce") called pico de gallo is quite fiery and has a fierce bite to it. Having never been bitten by a rooster, however, i can only offer this as conjecture. (grin).
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup thinly sliced  red onion 
 1 cup peeled, julienne-cut  jícama 
 5 cup loosely packed torn  romaine  or red-tip  lettuce  leaves 
 2 cup peeled, sliced navel  oranges 
 ¼ cup  walnut  or  almond  roughly chopped, (optional) 
 Dressing : 
 ¼ cup fresh  orange juice 
 1 tbsp fresh  lime juice 
 1½ tbsp  honey 
 ½ tbsp  cumin 
 ½ tbsp  red chile powder 
 ½ tbsp  salt 
 2 tbsp finely mined  cilantro 
 Directions : 
 Whisk together all dressing ingredients - drizzle half the dressing over the  onions  and  jícama , refrigerate for at least an hour - just before serving, remove onions and  jícama  from marinade and toss with the  lettuce . 
 Arrange  oranges  on top and drizzle the remaining dressing over the salad. 
 (Optional) sprinkle the  nuts  on top.
