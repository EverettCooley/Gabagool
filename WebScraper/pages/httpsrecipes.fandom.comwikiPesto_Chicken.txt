 Description : 
 This golden, baked edition of the chicken is made and mixed with pesto for glorious, colorful taste. You can make this with other spices in a chicken and pesto if you want on other occasions, while it then keeps a luxurious taste with the poultry.
 
 Ingredients : 
 5 peeled  garlic  cloves 
 ½ cup shelled  walnuts 
 spinach  leaves 
 3 basil leaves 
 ½ cup crumbled  feta cheese 
 4  chicken  breasts, thighs, or legs 
 1 beaten  egg 
 1 cup seasoned  breadcrumbs 
 Directions : 
 Pulse on your small food processor or processor attachment on a blender, then fill the food processor to the top with washed and dried  spinach  leaves and pulse until blended twice. 
 Add ½ cup crumbled  feta   cheese , and basil leaves, and pulse until it is a thick paste. 
 Pound the  chicken  breasts, thighs, or legs with the tenderizer until only thin, but not torn, and spread 1-2 tablespoons of pesto on middle of breast half. 
 Roll into the plastic wrap square for each breast, thigh, or leg and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Then dredge in 1 beaten  egg  and coat with seasoned breadcrumbs. 
 Fry in ½ cup hot  oil  on both sides until golden brown (about 7 minutes). 
 Bake in a heated oven at 350° F, uncovered about 35 minutes until the  chicken  is 160° C or opaque in the middle. 
 Let rest while you set the table and light the candles, or make a hollandaise sauce. Serve hot and plain with the homemade pesto. 
 Notes : 
 Instead of the homemade pesto, add 4 tablespoons store-bought pesto sauce to the pounded chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.
