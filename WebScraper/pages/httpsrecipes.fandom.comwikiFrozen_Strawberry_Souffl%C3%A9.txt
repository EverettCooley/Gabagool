Ingredients : 
 1 lbs  powdered sugar  (confectioner's) 
 8  egg whites 
 1½ lbs  whipping cream 
 2 lbs fresh  strawberries 
 ⅓ cup  water 
 silicon or wax paper 
 Directions : 
 Wash and clean the  strawberries . 
 Transfer to a blender or food processor, then blend to make a fine  strawberry  puree. 
 In a saucepan, dissolve  powdered sugar  in  water . 
 Bring to a quick boil, then cook over low heat for about 1 minute. 
 Let it cool. 
 In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the eggwhites until snowy and stiff. 
 Carefully fold into the  Sugar  mixture. 
 Mix well. 
 In another large bowl, use the electric mixer to whip the  cream  until thick. 
 Fold into the sugar-eggwhite mixture. 
 Fold in the  strawberry  puree and mix well. 
 Grease the sides of souffle dishes with some  butter . 
 Now, wrap a silicon paper around the upper part of the dish (or cup) and secure it with a tape. 
 This is to allow the souffle to go over the dish. (for an authentic souffle effect!) 
 Pour the  strawberry  souffle mixture into the souffle dishes, filling it up until it reaches the top of the paper. (for a better idea, observe the shape of the souffle in the picture) freeze overnight. 
 To serve, remove the silicon paper, then remove from the mold. 
 Arrange on dessert plates and garnish with  strawberries  (optional).
