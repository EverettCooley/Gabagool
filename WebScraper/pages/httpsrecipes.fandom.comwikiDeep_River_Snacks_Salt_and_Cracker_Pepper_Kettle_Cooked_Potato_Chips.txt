Description : 
 According to the website for  Deep River Snacks  these chips are made using thicky sliced grade A  potatoes  which are cooked in natural oil. The chips contain no  cholesterol ,  MSG , artificial flavors, artificial presevatives or trans fats.
 Taquitos.net  describes these potato chips as having more crunch than "your average kettle-cooked potato chips" (such as those made by  Cape Cod ). The seasoning is supposedly "tasty, but not that peppery." Overall, the chips were deemed pretty good, but the Taquitos staff has tasted better salt & pepper potato chips.
