Ingredients
 
 Cake: 
 2 tablespoons (28 grams) all-vegetable shortening 
 1 cup (113 grams) finely chopped pecans 
 1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, softened 
 1¾ cups (350 grams) granulated sugar 
 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
 4 large eggs 
 2¼ cups (281 grams) all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon (5 grams) baking powder 
 ¾ cup dark corn syrup 
 ½ cup whole buttermilk 
 Drizzle: 
 ½ cup (110 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar 
 ¼ cup (57 grams) unsalted butter 
 2 tablespoons half-and-half 
 Pinch kosher salt 
 Instructions
 
 Preheat oven to 325°F. 
 For cake: Grease a 10-cup Bundt pan with shortening. Sprinkle pecans in pan, and swirl pan to coat. Leave remaining pecans in bottom of pan. 
 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, and vanilla at medium speed until fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes, stopping to scrape sides of bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
 In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and baking powder. In a small bowl, stir together corn syrup and buttermilk. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture, beating just until combined after each addition. Spoon batter into prepared pan. 
 Bake until a wooden pick inserted near center comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack, and let cool for 30 minutes. 
 For drizzle: In a small saucepan, bring brown sugar, butter, half-and-half, and salt to a boil. Remove from heat, and slowly drizzle over warm cake.
