NEAPOLITAN POTATO SALAD
 
  Courtesy: Ms. Tarla Dalal
 
 
The Neapolitan style of cooking is characterised by the famous piazzaiola sauce. It consists of peeled, chopped and deseeded tomatoes, garlic, basil or marjoram and olive oil. It is served with pasta, grilled dishes and pizzas.
Cooked potatoes with deseeded tomatoes, the Neapolitan way are a favourite Italian salad. This salad is like the one served in Naples which goes well as an accompaniment to a burger and is delicious just by itself.
Chill this salad thoroughly before serving!

 SPAGHETTI WITH EGGPLANT PARMIGIANNA
                        
 
 
 
 
 This famous pasta dish comes from Parma in Italy.
Spaghetti tossed in a chilli cream sauce topped with cheese filled eggplants and the famous Italian tomato sauce. It makes a harmonious blend of flavours. 
When selecting eggplants, look for those that are heavy for their size, and have a smooth, shiny and deep purple skin.
Toss the spaghetti in the chilli cream sauce just before serving, as it doesn't taste as good when it is reheated. Warm the dish in an oven if the eggplant slices have turned cold. Enjoy it hot and, of course, freshly prepared.
