 About Triple sec : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Triple sec on Wikipedia 
 Triple sec is a colourless, orange-flavoured liqueur used in thousands of mixed drinks and recipes as a sweetening and flavouring agent. The orange flavour comes from the dried peels of prematurely-picked oranges that grow natively on the island of Cura√ßao, and tend to be more bitter than other oranges. The peels then macerate in alcohol to disperse the flavour.
 This liqueur is well known for its use in making margarita cocktails.
