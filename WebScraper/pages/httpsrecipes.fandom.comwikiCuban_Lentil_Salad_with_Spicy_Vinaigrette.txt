Ingredients : 
 6 cups  water 
 1½ tbsp coarse  sea salt 
 1½ cups  lentils  rinsed, picked over 
 5 tbsp extra-virgin  olive oil 
 4 large  garlic  cloves cut into slivers 
 ½ tsp ground  cumin 
 ½ tsp ground  coriander 
 1 tsp  cayenne pepper 
 1 tsp  salt 
 ¼ cup  white wine vinegar 
 4  green onions , white, light green parts sliced thin diagonal 
 ¼ cup finely-diced  jícama 
 fresh  parsley  sprigs for garnish 
 lemon  wedges for garnish 
 Directions : 
 In a large pot, bring the  water  to a boil and add the  salt . 
 Add the  lentils , reduce the heat to low, and cook covered for 30 minutes. 
 The  lentils  should be tender but not mushy. 
 Take care not to overcook them or they can fall apart. 
 While the  lentils  are cooking, in a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the  olive oil  over medium-low heat. 
 Add the  garlic  and cook gently for 5 to 6 minutes, or until softened and just slightly golden. 
 Do not allow to brown. 
 Remove from the heat and add the  cumin , coriander,  cayenne , and  salt . 
 Stir in the  vinegar  and then transfer the mixture to a large serving bowl. 
 Drain the  lentils  in a colander, and immediately transfer them to the bowl. 
 Toss together until the  lentils  are evenly coated with the dressing, then drizzle the remaining 4 tablespoons of  olive oil  over the top and toss again just to mix. 
 Cool to room temperature, stir in the scallions and  jícama , and serve immediately, or refrigerate for 1 or 2 hours, to allow the flavors to marry. 
 Garnish with sprigs of  parsley  and  lemon  wedges.
