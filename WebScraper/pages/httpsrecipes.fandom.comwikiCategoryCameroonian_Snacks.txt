 Honey Peanuts are delicious and very popular all over Central Africa. First, you make sugar syrup in a saucepan. Next, you add the peanuts and cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, until peanuts are evenly coated, and no syrup is left in pan. You bake the nuts at 300 degrees F for about 30 minutes to 1 hour until the sugar is completely dried.
