 About French bread : 
 Wikipedia Article  Bread About French bread on Wikipedia 
 A light, crusty, yeast-raised bread made with water instead of milk. The dark brown, intensely crisp crust is created by brushing or spraying the loafs exterior with water during the baking process. French bread comes in many shapes, including the classic long, thin Baguette, rounds and fat ovals.
 The best known French bread is baguette. It is bread that has been formed into a long, narrow cylindrical loaf. Usually has a crisp brown crust and light, chewy interior.
