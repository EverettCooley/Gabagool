 Makes 20 pigs-in-blankets. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  all-purpose flour 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 ¼ teaspoon  baking soda 
 ¼ teaspoon  salt 
 3 tablespoons toasted  wheat germ 
 ¼ cup chilled  vegetable shortening 
 ⅓ cup  buttermilk  or plain  yogurt 
 1 large  egg yolk 
 10  frankfurters , ends trimmed and frankfurters halved crosswise 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375°F and grease a large baking sheet. 
 In a bowl, whisk together  flour ,  baking powder ,  baking soda ,  salt  and  wheat germ . 
 Blend in  shortening  with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. 
 In a small bowl whisk together  buttermilk  or  yogurt  and yolk and stir into  flour  mixture, stirring until mixture just forms a moist dough. 
 Knead dough 4 times on a floured surface and with a floured rolling pin roll out into a 12-inch square. 
 Cut dough into 1½-inch-wide strips and roll a strip around middle of a frankfurter until dough just overlaps. 
 Cut Pig-in-Blanket free from strip and make 19 more Pigs-in-Blankets in same manner, arranging them, seam sides down, as they are made on prepared baking sheet. (Pigs-in-Blankets may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.) 
 Bake Pigs-in-Blankets in upper third of oven until pale golden, about 15 minutes.
