 Ingredients : 
 1 package  active dry yeast 
 150ml/5fl.oz. Warm  milk 
 Approx 175g/6oz  plain flour 
 50g/2oz  Sugar 
 A pinch of  salt 
 1 large  egg , lightly beaten 
 2-1/2 tbsp  butter , melted 
 Directions : 
 1. Place the  milk  in a small bowl, sprinkle the  yeast  over the top and leave for about 5 minutes until foamy. Stir well. 
 2. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the dry ingredients with a whisk then make a well in the centre and pour in the  egg ,  yeast  mixture, and  butter . Gradually work the  flour  into the liquid ingredients until you have a smooth, soft dough. 
 3. If necessary, add a little more  flour  to make a dough that does not stick to your fingers and can be rolled out easily. Do not knead or over work or it will become tough. 
 4. Form the dough into a ball, place in a large lightly oiled bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for about 1 hour until doubled in size.
 5.  butter  the flan tin and coat with  flour , shaking off any excess. Set aside.
 6. Punch down the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface and using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a round, about 6mm/1/4-inch thick. 
 7. Line the prepared flan tin with the pastry, trim the edges and prick holes on the base with a fork. 
 8. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and leave the dough to rest and rise again for 20 minutes before filling and baking.
