Description : 
 A quick, high-energy fresh fruit salad for the busy person. It relies more on temperate than tropical fruits, especially those available throughout the year. It provides a non-fat meal, which has become a favourite for athletes and sports persons of all ages. Although dried fruits are used in this recipe, weight-conscious people need have little concern as long as they are active; if not, they should replace the dried fruits as indicated. This fruit salad is ideal for breakfast or lunch, but it is too energising for the evening meal, unless you intend a late and exciting night.
 This fruit salad is delicious alone, but a topping of Penguin Ice Cream will make it even more delectable and certainly richer.
