 About Sweet rice flour : 
 Mochiko (sweet rice flour) is made from sweet rice, also known as glutinous rice. Despite its name, this rice has no gluten. It is called mifen (Chinese: 米粉; pinyin: mǐ fěn) in Chinese, galapong in Ilokano/Filipino and pirinç unu in Turkish. The flour is principally starch, plus a small amount of protein. The starch is waxy and makes an excellent gel.
 Rice flour made from a short-grained, glutinous rice known as Mochi. Common in Asia, mochiko flour is often used to thicken sauces and food mixes, providing a strong bonding that can withstand refrigerator and freezer temperatures without separating. Mochiko is often used for breading foods prior to frying and for making traditional foods that require flour, such as desserts and baked goods, or rice dumplings referred to as Japanese mochi. Mochiko flour is also known as sweet glutinous rice flour, sweet rice flour or mochi flour.
