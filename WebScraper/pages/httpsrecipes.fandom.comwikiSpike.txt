 About Spike : 
 Spike seasoning refers to a brand of seasoning, originally created by Gayelord Hauser and now manufactured by Modern Products, Inc. and sold under the Gayelord Hauser name. Spike seasoning comes in several varieties, but the original Spike seasoning blend contains 39 different herbs, spices and vegetables, including salt, nutritional yeast, hydrolyzed vegetable protein -- a form of MSG. Because of the number of ingredients, Spike seasoning can be difficult to replicate or replace.
