The mango originated in Southeast Asia where it has been grown for over 4,000 years. Over the years mango groves have spread to many parts of the tropical and sub-tropical world, where the climate allows the mango to grow best. Mango trees are evergreens that will grow to 60 feet tall. The mango tree will fruit 4 to 6 years after planting. Mango trees require hot, dry periods to set and produce a good crop. Today there are over 1,000 different varieties of mangos throughout the world. 
 Mangos are an excellent source of vitamins A and C, as well as a good source of potassium and bets carotene. Mangoes are high in fiber, but low in calories (approx. 110 per average mango). Fat, (only 1 gram), and sodium. The mango tree plays a sacred role in India. It is a symbol of love and some believe that the mango tree can grant wishes. 
 Haiti grows and exports over 2.5 million cases of Mango Francis each year, with the USA getting most of them. The Hatian mango, also called the Francis, is a unique variety, available only from Haiti.
