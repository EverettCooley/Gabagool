Description : 
 In the center of Canada's flag is a red maple leaf-a symbol of Canada's many maple trees. No wonder everyone likes to turn out in the early spring to help collect the sweet liquid from the sugar maples. The snow is still on the ground. The sap is gathered and boiled down into  maple syrup . As a special treat, the hot syrup is poured over fresh snow. With  cider  and doughnuts, cups of sweet maple snow make festive refreshments at a sugaring-off party.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup of clean snow  or  1 tray of  ice  cubes 
 Â½ cup  maple syrup 
 Equipment : 
 pan or bowl 
 measuring cup 
 saucepan 
 4 small paper cups 
 tablespoon 
 Directions : 
 Fill a pan with snow. Be sure it is clean. 
 Have all your ingredients ready before you bring in the snow, so it doesn't have time to melt. If there isn't any snow, make crushed  ice . An easy way to do this is wrap a few cubes of  ice  at time in a kitchen towel and pound them with a heavy object, such as a rolling pin. Put the crushed ice in a bowl. Continue until all the cubes are crushed. 
 Heat the  maple syrup  in the saucepan over low heat for about two minutes until it is warm. 
 Remove it from the heat. 
 Fill each paper cup with enough snow or  ice  to make a rounded top. 
 Drop a tablespoon or more of  maple syrup  on top of the snow or  ice . 
 Note: you can use either pure  maple syrup  or  maple-flavored syrup  for this recipe.
