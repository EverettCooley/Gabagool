 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 Tbsp.  fenugreek seeds 
 1/2 tsp.  tomato  puree 
 3 cups  Chicken  or  beef stock 
 2 loaves saluf bread (see following recipe) or pita 
 juice of 2  lemons 
 Directions : 
 Soak the  fenugreek seeds  in  water  for 3 hours. Drain the seeds well and grind them finely. Add the  tomato  puree and 1 Tbsp. of  water  and blend together well. Place the mixture over a low flame and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove immediately from the heat and set aside. 
 Heat the stock and add the  fenugreek  mixture. Over a medium flame, bring just to a boil, stirring constantly. If the soup becomes overly thick, add more stock. As soon as a boil is attained, remove from the heat. To serve, divide the breads into equal portions and place one portion in each soup bowl. Pour the hot soup over the bread, add the  lemon juice  and serve at once. 
 Serves 4-6.
