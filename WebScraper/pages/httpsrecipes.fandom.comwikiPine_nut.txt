 About Pine nut : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Pine nut on Wikipedia 
 Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pine trees (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of value as a human food.
 Pine nuts are small, ivory-colored seeds extracted from the cones of a species of pine tree. They are appreciated for their rich, slightly resinous flavor. Pine nuts are used whole as an ingredient or a garnish, or are puréed as a thickener.
 Also called pignolia, pignon or piñon, these tiny, oval, creamy white nuts are found in the cones of some varieties of pine trees. They are removed by roasting the pine cones and are used in a variety of foods from cookies to pesto sauce.
