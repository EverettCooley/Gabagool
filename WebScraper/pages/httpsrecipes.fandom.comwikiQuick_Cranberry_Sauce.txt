 Serves 6 to 8 
 Ingredients : 
 4 cups (16 oz) fresh or frozen  cranberries 
 1½ cups  apple jelly  or  orange marmalade  (about 1½ twelve oz jars) 
 ⅓ to ½ cup  sugar 
 ¼ tsp grated  orange zest  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 In a medium pan, over medium high heat, combine the cranberries, jelly or marmalade, ¼ cup water, sugar (⅓ cup if using jelly, ½ cup if using marmalade) and zest, if using. 
 Bring to a boil. 
 Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens, 7 to 10 minutes. 
 The marmalade version will stay a bit runny. 
 Remove from heat; let cool. 
 Transfer to a dish, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
