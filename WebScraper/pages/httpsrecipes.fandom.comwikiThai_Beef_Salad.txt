       Thai Beef Salad     
 Ingredients : 
 1 teaspoon  chili flakes , finely chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed into a paste 
 3 tablespoons fresh  lime juice   or   lemon juice 
 1 tablespoon  fish sauce 
 ½ teaspoon  sugar 
 1 small  red onion , sliced into thin rings 
 2 stalks  lemongrass , bruised and chopped (optional) 
 100 g  green beans , trimmed 
 ½ small  cucumber , peeled 
 20 small  cherry tomatoes , halved 
 20 red seedless  grapes 
 ¼ cup fresh  mint 
 ¼ cup fresh  coriander 
 300 g  sirloin steak 
 1 tablespoon  vegetable oil 
 Directions : 
 Mix the  chili flakes  and  garlic  together. 
 Mix in the  lime  or  lemon juice ,  fish sauce ,  sugar , sliced  lemongrass  and  red onions . 
 Boil the  beans  in a pot of  water  for just for a couple minutes. 
 Rinse in cool  water  and drain. 
 Cut the  cucumber  in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. 
 Cut into half-moon shapes. 
 Mix the  beans ,  tomatoes ,  cucumber ,  grapes  and most of the herbs together in a salad bowl. 
 Heat up a frying pan or griddle until very hot. 
 Smear the meat with  oil  on both sides and cook for 2-4 minutes on each side. 
 This will leave a bit of pink in the middle. 
 If you want it well done, adjust the cooking time as necessary. 
 Let the meat rest for five minutes before slicing, then lay it on a work surface and slice it thinly on a slant. 
 Spoon most of the dressing mixture you prepared earlier over the salad. 
 Slide the  steak  slices through a bit of the remaining dressing, then arrange it over the salad. 
 Decorate with the leftover herbs and serve.
