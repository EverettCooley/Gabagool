 Description : 
 Thit Bo Vien  are Vietnamese  Beef  balls. They can be added to any noodle soup or other main dishes. Ground beef replaces the beef shank and always works for this, too. 
 
       Beef Balls     
 Ingredients : 
 1 ¼ cup Vietnamese  fish sauce 
 1 tablespoon  potato starch 
 1 teaspoon  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon  sugar , white only 
 1 teaspoon chili powder 
 ¼ teaspoon black  pepper 
 1 teaspoon salt 
 2 lbs.  beef  shank  or  (3 lbs. ground beef) 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 1 teaspoon  oil 
 Directions : 
 Boil a big pot of water or broth. 
 Cut meat into chunks and grind the meat in a food processor. Partially frozen meat will be ground better. 
 Mix the rest of the ingredients, one at time slowly, while grinding the meat to ensure it is mixed up well with the meat. 
 Keep grinding until you get a very fine paste without lumps and grits. 
 Roll the paste into a ball and drop into the boiling water or broth. 
 When the balls surface to the top, then they are done. Take them out. 
 They can be enjoyed right away or frozen for later use. Wrap the homemade meatballs with the aluminium foil in a baking sheet but reserve this in the freezer. 
 Notes : 
 To replace the beef shank or any other kind of beef, use the ground beef to prepare for mixing with the same rest of the ingredients.
