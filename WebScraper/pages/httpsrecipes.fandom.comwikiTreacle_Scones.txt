 ½ teaspoon ground  cinnamon 
 2 tablespoons  black treacle  or  molasses 
 1 pinch  salt 
 5 fluid ounces  milk , to mix

 Heat oven to 425°F or gas mark 7 and grease a baking sheet. 
 Sift the  flour  and  salt  into a bowl and rub in the  butter . 
 Mix in the  sugar  and  cinnamon . 
 Add the  treacle  or  molasses  and sufficient  milk  to make soft dough.
