Description : 
       Rúllupylsa     
 Rolled sausage. this is a good way of using up cuts of meat that are often considered inferior because of their high fat content. This  Sausage  is generally used as a topping for bread
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 kg  mutton ,  pork  or  beef  bellies, and fatty scraps of meat.  Mutton  or  pork  is best. 
 2 – 3 tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  saltpeter  (optional) 
 1 tsp  sugar 
 1 tsp  ginger 
 ½ tsp ground  pepper 
 1 tbsp  onion , finely chopped 
 Directions : 
 Wash and dry the bellies. 
 If they contain ribs, remove them. 
 Beat with a meat hammer to soften. 
 Cut the bellies into a regular shape, large enough to roll up. 
 Cut the rest up in strips. 
 Rub the spices on one side of the bellies and arrange the meat strips on top. 
 Roll up the bellies tightly, taking care to obtain an even thickness. 
 Hold together with a fork or some toothpicks, and sew closed with twine. 
 Start at the middle and work towards the ends. 
 Truss up with more twine. 
 Rub with a mixture of  salt  and  saltpeter , 3 tbsp  salt  and 1 tbsp  saltpeter . 
 Preserve by freezing, salting or smoking (leave out the  onion  and use less spice if smoking). 
 Cook for 1½ to 3 hours, depending on size. 
 The  sausage  is done when it can be easily pierced through with a pin (use a slender knitting pin). 
 When it's done, it should be pressed - place on a cutting board, put another cutting board on top and weigh down with something heavy. 
 Keep it pressed until cold. 
 Cut into thin slices and serve on bread.
