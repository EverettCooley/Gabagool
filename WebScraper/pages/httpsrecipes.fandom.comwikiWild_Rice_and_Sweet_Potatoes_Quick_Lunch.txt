Description : 
 Contributed by Valerie Haecky.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup cooked  wild rice 
 1 cup cooked  basmati rice 
 1 to 2 uncooked  sweet potatoes , cut into Â½ inch pieces 
 1 to 2 tbsp fresh chopped  parsley 
 salt  to taste (I put quite a bit for this dish.) 
 Directions : 
 Fill into plastic lunch box. 
 Mix for cooking. 
 Nuke for 10 minutes on high. 
 Note: this can also be made using a pre-cooked  sweet potato . 
 Then the nuke time is reduced to 3 minutes for reheating. 
 Variation : 
 I think this would be good with a couple of table spoons of  orange juice  for extra flavoring added before cooking.
