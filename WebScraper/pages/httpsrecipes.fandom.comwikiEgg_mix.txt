Powdered whole eggs are another alternative to fresh eggs and are convenient to use and store. They can be used for most types of egg dishes or recipes requiring eggs. The powder is simply blended with water to produce liquid eggs, which are then used just like fresh eggs. Powdered egg products are pasteurized and do not require refrigeration, making them safe to use and easy to store.
