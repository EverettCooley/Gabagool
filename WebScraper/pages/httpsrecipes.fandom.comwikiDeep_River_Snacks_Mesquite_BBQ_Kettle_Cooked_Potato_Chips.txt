 Description : 
 These kettle-cooked  potato chips  from the  Old Lyme Gourmet Company  were described by snack website  taquitos.net  as being OK but nothing spectacular. Specifically, the review said that the chips were "very crunchy and just somewhat crisp, with not a whole lot of barbeque flavor."
 According to the website for  Deep River Snacks  these chips are made using thickly sliced grade A  potatoes  which are cooked in natural oil. The chips contain no  cholesterol ,  MSG , artificial flavors, artificial preservatives or trans fats.
