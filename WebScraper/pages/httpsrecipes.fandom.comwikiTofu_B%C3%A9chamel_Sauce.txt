Ingredients : 
 2 tbsp dairy-free  margarine  (or extra-virgin  olive oil ) 
 2½ tbsp  unbleached flour  (use slightly less if you don't want it too thick) 
 Blended mixture : 
 1 cup  soy milk 
 ½ cup extra-firm  silken tofu  or medium- firm tofu , crumbled 
 ½ cup  water 
 enough flavorful  veggie boullion  or powder for 1 cup of liquid 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 a large pinch each of freshly-grated  nutmeg  and  white pepper 
 Directions : 
 Blend all blended ingredients in a blender except for the  nutmeg  and  white pepper  until very smooth (a minute or so). 
 Melt the  margarine  in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, whisking in the  flour  to get a roux but before it starts to change color. 
 Scrape the roux into the blender and blend to mix for a few seconds. 
 Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and stir over medium-high heat until it thickens and boils. 
 Simmer on low for a few minutes, whisking in  nutmeg  and  white pepper .
