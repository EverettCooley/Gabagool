 About Flax seed : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Flax seed on Wikipedia 
 The seeds produce a vegetable oil known as  linseed oil  or  flaxseed oil . It is one of the oldest commercial oils and solvent-processed flax seed oil has been used for centuries as a drying oil in painting and varnishing. The seeds are edible, and cold pressed linseed oil is suitable for human consumption; it is one of the most concentrated plant sources of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid, and its use as a nutritional supplement is increasing. Brown and yellow flax have equal amounts of omega-3 except for a type of yellow flax called solin which is very low in omega-3 and has a completely different oil profile.
 Though the most universal function of flax seed is to produce linseed oil (commonly used in paints, varnishes, linoleums and inks), this tiny seed contains several essential nutrients including calcium, iron, niacin, phosphorous and vitamin E. It's also a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids. It has a mild nutty flavor and is often used simply sprinkled over hot dishes such as cooked cereal or stir-fries.
 
 Golden flax seed : 
 Brown Flax can be eaten, however it is grown for the commercial Linseed Oil, paint, and solvents Industries. The Omega Golden Flax Seed was developed for human consumption and is preferred for the food market because of its nutty-buttery flavour. The nutritional value of golden flaxseed vs. brown flaxseed is very similar if the samples are of the same quality. Quality is very important in determining the omega-3, 6 content and overall nutritional values.
