Description : 
 Barbequed sausages
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 grams finely  ground fatty pork 
 500 grams finely  ground veal  or  lamb 
 1 large  onion , finely chopped  or  grated 
 Â½ cup finely chopped  parsley 
 2 tsp  salt 
 250 g  panna ( caul fat  from pig) 
 Directions : 
 Combine  pork  with  veal  or  lamb ,  onion ,  parsley ,  salt  and a generous grinding of  black pepper . 
 Dip panna into a bowl of warm  water  for a minute or two, remove and carefully open out a piece at a time, laying it out flat on work surface. 
 Cut with kitchen scissors into pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square. 
 Take a good tablespoon of meat mixture and shape into a thick  sausage  about 5 cm (2 inches) long. 
 Place towards one edge of piece of panna, fold end and sides over meat and roll up firmly. 
 Repeat with remaining ingredients. 
 Thread sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them. 
 Number on each skewer depends on their length. 
 Cook over glowing charcoal, turning frequently. 
 Do not place too close to heat as sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well cooked and the outside nicely browned without being burnt. 
 The panna melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavour. 
 Excessive flaring of fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of  water  on the coals. 
 Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a main course.
