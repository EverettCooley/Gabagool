 About Candied fruit : 
 Candied fruit has been around since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.
 The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.
 In 2011  statistics showed that some 16% of U.S. households preferred buying processed fruits. 
 Fruits which are commonly candied include dates, cherries, pineapple, and ginger.
