 About Rosa Bianca eggplant : 
 The Rosa Bianca eggplants are a mild and tender specie of eggplants, which has a creamy ivory base and pink and purple stripes on the round or teardrop-shaped fruit. The color of the eggplant varies a lot, starting from white with pale pinks, cyclamen and bright purple or striped lavender with creamy parts â€“ the Rosa Bianca eggplant really represents an explosion of color. The flesh of this kind of eggplant is creamy and delicate, without sweetness or sourness. The fruit of the eggplant is rather small, around 7 inches and the flesh is found in an alabaster color. 
 This specie of eggplants (called scientifically solanum melogena) is most popular in Italy, where it grows, where it is included in special meals, like the stuffed eggplant with garlic or the Italian sausage with pecorino Romano. Very often, this kind of eggplants are included in the eggplant lasagna or in the eggplant casserole, which is prepared with thin sliced eggplants, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, grated Italian cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, sugar, garlic cloves, sweet basil, olive oil and parsley.
