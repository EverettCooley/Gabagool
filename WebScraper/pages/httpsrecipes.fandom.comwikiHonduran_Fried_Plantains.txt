 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 black, or ripened  plantain 
 1/4"  corn  or  soybean oil 
 Directions : 
 Cut the  banana  in half. Don't peel yet. 
 Cut each 1/2 lengthwise.  You now have quartered the  plantain  into four equal, narrow, relatively flat pieces. 
 Now peel the  plantain , more by pulling it off with your knife than peeling per se. 
 Heat 1/4"  corn  or  soybean oil  in a pan. 
 Put the  plantain  in the  oil  when the  oil  has reached a medium-high temperature.  If  oil  smokes, turn it down. 
 Turn the  plantain  when the natural sugars in the fruit begin to carmelize (just starting to turn brown) - about 6 minutes 
 Fry the other side - about 5 minutes 
 Place fried  plantains  on paper towels to remove extra  oil
