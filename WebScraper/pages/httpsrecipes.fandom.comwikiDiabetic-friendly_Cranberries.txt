Description : 
 I've adjusted the cooking procedure a bit to account for using Splenda instead of real sugar. Splenda will not boil down to a syrup and too much water would evaporate making this the traditional way, which required the sugar and water to be boiled for 5 minutes before adding the cranberries. 
 Also, my mother-in-law used 2 cups of sugar in her berries and the Ocean Spray package calls for only 1 cup. If you only have granulated Splenda, you'll probably want to use only 1 cup to save on a lot of carbs. I used a 2-cup equivalent of liquid Splenda and the berries are still nicely tart. I was tempted to simmer a little orange peel along with the cranberries, but I was making them to take to the in-laws for Thanksgiving and decided it was best to stick to tradition 
this time.
