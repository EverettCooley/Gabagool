 Wikipedia Article  About Soursop on Wikipedia 
 The Soursop, Guanábana, Graviola, Coração-da-Índia or Corossol (Annona muricata) is a broadleaf flowering evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, Central and South America, from Brazil north to the West Indies. It is a distant relative of the pawpaw. The plant is grown as a commercial crop for its 20-30 cm long prickly green fruit, which can weigh up to 2.5 kg.
 The flesh of the fruit consists of an edible white pulp and a core of undigestible black seeds. The species is the only member of genus Annona which is suitable for processing and preservation. The sweet pulp is used to make juice as well as candies, sorbets and ice cream flavorings.
 Nutritionally, the fruit is high in carbohydrates, particularly fructose. The fruit also contains significant amounts of vitamin C, vitamin B1, and vitamin B2. The fruit, seeds, and leaves have a number of herbal medicinal uses among indigenous peoples of regions where the plant is common.
 The Soursop is adapted to areas of high humidity and relatively warm winters, temperatures below 5 °C will cause damage to leaves and small branches, and temperatures below 3 °C can be fatal. There is some limited production as far north as southern Florida within USDA zone 10; however these are mostly garden plantings for local consumption. The Soursop will reportedly fruit as a container specimen, even in temperate climates if protected from cool temperatures.
