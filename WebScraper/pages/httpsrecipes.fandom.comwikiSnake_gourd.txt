 Wikipedia Article  About Snake gourd on Wikipedia 
 Trichosanthes cucumerina is a tropical or subtropical vine, raised for its strikingly long fruit, used as a vegetable and for medicine. Other names include snake gourd, serpent gourd, chichinga, and padwal.
 The narrow, soft-skinned fruit can reach 150 cm long. Its soft, bland, somewhat mucilaginous flesh is similar to that of the luffa and the calabash. It is most popular in the cuisine of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The shoots, tendrils, and leaves are also eaten as greens. Padwal is also the lowest cast, in the cast system of India specifically in punjab.
