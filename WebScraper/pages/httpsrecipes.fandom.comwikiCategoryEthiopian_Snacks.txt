 Ethiopian snack foods are, for the most part, very similar. As injera, a native flat bread very similar to sourdough, is the cornerstone of any traditional Ethiopian meal, extra pieces of this local delight are often used as a snack food item. Generally, bits of injera are combined with honey, vegetables, yogurt, or cottage cheese to form a delicious treat that any Ethiopian would agree satisfies an in-between meal hunger.
