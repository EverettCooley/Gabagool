Description : 
 I love the dipping  oil  served at my two favorite Italian restaurants. Both restaurants vary slightly in ingredients. Here is my version that brings the best of both worlds. Serve with warm bread fresh out of the oven and enjoy!
 
 
 Ingredients : 
 ½ cup  olive oil 
 ¼ cup fresh  basil , washed,dried and chopped 
 4 cloves  garlic , minced 
 ⅛ teaspoon  black pepper 
 Directions : 
 Pour  olive oil  into a shallow bowl. 
 Add  basil ,  garlic  and  pepper . 
 Stir with a spoon to evenly distribute ingredients. 
 Serve with warm bread. 
 Notes : 
 Use a good quality  olive oil  and fresh  basil  and  garlic  for best results. 
 More  garlic  can be added if desired.
