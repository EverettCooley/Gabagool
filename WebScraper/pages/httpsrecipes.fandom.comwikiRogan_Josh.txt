      Recipe by Route 79     
 Description : 
 If you have read the  Lamb  Biryani recipe - then you now know what I did with the rest of the  lamb ! This is a classic  lamb   curry  - no idea why it's called Rogan Josh - but this recipe is dead simple - and is also a very healthy low-fat dish given the use of fresh lean  leg of lamb . Here are the ingredients:
 
 Ingredients : 
       Ingredients     
 Around 600-700 grams of  leg of lamb  - chopped into bite-sized chunks. 
 The usual chunks of frozen pulped  garlic ,  ginger  in your freezer. (no chillie this time!) 
 2 teaspoons  salt 
 1 teaspoon haldi ( turmeric ) 
 3 teaspoons  garam masala 
 2 teaspoons  ground coriander 
 2 teaspoons ground  cumin 
 2 dessert spoons of plain natural  yoghurt 
 1 teaspoon of  red chillie powder 
 2 medium  onions  - finely chopped 
 Three-quarters of a tin of peeled  plum tomatoes 
 Directions : 
 This is a no-fuss method - involving just one pot and your skill and patience as a stirrer of a wooden spoon! First pour a couple of tablespoons of  vegetable oil  into the pot and heat on high until very hot. Throw in the finely chopped  onions  and stir fry until the pieces start to go soft and translucent. Then throw in the frozen chunks of  garlic  and  ginger  and keep stir-frying. (make sure you zapped the frozen chunks for 10 seconds in the microwave first so that the  ginger  and  garlic  is not frozen any more!)
 
       Fry the onions until soft     
         Add the garlic and ginger and keep frying     
 Then add all the quantities of ground spices and keep frying - the mixture should be dry-ish - and this is called "dry-frying" - or "pot-roasting". Fry for a few minutes until the heavenly aroma fills up your entire house - and then add the chunks of fresh leg of  Lamb . Keep stir-frying!
 
         Add the spices and keep frying     
         Add the lamb and keep frying     
 You should stir-fry for around 5 mins on high-ish heat until the meat has fully browned. Then throw in the tinned  tomato . I forgot to mention that you should chop all the peeled- plum tomatoes  into smallish/finer chunks first with a knife and fork. (Or else you could use pre-chopped tinned  tomatoes  if you like - but they are usually twice as expensive as the non-chopped ones!)
 
         Keep stir-frying until meat has changed colour     
         Add the chopped tin-tomato     
 Stir it all about and let it cook for a few mins before adding a couple of large dollops of plain natural  yoghurt . Stir it all in and then put the flame on high to bring it to a boil.
 
         Add the yoghurt and stir it in     
         Bring the mixture to fierce boil     
 Then put the lid on and immediately transfer to the lowest possible flame burner and then go off and do something else for half and hour. Come back after half hour - take the lid off and give it a stir - and then put lid back on and let it simmer for another half hour. Repeat this for around one and half hours - and you will notice that the consistency of the mixture is a bit thicker - and the colour is bit redder/browner.
 
         Then put lid on and transfer to low flame for slow simmer     
         After 1.5 hours on slow simmer it should be done     
 At this point it's done! Taste it in order to see if any more  salt  or chillie powder needs adding - and make sure that the  Lamb  pieces are tender - not chewy! Then sprinkle on a generous handful of freshly chopped  coriander leaf  and stir it in. Let it rest with the lid on for 5 minutes and it's ready to serve!
 
         Turn off heat and add generous handful of fresh chopped coriander leaf     
           
 This dish is best served in bowls with naan or  rice  accompaniment (or both) and a side salad of chunky  cucumber ,  tomato ,  Onion  and  carrot  with a dash of  lemon  or  vinegar . Very tasty - and very easy to make.
