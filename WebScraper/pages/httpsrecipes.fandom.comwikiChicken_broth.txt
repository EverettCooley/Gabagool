 About Chicken stock : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Chicken stock on Wikipedia 
 Chicken stock or broth is a soup made by boiling chicken bones in water, with various vegetables and flavorings. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear broth, often served with small pieces of chicken or vegetables, or with noodles or dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup has also acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and flus, and in the United States is considered a classic comfort food.
 Broth is distinguished from stock in that it technically uses chicken meat where stock uses only bones, but the terms are often used interchangeably.
 Kosher chickens make excellent broth. Many stir fry recipes in these pages require a few tablespoons of chicken broth. Since home-made chicken broth is superior to any of the canned kosher varieties, make your own and freeze it in ice cube trays. Keep the broth cubes in a plastic bag in the freezer and use them as needed.
 Stock is distinguished from broth in that it doesn't not technically use any meat, only bones, but the terms are often used interchangeably.
