Ingredients : 
 12 oz pack of  fish cake  (boned or with bones) 
 1 full cooking  onion , diced 
 a big bunch of cleaned/washed  thyme 
 5 – 10 seasoning  peppers  (pimento not hot), diced 
 1 – 2 tablespoons west Indian  hot sauce 
 2 – 3 tablespoons  oil 
 ½ – 1 cup of water 
 1 cup of  flour 
 Directions : 
 Soak the fish cake overnight in a bowl with water to remove the excess salt. 
 Wash and chip up into a bowl. 
 Add the onion thyme, peppers, and hot sauce. Mix in bowl 
 Add in some oil 
 Add in ½ – 1 cup of water 
 Add in flour (note that the water and flour amounts can vary - what you want is a nice pancake-like batter that is not runny, but not too thick) 
 Heat up a pan to medium and add lot of oil to cover entire pan with at least ½ inch of oil. 
 Then add one spoonful of mix and see if it splatters. If so it is too runny. If not and it starts to cook like pancake then you have right water/flour mixture. 
 Cook for 5 – 10 minutes depending on heat and turn once (should be golden brown and crispy). 
 Remove from pan once both sides are crispy brown and add to paper towel to drain excess oil. 
 Add hot sauce and cheese or to a fry bake and enjoy.
