Description : 
 Over a hundred years ago, the Irish in many parts of rural Ireland made bread using baking soda. This was because yeast wouldn't make dough rise unless strong flour, which was scarce in parts of Ireland, was used. So baking soda, when combined with something acidic (such as buttermilk), was effective in leavening bread.
 Another name for this bread is Tea and Wheaten Bread.
