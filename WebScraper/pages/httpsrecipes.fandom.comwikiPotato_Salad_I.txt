 Description : 
 This has got to be the best  potato salad  recipe ever made. The thing that takes this up a level is the goat cheese. Ever sense I had goat cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich I have been looking for more whys to incorporate it into more recipes. I also am a fan of the Yukon gold potato but you can use the small red rose potatoes also.
 
 Ingredients : 
 8 large  Yukon Gold potatoes 
 6 hard boiled  eggs , chopped 
 1 lb.  bacon  diced in to large pieces 
 1 large  white onion , chopped 
 2 cups of  mayonnaise 
 1 cup  sour cream 
 3 tbsp  milk 
 2 cups Shredded  cheddar  cheese 
 ½ cup of  goat cheese 
 Directions : 
 Boil potatoes until tender and then let them cool down. 
 Cook the bacon and onions till the bacon is down and the onions are golden brown. 
 Drain the bacon drippings into a small mixing bowl and mix the milk mayo and sour cream with the drippings. 
 Ok now in a large bowl add the potatoes, eggs, the onion and bacon mixture and the dressing. 
 Mix it all up till everything is coated. 
 Cover and chill for 3 hours. 
 Now if you don’t think this is the  best potato salad  recipe ever then you send me one that is better.
