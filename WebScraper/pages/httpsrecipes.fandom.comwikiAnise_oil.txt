 Wikipedia Article  About Anise oil on Wikipedia 
 By distillation the fruit yields the volatile oil of anise, which is useful in the treatment of flatulence and colic in children. It may be given as Aqua Anisi, in doses of one or more ounces, or as the Spiritus Anisi, in doses of 5â€“20 minims.
 The primary constituent of the oil (up to 90 percent) is anethole. It also contains methyl chavicol, anisic aldehyde, anisic acid, and a terpene.
