 About Salak : 
 Wikipedia Article  About Salak on Wikipedia 
 Salak (Salacca zalacca, syn. S. edulis, Calamus zalacca) is a species of palm tree (family Arecaceae) native to Indonesia and Malaysia. It is a very short-stemmed palm, with leaves up to 6 m long; each leaf has a 2 m long spiny petiole and numerous leaflets.
 The fruit grow in clusters at the base of the palm, and are also known as snakefruit due to the reddish-brown scaly skin. They are about the size and shape of a ripe fig, usually round with a distinct tip, with an edible pulp; to peel, pinch the tip of the fruit and pull away. The fruit inside consists of lobes, each lobe containing a large inedible seed. The taste is usually sweet and acidic, but its apple-like texture can vary from very dry and crumbly to moist and crunchy.
