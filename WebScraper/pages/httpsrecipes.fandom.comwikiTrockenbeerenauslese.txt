      Trockenbeerenauslese     Germany's highest classification for very sweet wines made from grapes left on the vine until nearly dry. Because these grapes, picked one by one at fullest maturity, are very concentrated in flavor and sugar, they produce extremely rich, nectarous wines. Trockenbeerenauslese wines are very rare and therefore even more expensive than Beerenauslese wines.
