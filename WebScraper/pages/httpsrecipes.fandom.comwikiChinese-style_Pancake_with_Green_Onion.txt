 Description : 
 Makes 15 pieces 
 
 Ingredients : 
 500 g  flour 
 10 g  salt 
 250 g boiling  water 
 cold  water 
 green onion 
 Directions : 
 Mix flour, salt in a pot then slowly add in boiling hot water while stirring . 
 Add cold water to make it soften/harden the dough. Mix till the dough is smooth 
 Place a wet towel or clean cloth on the dough and wait for 30 minutes (depends on the room temperature) 
 Cut 60 grams each a piece of dough and roll into a round shape. Spread sesame oil in the middle and add salt, chopped green onion. Roll up the flat round dough to a tube. Now twirl the tube into a curled up snake and flatten it again with hand only (do not push too hard). 
 Pour 2 table spoon of cooking oil and heat up the pan. 
 Place the dough in the pot and heat up both sides till itâ€™s golden brown. Fry one side at a time for about 3 minutes. Again, it all depends on how hot the pan gets. 
 Warning : 
 Everyone should be aware of the danger of splashing oil. Keep yourself within safe distance since a lid is not suggested. By frying without a lid, the pancake will be crispy.
