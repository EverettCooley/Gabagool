 Description : 
 I love zucchini bread but I hate the bulk of the recipes out there since they're too high in fat and full of a lot of unhealthful ingredients. Here's a tasty (and rather addicting) version of zucchini bread that has no fat and a surprising ingredient. I suggest making several loaves; these freeze well.
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 cups  zucchini 
 3 eggs worth of  egg substitute  (read the carton for proper measurements) 
 Â¾ cup natural  applesauce 
 1 cup  sugar  (can also use Splenda) 
 2 tsp  vanilla 
 3 cups  flour 
 1 tbsp  baking soda 
 1 tbsp  cinnamon 
 2 tsp  nutmeg 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 Directions : 
 Wash, then finely grate the zucchini. Blend with the eggs (or egg substitute), applesauce, sugar and vanilla. 
 Add the dry ingredients and mix until just blended. 
 Grease and flour an 8 x 4" loaf pan (using cooking spray) or use a nonstick loaf pan lightly sprayed with cooking spray just as a precaution. 
 Pour the mixture into the pan and bake at 350 degrees for 50 - 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the loaf comes out clean.
