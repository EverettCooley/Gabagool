Ingredients : 
 Dough : 
 1⅓ cups lukewarm  water 
 1 tsp  honey 
 3 cup  whole wheat flour 
 Filling : 
 ½ cup smooth natural  peanut butter 
 ¼ cup  honey 
 ½ cup unsweetened  applesauce 
 2 tbsp  cinnamon 
 2 tbsp  water 
 ⅔ cup  raisins 
 Directions : 
 Combine the  water , honey, and  yeast  in a large bowl. 
 Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy. 
 Add the  flour  1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. 
 When the dough becomes to stiff to mix, turn it out onto a floured board and knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. 
 Put it in a very lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to rise for 1 hour. 
 Beat in all the remaining ingredients except the  raisins . 
 Remove the risen dough from the bowl and knead about ten times on a clean board. 
 Roll out into a large rectangle about 15" x 14". 
 Spread with filling to ½" of the edge. 
 Sprinkle  raisins  evenly over the filling. 
 Roll the rectangle into a log, starting at the 15-in side, pinch the edges to seal, and slice into 1" thick rounds. 
 Place on a nonstick baking sheet, cover, and allow to rise for about 20 minutes, or until light. 
 Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.
