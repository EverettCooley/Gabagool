These peanut butter balls are a holiday favorite in our house.  I modified my mother's recipe to use natural peanut butter.  
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 jar unsalted crunchy natural  peanut butter 
 1/2 - 3/4 jar salted crunchy natural peanut butter 
 1 stick of  butter , softened 
 1-1/3 C.  powdered sugar 
 7+ C. of  puffed rice  cereal ("Rice Krispies") 
 1-2 packages of  chocolate  bits 
 Directions : 
 Using a mixer, blend peanut butter and butter with sugar. 
 Add the rice cereal and mix well. The dough should be very stiff, and it may be necessary to hand mix the last cup. 
 Chill dough thoroughly. 
 Roll the dough into 1-inch balls, and place on wax paper.  Freeze until solid. 
 Melt chocolate in a double boiler. 
 Dip each ball into the chocolate to cover. 
 Return to the wax paper and chill or freeze until chocolate has set. 
 Store balls in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. 
 Notes : 
 makes 6-7 dozen 
 Add additional peanut butter, sugar, or rice krispies as needed to provide desired taste/texture 
 The dough will be fairly sticky even after it is chilled.  Food preparation gloves are helpful for rolling it into balls. 
 Freezing the balls in a metal brownie tin, and then placing the tin on a flat ice pack to stay cold while dipping them in the chocolate makes that step much easier.
