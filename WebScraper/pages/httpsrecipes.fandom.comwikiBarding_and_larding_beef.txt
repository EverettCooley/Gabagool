Larding beef means to artificially marble the meat with fat. The fat is introduced in the beefâ€™s cut using a larding needle. The fat injected can be beef fat or more likely pork fat.
 Barding beef engages wrapping the meat in two or more strips of fat which have the purpose of protecting the meat from drying. There are people who confuse larding beef with barding beef but the difference is very clear.
 Both larding and barding have the purpose of protecting the meat from drying and the meat become more delicate and moist. Barding beef is considered to be more efficient than larding because the sheets of fat can be removed of the meat after it has been cooked and the sheets also protect the meat from browning. The process of barding or larding are used mostly when the meat is subjected to roasting. The purpose of injecting strips of fat with the larding needle is to give the meat an extra flavor; it is usually used pork fat or bacon. Larding requires a little more time than barding because the beef cut has to be injected several times in numerous parts not only in one place otherwise the meat would be moisture in a specific place and dry in other places.
