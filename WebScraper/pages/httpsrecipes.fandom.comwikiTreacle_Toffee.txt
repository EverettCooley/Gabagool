 Description : 
 Bonfire toffee is the absolute treat on Bonfire night in the UK. The Treacle Toffee Recipe for Bonfire Toffee is simple, quick and easy to make but must be approached with caution; toffee gets very, very hot (up to 140°C / 270°F) as it is boils. Treacle Toffee keeps very well stored in an airtight tin so make enough for Bonfire night and extra toffee for Christmas.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb / 450 g  dark brown sugar 
 ¼ pint / 120 ml water 
 ¼ level tsp  cream of tartar 
 ½ cup / 115 g  black treacle  /  molasses 
 ½ cup / 115 g  golden syrup  /  corn syrup 
 Directions : 
 Butter a 12" x 4" / 30 cm x 10cm or 7" / 18 cm square tin. 
 In a heavy based 4-pint sauce pan dissolve the sugar and water over a low heat. 
 Add all the remaining ingredients and bring to the boil. 
 Using a sugar or toffee thermometer boil to 270°F / 140°C (soft crack). 
 If you do not have a sugar or toffee thermometer - when you drop a bit of the syrup into cold water, it will solidify into threads that, when removed from the water, are flexible, not brittle. 
 The toffee strands will bend slightly before breaking. 
 Once this stage is reached (about 10 minutes maximum) pour the toffee into the prepared tin and leave to cool. 
 Once the toffee is cold remove it from the tin and break with a toffee hammer or solid sharp object, and the toffee will crack into pieces. 
 Store in an airtight tin if you can resist it long enough!. 
 NOTE : 
 For a soft chewy toffee similar to the Spanish  Arropia  boil to 250°F / 120°C (Hard Ball)
