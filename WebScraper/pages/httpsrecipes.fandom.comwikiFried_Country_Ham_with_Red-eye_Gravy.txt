Ingredients : 
 1 lbs country  ham , sliced . brewed 
 Â¾ cup strong  coffee , freshly 
 
 Directions : 
 Cut off a strip of fat from the outside rim of the  ham , leaving a portion of the fat intact. 
 Cut the strip of fat into small cubes. 
 Using a sharp knife, cut the fat remaining on the  ham  at intervals down to the meat. 
 Put the cubed fat into a skillet, preferably of black cast iron, and cook, stirring, until the fat is rendered. 
 Scoop out and discard the rendered pieces of fat. 
 Add the  ham  slice to the skillet and fry until nicely browned on one side. 
 Turn the slice and continue frying until brown and cooked through. 
 I remove the  ham  slice. 
 Pour the  coffee  into the skillet and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. 
 Cut the  ham  slice into 2 to 4 pieces and serve the gravy on the side, to be poured over  grits  and/or spooned over the  ham  pieces.
