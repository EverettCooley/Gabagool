BASIC INDIAN WHITE SAUCE
 3 cups  milk 
1/2 cup  plain flour 
1 tablespoon  butter 
2 tablespoons  Cheese  grated
In a dry heavy sauce pan, dry roast the  flour  till light pinkish in color. 
Remove and keep
aside to cool. Melt  butter  in the pan, add half the  milk . Mix the remaining 
 milk  in the
cooled  flour  to form a smooth paste. When  milk  comes to a boil, add paste 
and stir
continuously. Bring back to a boil. Cook till the sauce is thick enough to 
coat the back of
a spoon thickly. Sprinkle  salt  and fresh ground  pepper  and stir to mix well.
