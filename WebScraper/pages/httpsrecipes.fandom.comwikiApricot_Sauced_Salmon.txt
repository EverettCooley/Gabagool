APRICOT SAUCED SALMON
 4 fresh or frozen salmon steaks, 3/4 inch thick (about 1-1/4 pounds total)
Nonstick spray coating
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash ground red pepper
1 5-1/2-ounce can apricot nectar
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 cups watercress leaves or shredded spinach or romaine
1/2 of a medium cucumber, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 green onions, sliced (1/4 cup)
 Thaw the salmon, if frozen. Rinse salmon; pat dry. Spray the unheated rack of a broiler pan with nonstick coating. Place salmon on rack. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 8 to 12 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. (Or, spray a grill basket with nonstick coating. Place salmon in basket. Grill salmon on the grill rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 8 to 12 minutes or until salmon flakes easily with a fork, turning once.)
 Meanwhile, for sauce, in a small saucepan combine the cornstarch, salt, and ground red pepper. Gradually stir in the nectar; add honey and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Cover; keep warm.
 In a large bowl toss together the watercress, spinach, or romaine; cucumber; and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Divide among 4 serving plates. To serve, place salmon on watercress mixture and spoon sauce over each serving. Sprinkle with green onions. 
MAKES 4 servings.
