Ingredients : 
 1 package  egg roll wrappers  (4½ inches by 5½ inches - each wrapper makes 2 bow ties) 
 Syrup : 
 1 cup  brown sugar 
 ½ cup  corn syrup 
 ½ cup  honey 
 ½ cup  water 
 4 – 6 cups  oil  for deep-frying, as needed 
 Directions : 
 Lay out a wrapper so that the longer (5½ inch) sides are on the top and bottom, and the shorter (4½ inch) sides on the left and right. 
 Cut each  egg  roll wrapper from top to bottom into 4 equal pieces. 
 Using a paring knife, cut a ½ inch slit in the center of each piece. 
 Using 2 pieces, one laid on top of the other, make a knot like a bow tie (fold one end of the piece on top and thread it through the slit. Turn over, fold, and thread through the other way. Open the folded ends before deep-frying). 
 Heat wok and add  oil . 
 Deep-fry the bow ties until golden brown, about 5 at a time. 
 Drain on paper towels or a tempura rack if you have one. 
 Boil the syrup ingredients in a pot on medium heat for about 5 minutes. 
 Dip the bow ties into the boiling syrup (if the syrup isn't boiling the bow ties will be too sweet), and drain well. 
 Set aside to harden. 
 Serve cold. 
 The bow ties can be stored in an air-tight container.
