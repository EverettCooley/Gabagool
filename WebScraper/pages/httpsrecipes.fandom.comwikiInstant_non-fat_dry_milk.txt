 About instant non-fat dry milk : 
 Instant non-fat dry milk  is made by removing  water  from pasteurized skim  milk . It contains no added  preservatives .
 
 Storage : 
 Unopened Milk : 
 Store non-fat dry milk off the floor in a cool, dry place.
 
 Opened Milk : 
 Store opened, non-fat, dry milk in a tightly covered container. When exposed to the air and moisture, then it becomes lumpy and the flavor changes.
 Because the milk has been treated with a steam process to create large, porous, free-flowing particles, it mixes readily in water. After mixing with water, cover milk and refrigerate. Handle and treat the same as fresh fluid milk. Use within 3 to 5 days.
 
 Uses&Tips :
