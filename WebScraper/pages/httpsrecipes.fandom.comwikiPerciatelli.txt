 Long strands of pasta, resembling fat spaghetti, which have a hole running lengthwise through the middle. They are used in the same manner as spaghetti. If not available substitute fettuccine, linguine or spaghetti. 
 Bucatini is a thick spaghetti-like pasta with a hole running through the middle. The name comes from búco, meaning "hole" in Italian. It tastes similar to spaghetti, but is thicker, with almost a vermacèlli texture. Originating in Sicily, Bucatini is good with semi-thick sauces, or just buttered with spices. Small diameter (about 2.4 - 2.7 mm) and smooth surface long-cut dry hollow pasta.
