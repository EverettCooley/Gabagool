 Albanian desserts originate from either Turkey or Greece and are popular all over the Balkans. These dishes are inspired from both Western and Eastern civilizations. The desserts that are entirely Albanian consist of local fruits, which are used both for compotes and for various types of cakes or pies. Albanian Walnut Cake with Lemon Glaze is a good example in this case. Citrus fruits, such as oranges and lemons are used in many of the Albanian desserts. Also, the Albanian cuisine features many recipes of puddings, the most important of them being oshaf, which is based on sheep milk and figs. Some of the most appreciated desserts in Albania are: 
 
 Baklava 
 Kadaif 
 Llokume 
 Mualebi 
 Revani 
 Halva 
 Hasude 
 Sultjazh
