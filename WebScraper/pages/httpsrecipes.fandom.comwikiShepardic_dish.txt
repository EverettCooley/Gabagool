 Description : 
 This is a Jewish Sephardic dish which is quite similar to the Turkish "burak." (You can also consider it the Sephardic equivalent of the Ashkenazic knish.) Burekas can be prepared with various types of dough:  strudel dough  (thin leaves; most traditional), rising dough, or with types of prepared dough found in the market. Typical fillings include  potato , soft  white cheese ,  spinach  (sometimes  spinach  and  Potato ), and  mushrooms . This is a dish served on festive occasions, but also widely sold on Israeli street corners. 
 To be tasty, it must be served hot and fresh.
