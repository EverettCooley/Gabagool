 Ingredients 
 Grenadine  syrup 
 Crème de menthe 
 151 proof  rum 
 Directions 
 Divide a tall shot glass into thirds. 
 Fill the lowest third with grenadine syrup, the middle third with creme de menthe, and float the 151 in the top third. 
 Wet a thin straw, light the 151 by passing a lighter over it. 
 Plunge the straw to the bottom of the glass into the grenadine syrup and suck. 
 If done rapidly and correctly the straw will not melt, and you can observe flames traveling up the inside of it. 
 Stop sucking when the flame is inside the straw. 
 Serve in a shot glass.
