INGREDIENTS : 
 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 1/2 cup good-quality popping corn 
 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and kept warm 
 2 tablespoons tomato powder (see headnote) 
 Salt 
 
 DIRECTIONS : 
 Heat a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil and popping corn; cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cook, shaking the saucepan regularly, until all the kernels have popped. Transfer the popcorn to a large bowl. Pour the warm, melted butter (to taste) evenly over it and toss gently to coat, then sprinkle with the tomato powder and season lightly with salt.
 Serve right away.
 NOTE: To make tomato powder using a dehydrator, cut Romas or garden tomatoes into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange them on the racks of a dehydrator; dehydrate for 4 to 12 hours, depending on their moisture content. Check every 2 hours for doneness; the slices should be thoroughly dried and will snap when you try to bend them.
 Working in batches, crumble the pieces into a dedicated (clean) spice grinder; pulverize to a powder. Transfer to an airtight container; the tomato powder can be kept in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months.
