 2 tbsp  lemon juice 
 1 cup  matzo meal 
 ½ cup  margarine   or   butter

 Directions : 
 In a shallow 2 quart baking dish, mix 1 ¼ cups  sugar  and tapioca. 
 Add  rhubarb ,  raspberries , and  lemon juice ; mix gently but thoroughly. 
 Let stand 15 minutes to 1 hour to soften tapioca; mix several times. 
 Meanwhile, in a food processor or a bowl, whirl or rub together with your fingers the matzo meal, the remaining ½ cup  sugar ,  margarine , and  nutmeg  until fine crumbs form. 
 Squeeze to compact into lumps, then crumble over  rhubarb  mixture. 
 Bake in a 375 °F. 
 Oven until cobbler is bubbling in center and top is golden brown, about 1 hour. 
 Let cool 15 minutes; spoon cobbler into bowls and top with sorbet, if desired.
