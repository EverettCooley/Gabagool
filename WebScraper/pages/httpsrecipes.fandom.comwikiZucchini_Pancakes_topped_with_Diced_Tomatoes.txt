 Makes 4 servings. 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  tomatoes , peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped 
 1½ lbs  zucchini  or  summer squash 
 1 medium  red onion 
 1½ tsp  salt 
 2 cloves  garlic , crushed 
 2 tbsp fresh  mint  or  basil , chopped 
 ⅛ tsp ground  nutmeg 
 2 tbsp grated  Parmesan cheese 
 ½ cup  egg substitute 
 3 tbsp  flour 
 black pepper , to taste 
 2 tbsp  canola oil , for frying 
 Directions : 
 Place the tomatoes in a colander over the sink and strain the juices. 
 Set aside. 
 Grate the zucchini and onion. 
 Roll up in a hand towel and squeeze out the excess moisture. This step is important — otherwise the pancakes won't be the right consistency. 
 In a big bowl, combine the zucchini and onion with garlic, salt, fresh mint or basil, nutmeg, cheese, eggs, flour, salt and pepper. 
 Mix to combine. 
 In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat oil on high heat. 
 Drop ¼ cup of the zucchini batter in the hot oil. Flatten if needed. 
 Let the pancake completely brown on one side before flipping to brown the other. 
 Remove and place on paper towels to blot dry. 
 Remove tomatoes from the colander. 
 Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
 Serve the zucchini pancakes topped with tomatoes.
