There are six main categories of tea â€“ four of the oldest categorized by color (black, white, red and green teas) as well as herbal tea and oolong tea. The subtle variations among the same tea category increased their numbers through time, but most of the famous tea types are a few thousand years old. Modern tea making also resorts to biological engineering of tea plants, in order to obtain better flavors, while traditional tea making resorted to selecting only the best tea bushes and improving them in time, through natural methods. Masala Chai is a typical Indian variety. Aromatic masalas are added to loose tea to make spiced Chai, and this has been the Indian drink of choice for hundreds of years. It is a perfect blend of freshly ground spices (masala) like cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom and pepper, added to a boiling pot of loose leaf tea and milk to make a delicious, satisfying and healthy beverage.
