 Serves : 1 
 Ingredients 
 
 2 oz. (60 ml)  white rum , Cuban if available 
 1  lime  (or 2 ounces (60 ml) lime juice) 
 1 tsp  powdered sugar 
 4  mint  leaves 
 club soda 
 Garnish 
 mint sprig 
 Directions 
 Muddle mint leaves and sugar. 
 Fill with ice, then add rum and lime juice. 
 Stir, then add a splash of club soda. 
 Garnish with mint sprig. 
 Variations 
 Ernest Hemingway requested Mojitos without sugar. Of course, this suggests that less lime juice be used. 
 Sometimes, the juiced lime is used as an additional garnish. 
 For a twist on the traditional mojito, add a handful of raspberries during the muddling stage for an extra hit of flavour.
