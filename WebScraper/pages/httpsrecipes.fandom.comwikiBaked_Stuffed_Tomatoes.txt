 Ingredients : 
 10–oz. pkg. frozen chopped  spinach , thawed and squeezed to remove as much moisture as possible 
 1 cup small curd low–fat (2%)  cottage cheese  (8 oz.) 
 1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions (white and light green parts) 
 1/4 cup soft blue  Cheese , crumbled (1 oz.) 
 14–oz. can  white kidney beans , rinsed and drained 
 2 large  tomatoes 
 8 cups mixed salad greens 
 8 thin slices  Italian bread , toasted, for serving 
 Directions : 
 1. Preheat oven to 400 °F. Bring large pot of  water  to a boil.
 2. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix  spinach ,  cottage cheese , scallions, blue  Cheese  and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground  pepper  until well blended. Gently stir in beans. Set aside.
 3. With small, sharp knife, score an “x” in base of each  tomato . Carefully drop  tomatoes  into boiling  water  and cook 20 seconds. Remove from  water  with slotted spoon. When cool enough to handle, peel  tomatoes  with small sharp knife and cut out cores. Cut each  tomato  in half through equator. With spoon, scoop out and discard seeds, then remove and discard about half of the flesh from each  tomato  half.
 4. Stuff  tomato  halves with  spinach – Cheese  mixture, then place in shallow casserole just large enough to hold  tomatoes . Bake until soft and beginning to exude juices, about 20 minutes.
 5. Meanwhile, arrange salad greens in ring on each plate. Carefully transfer one  tomato  half to center of each ring. Serve with toasted  bread  slices.
