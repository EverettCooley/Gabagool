 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2	cup	 water 
 1Â lb	oriental  aubergines  (  eggplant  )- (abt 2) 
 1	tsp	 salt 
 1	x	semi-hot  green chile  seeded, and cut 3"-long julienne strips 
 2	x	 garlic  cloves crushed 
 2	x	 scallions  cut 3"-long strips, the white part quartered 
 2	tsp	hot red  chile flakes 
 3	tbl	 julienne  stips of  onion , Chinese  chive , or Korean  radish 
 1	piece	fresh  ginger  - (1" long) crushed 
 Directions : 
 Bring the  water ,  aubergines  and  salt  to a boil in a saucepan large enough to contain all the ingredients. 
 Cook over moderate heat for 3 minutes, turning the  aubergine  in the  water  now and then. 
 The  aubergine  should be half-cooked and pliant but not mushy. 
 Remove and set aside, cool, and cut into 3 equal pieces. 
 Cut a deep cross in one end of each piece so that they can be opened and stuffed. Set aside. 
 Thoroughly mix the  green chile ,  garlic ,  ginger , scallions,  chile flakes  and  Onion  or  chive  or  radish  together. 
 Open up the cut in each  aubergine  and push in about 2 tablespoons of the stuffing. 
 Place the stuffed  aubergine  in a glass or plastic container that has a tight cover. 
 Cover the container and put it in a cool but not refrigerated spot for 1 day to mature. 
 Then serve and refrigerate. 
 The kimchi is best eaten during the first 3 days if you prefer a light flavor but for more bite, wait until later in the week when the mixture will have fermented. 
 It can be refrigerated for a maximum of 1 week.
