 About Cod : 
 Cod belongs to the order Gadiformes and to the class Actinopterygii, having up to 130 cm in size and living up to 25 years in areas characterised by temperate climates. As for the distribution, it can be found in Barents Sea, Spitsbergen to Bay of Biscay around Iceland, as well as in southwest Greenland and North Carolina. This fish has a lateral line smooth along its length, while the body colour is brownish-green dorsally, becoming slightly paler ventrally. More than this aspect, it should be known that this fish is an active one and it occurs inshore and offshore waters. In fact it usually enters coastal waters in spring and returns to deeper waters in winter. As for smaller fish in inshore waters, they feed on small crustaceans like copepods, amphipods and euphausiids, and small fish, unlike larger fish prefer fishes. Cod can be eaten fresh, boiled, dried, canned, frozen, smoked, steamed, fried, broiled, microwaved or baked.
