Ingredients : 
 1  fish  weighing about 2 lbs 
 1½ cups  taheeni  
 1½ cups chopped  onion 
 1 cup  olive oil 
 ¾ cup  lemon juice 
 1¼ tsp  salt 
 water 
 Directions : 
 Clean and  salt  fish. 
 Refrigerate for several hours. 
 Allow it to return to room temperature, sprinkle with  olive oil  and bake in moderate oven until flesh seems to flake apart easily under a fork. 
 Meanwhile fry  onions  in  olive oil  until yellow. 
 Beat  lemon juice  and  water  slowly into the taheeni, adding more  lemon juice  to taste if necessary. 
 The taheeni sauce will become very creamy. 
 Mix  onions  into sauce, pour over the baked fish and return it to the oven. 
 Bake about 20 minutes in moderate oven. 
 Some of the sauce will be absorbed into the fish and the  onions  will be very well cooked. 
 Serve this dish cold.
