 The Dutch like their baking. 
 Although renowned for the fact that typically one biscuit is offered with tea or coffee, and then the tin is quickly closed and put away again, this is not usually the case anymore. 
 Different types of biscuits and cakes will be offered on a plate and remain on the table. 
 Below are some recipes for Dutch staples in baking, including the aptly named "Lange Vingers" (Long Fingers) and "Bokkepootjes" (Goat's Feet).
