 Makes 48  shrimp  toasts 
 Ingredients : 
 4  shallots 
 4  garlic  cloves 
 1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh  gingerroot 
 2 teaspoons dry  sherry 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon  sugar 
 1 tablespoon  cornstarch 
 1 tablespoon beaten  egg white 
 1 tablespoon finely chopped  fresh coriander  plus small leaves for garnish 
 1 tablespoon light  soy sauce 
 1 pound  shrimp  (about 24), shelled, de-veined if desired 
 12 slices of homemade-type  white bread , crusts discarded 
 1 cup fine fresh  breadcrumbs 
 vegetable oil  for deep-frying 
 ¼ cup  pickled ginger  (available at Asian markets and some specialty foods shops), drained and cut into julienne strips, for garnish 
 Directions : 
 In a food processor blend the  shallots , the  garlic , the  gingerroot , the  sherry , the  salt , the  sugar , the  cornstarch , the  egg  white, the chopped coriander, and the  soy sauce 
 Add the  shrimp , pulsing the motor, and purée the mixture until it is paste-like but not completely smooth. 
 Spread 1 heaping tablespoon of the  shrimp  mixture on each slice of  bread , rounding off the top 
 Dip the coated side of each slice in the  bread  crumbs, shaking off the excess, and cut each slice into 4 triangles. (The  shrimp  toasts may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered tightly with plastic wrap and chilled.) 
 In a large heavy skillet heat 1½ inches of the  oil  to 360°F and in it fry the  shrimp  toasts, coated sides down first, in batches, for 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden. 
 Let the  shrimp  toasts drain well on paper towels, garnish each  shrimp  toast with some of the pickled  ginger  and 1 of the  coriander leaves , and serve the  shrimp  toasts immediately.
