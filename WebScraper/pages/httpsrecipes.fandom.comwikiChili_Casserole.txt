Description : 
 Since so many people seem to be confirmed sad and/or meat eaters, I often add one box / package prepared heartline meatless meats to the  chili  before layering. It has fooled everyone to date with no complaints :).
 
 Ingredients : 
 2 x 16oz cans  S&W Chili Makin's  (or any other pre-made, fat-free vegetarian chili) 
 9 oz fat-free, grated  cheese 
 6 oz bag fat-free, baked  corn chips 
 Directions : 
 Simply layer the  chili , then chips, then  cheese  (usually good for two layers :). heat in oven at 350°F or 375°F until  cheese  is melted and  chili  is warm. 
 Serve with additional  corn  chips if desired.
