Ingredients : 
 3  chicken breasts 
 ¼  onion  (diced) 
 ½ tsp  chili powder 
 ½ tsp  cumin 
 ½ tsp  garlic powder 
 12 oz grated  colby  or  jack cheese 
 vegetable oil 
 8 corn  tortillas 
 Green Sauce : 
 10  tomatillos  (quartered) 
 ½  onion  (diced) 
 ½ cup mild  green chiles  or 4.5 oz can 
 3 tbsp  vegetable oil 
 ½ tsp  salt 
 ½ tsp  paprika 
 1 tsp  garlic powder 
 ¼ tsp  cayenne pepper 
 ½ cup  water 
 Directions : 
 Boil  chicken  breasts until done and cube. 
 In a large oiled pan, sauté  chicken , spices, and  onions  until the  onions  are clear. 
 Allow the  chicken  to cool and add  cheese . 
 In an oiled skillet, cook tortillas on each side until soft (approximately 10 seconds each side on medium high heat). 
 Set the tortillas aside, stacking to prevent drying, until cool enough to touch. 
 Place the  chicken  mixture in the center of each tortilla and roll. 
 Place enchiladas in a 9 inch square dish and cover with green sauce. 
 In a sauce pan, sauté  onion  and  garlic  until  onions  are clear. 
 Add tomatillos, green chilies,  paprika ,  water  and bring to a boil. 
 Add remaining ingredients, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. 
 Allow to cool for a few minutes and pour into a blender. 
 Blend the mixture until your desired texture is achieved. 
 Please note; a finer mixture covers the enchiladas better and brings out more flavor. 
 If you desire a hotter, more spicy sauce, add hot jalepeños when adding the tomatillos and green chilies.
