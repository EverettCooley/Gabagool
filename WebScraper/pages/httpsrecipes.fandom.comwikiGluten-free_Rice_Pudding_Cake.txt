 Ingredients : 
 3 cups cooked  rice 
 4  eggs , beaten 
 ½ cup  demerara sugar   [1]  (or  brown sugar ) 
 2 medium  bananas , mashed 
 2  apples , finely chopped 
 1 pound  cottage cheese 
 2 cups mixed  dried fruit 
 ½ cup  dried apricots , chopped 
 ½ cup mixed  nuts  or  almonds , roughly chopped 
 grated rind of one  mandarin  or  orange 
 1 teaspoon  nutmeg 
 1 teaspoon  cinnamon 
 Directions : 
 Combine everything together and mix well. 
 Place mixture in a greased tin, such as a fluted (or regular) bundt pan. 
 Bake at 400°F for about half an hour until firm and cooked through. 
 When a skewer comes out clean, the cake is cooked. 
 Allow to cool in the tin. 
 The  rice  should be well drained after cooking in  water , and left in the refrigerator for at least a few hours before baking the cake. 
 Notes : 
 
 ↑   Demerara sugar  is raw  brown sugar , originally from Demerara in Guyana.
Although Australia grows endless acres of  sugar cane ,  demerara sugar  is considered so good that Australia imports it. Some people like it in their  coffee . Demerara adds a sort of toffee-ish taste to the cake. If you don't have demerara, don't worry - the cake will still be delicious with  brown sugar .
