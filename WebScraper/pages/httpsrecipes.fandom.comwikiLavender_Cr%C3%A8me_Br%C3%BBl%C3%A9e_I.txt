Ingredients : 
 ½  vanilla bean , split in half lengthwise 
 1¼ cups  low-fat milk 
 1¼ cups fat-free  milk 
 1½ tsp dried  lavender  flowers 
 3 large  eggs 
 4 large  egg  whites 
 ⅓ cup raw cane  sugar  plus 6 teaspoons for topping 
 Directions : 
 Scrape the seeds from the  vanilla bean  pod. In a medium saucepan, combine the  vanilla bean  pod and seeds, the  milks , and the  lavender  flowers. Bring to a simmer over low heat. Remove from the heat, cover, and steep for 30 minutes. 
 Preheat the oven to 325 °F. Return the pan to medium heat and bring the  milk  mixture back to a low boil. 
 Combine the  eggs ,  egg  whites, and  Sugar  in a bowl. Slowly whisk the hot  milk  into the  egg  mixture, stirring constantly ntil all the  milk  has been added. 
 Strain the custard through a fine mesh strainer or a colander lined with cheesecloth. 
 Pour ½ cup of custard into each of 12 ramekins and place them in a baking pan. Add enough hot  water  to the baking pan to bring the  water  halfway up the sides of the ramekins. 
 Bake for 50 minutes or until the custard is set. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled (1 to 2 hours). 
 When ready to serve, preheat the broiler. P{lace the ramekins of chilled custard on a baking sheet. Sprinkle ½ teaspoon raw cane  Sugar  in each ramekin and broil quickly until the  Sugar  is caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes. 
 Watch carefully to avoid burning. Let cool at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
