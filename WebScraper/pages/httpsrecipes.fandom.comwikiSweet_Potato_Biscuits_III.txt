 Original recipe 
 Makes 18 biscuits 
 Ingredients : 
 butter-flavored  cooking spray  or baking parchment paper 
 2½ cups (312.5 g) sifted unbleached  all-purpose flour 
 2 tablespoons (24 g) spoonable brown  sugar substitute 
 2 teaspoons (10 ml)  baking powder 
 1 teaspoon (5 ml)  baking soda 
 ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) ground  nutmeg 
 ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml)  salt 
 ½ teaspoon (4 g)  granulated sugar 
 ¼ cup (59 ml)  canola oil 
 ¾ cup (177 ml) + 2 tablespoons (30 ml) cultured non-fat  buttermilk 
 ¾ cup (180 g) mashed cooked  sweet potato 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). 
 Lightly spray a nonstick baking sheet with cooking spray or line with parchment paper. 
 In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, salt, and sugar. 
 In a large measuring cup, combine oil, buttermilk, and mashed sweet potato. 
 Add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined (the dough will be quite dry). 
 Transfer dough to a floured work surface. 
 Knead a few times and pat to 1 inch (2.5 cm) thickness rectangle about 8 inches x 5 inches (20 cm x 12.5 cm). 
 Dip a sharp knife in flour, then cut the dough into thirds lengthwise. 
 Then cut each long strip into 6 equal pieces, making 18 squares in all. 
 Transfer biscuits to prepared baking sheet. 
 Bake about 12 to 13 minutes, until tops are golden and firm to the touch. 
 Serve warm.
