Ingredients : 
 1 cup of  tapioca  (sako) 
 1⅓ cups of  powdered milk 
 ¾ – 1 cup of  sugar 
 1 teaspoon of ground  cardamom 
 ½ teaspoon of  saffron  powder 
 3  eggs , beaten 
 2 teaspoons of  vanilla 
 1½ tablespoons of  butter 
 Directions : 
 On low heat, cook the tapioca in 4 – 6 cups of  water . 
 Start with 4 cups of  water  and add more  water  if needed. 
 The cooked tapioca should be thick and bubbly, but not too thick. 
 Some tapiocas will cook more quickly than others. 
 At minimum, it should take at least 20 minutes. 
 In a bowl on the side, mix the  powdered milk  with 1 cup of  water . 
 Add to the tapioca on the stove. 
 Also add the  cardamom ,  saffron  and  sugar  (I prefer the pudding to be sweet, so I use 1 full cup of  sugar . If you prefer a pudding that is less sweet us only ¾ cup) 
 Heat. 
 Put the  eggs  in a bowl. 
 Gradually add to it 1 cup of the hot tapioca mixture. 
 Return all of the  egg  mixture to the cooking pot. 
 Cook until nearly bubbly, but do not boil. 
 Cook and stir for 2 more minutes. 
 Remove from the heat. 
 Stir in the  butter  and  vanilla . 
 Pour the tapioca pudding into a bowl. 
 Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a film from forming (the plastic wrap should actually touch the surface of the pudding). 
 Put in the refrigerator until well chilled. 
 Serve. Delicious!
