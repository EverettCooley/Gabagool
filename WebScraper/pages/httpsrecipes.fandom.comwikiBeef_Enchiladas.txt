 Ingredients : 
 The Sauce
 
 1/4 Cup  shortening 
 1 Tbsp  cumin 
 1 Tbsp  chili powder 
 1 8oz Can  tomato  Sauce 
 2 Tbsp  flour 
 1 Tbsp  garlic salt 
 4 Cups  water 
 
The Enchiladas
 
 
 12  corn  Tortillas 
 vegetable oil 
 1 Lb Ground  Beef 
 1/2 Large  Onion  (diced) 
 garlic salt 
 1 Cup Grated  Colby   Cheese 
 Directions : 
 In large sauce pan, heat the  shortening  on medium high until a near boiling state. Stir in  cumin ,  chili powder ,  flour  and slowly add 2 cups of  water  while stirring constantly, as if making a  cream  gravy. Note: when the  cumin ,  chili powder , and  flour  are added to the  shortening , the mixture will begin to thicken quickly, so have the 2 cups of  water  ready to pour! Stir in the  garlic salt  and slowly add the  water  and  tomato  sauce. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes covered.
 
In an oiled skillet, cook tortillas on each side until soft (approximately 10 seconds each side on medium high heat). Set the tortillas aside, stacking to prevent drying, until cool enough to touch. Note: the tortillas can be soaked in the sauce for added flavor, but I would note soak for more than 5 minutes, they may become too soft to roll. Brown the ground  Beef , drain grease, add  Onion  and continue to cook until  onions  are clear. Add  garlic salt  to taste. Allow to cool and add  Cheese  to the mixture. Add small amount of ground  Beef  to center of tortilla and roll. Place in a well oiled 9" x 13" pan. After rolling all tortillas, pour sauce over enchiladas and bake at 375ยบ for 20 minutes.
