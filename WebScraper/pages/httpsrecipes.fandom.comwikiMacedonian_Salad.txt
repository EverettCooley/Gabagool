 Ingredients : 
 1 large  eggplant  (about 9 inches long) 
 a little  oil  for the baking tray 
 4 tablespoons  olive oil 
 2 tablespoons  red wine vinegar 
 1 medium clove  garlic , minced 
 ½ teaspoon  salt  (more, to taste) 
 freshly ground  black pepper 
 ½ teaspoon  basil 
 ¼ teaspoon  thyme 
 ¼ teaspoon  marjoram  or  oregano 
 1 tablespoon fresh  lemon juice 
 ¼ cup (packed) finely minced  parsley 
 2 small  scallions , very finely minced 
 ½ medium  red bell pepper , minced 
 ½ medium  green bell pepper , minced 
 1 medium  tomato , diced 
 Optional Garnishes : 
 olives  (Greek, oil-cured, or Niçoise) 
 yogurt 
 crumbled  feta  cheese 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 375 °F. 
 Spread the  eggplant  cubes onto a lightly oiled baking tray, and roast in the oven about 15 minutes, or until tender enough so a fork can slide in easily. 
 Remove from oven. 
 Meanwhile, combine the  olive oil ,  vinegar ,  garlic ,  salt ,  pepper , herbs, and  lemon juice  in a medium-sized bowl. 
 Add the still-warm  eggplant  and stir. 
 Cover, and let sit for at least 2 hours (at this stage, it will keep in the refrigerator for several days). 
 Add the remaining vegetables within an hour or two of serving. 
 Serve garnished with  olives  and  yogurt  or crumbled  feta  cheese.
