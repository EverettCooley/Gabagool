      Jamaican jerk spice     
 About jerk spice : 
 Jamaican jerk spice is a (usually) dry seasoning blend that originated on the Caribbean island after which it's named, and which is used primarily in the preparation of grilled meat. The ingredients can vary, depending on the cook, but Jamaican jerk blend is generally a combination of  chilies ,  thyme , spices (such as  cinnamon ,  ginger ,  allspice  and  cloves ),  garlic  and  onions . Jerk seasoning can be either rubbed directly onto meat, or blended with a liquid to create a Marinade. In the Caribbean, the most common meats seasoned in this fashion are  pork  and  chicken . Such preparations are referred to as jerk pork and jerk chicken.
