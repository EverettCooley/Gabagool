Ingredients : 
 5 lbs mixed dried fruits ( raisins , currants ,  prunes ,  cherries ) 
 ¼ lb chopped  nuts 
 ½ lb mixed citrus peel 
 1½ to 2 lbs  brown sugar 
 2 tbsp  mixed spice  ( cinnamon ,  clove ,  nutmeg  etc.) 
 10  eggs 
 1 cup  rum 
 12 ozs  flour 
 1 tsp  baking powder 
 1 lb  margarine 
 1 tsp  salt 
 1 cup  port wine 
 1 tbsp  vanilla extract 
 1 tbsp  almond extract 
 1 cup  water 
 ¼ lb  pineapple  jam 
 browning 
 Directions : 
 Mince the fruit and soak in 1 cup of  rum  with spices, essences,  nuts , jam and ¼ lb  sugar . 
 Mix ingredients well and put in a jar, cover and allow mixture to steep for 3 weeks or more. 
 When ready to bake, cook fruit over a low heat with 1 cup of  water  for 15 minutes (this preliminary cooking of the fruit shortens baking time of cake and reduces the possibility of the cake burning). 
 Cream the  butter / margarine  and remaining  sugar  well and add  eggs  beating in one at a time. 
 Then add this to the fruit mixture. 
 Stir in enough  browning  to make the mixture dark brown in color. 
 Add the  flour  and  baking powder  last. 
 Place mixture into baking pans -greased and lined with 2 sheets of waxed paper. 
 Fill the pans ¾ full. 
 Bake in a 300 °F oven for 2½ to 3 hours. 
 Test with skewer before removing from oven. 
 As soon as cakes are removed from oven, prick all over with skewer and pour slowly over them a mixture of  rum  and wine which the cakes will absorb. 
 Allow to remain in baking pans for 2 to 3 days to fully absorb  liquor  before serving.
