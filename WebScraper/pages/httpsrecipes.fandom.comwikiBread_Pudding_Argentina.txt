 so yummy : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup  Sugar 
 1 cup  water 
 1 white loaf of bread (stale) 
 4 cups  milk 
 6  eggs 
 1/2 cup  Sugar 
 1 tsp.  vanilla 
 Directions : 
 Combine  Sugar  and  water  in a saucepan, and stir constantly over low heat until  Sugar  is completely dissolved. 
 Increase heat to high, and allow to boil, without stirring again, until a nice golden color. 
 Pour into cake pan. 
 Try to coat the pan with the caramel but be careful not to burn your hands from splattering 
 Remove crusts from bread and cut into small cubes: you should have about 4 cups of crumb. 
 Pour over  milk , and allow to sit for 30-60 minutes. 
 With your hands, squish up the bread until it is one big mash. 
 Do not use a mixer or food processor, which would totally destroy the texture. 
 Beat  eggs  with  Sugar  and  vanilla  until light, and stir into the bread mixture to combine. 
 Pour bread mixture into pan. 
 Place cake tin in a baking dish full of  water , and bake in a moderate oven 50-60 min. until set. 
 Cool, and refrigerate overnight. 
 Remove from mold and serve.
