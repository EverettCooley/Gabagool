Jackie's Party  chili 
 
 1/2 Pound Dried  pinto beans 
 5 Cups Canned  tomatoes , Drained 
 4  green peppers , Chopped 
 6 T.  oil 
 1 1/2 Pound  onions , Chopped 
 2 cloves  garlic , Minced (i Usually Add More. i Love  garlic ) 
 1/2 Cup  parsley , Chopped 
 1/2 Cup  butter  or  margarine 
 2 1/2 Pounds Ground  Beef 
 1 Pound Lean Ground  Pork 
 1/3 Cup  chili powder 
 2 T.  salt 
 1 1/2 T.  cumin 
 1 T.  cocoa 
 
Wash beans And Soak Overnight in  water  to Cover. Next Day, Simmer beans in The Same  water  For 2 Hours. Add  tomatoes  And Simmer 6 More Minutes. in a Skillet, Saut? The  green peppers  in The  oil  For 5 Minutes. Add  onions  And Cook Until Tender, Stirring Constantly. Add  garlic  And  parsley  And Continue to Cook For 5 Minutes. in Another Skillet, Add  butter  And Melt. Add Meat And Cook 15 Minutes or Until Crumbly. Add Meat to The  Onion  Mixture And Stir in The  chili powder  And Cook 10 Minutes. Add This to The beans With The Remaining Ingredients. Stir Well. Simmer Covered, Over Very Low Heat For 1 Hour. Now, Uncover And Cook 30 Minutes Longer. Refrigerate Overnight. to Serve, Remove Excess Fat From The Top of The  chili  And Reheat on The Top of The Stove Over Very Low Heat. This Teaks a Couple of Days to Make, But it is Well Worth The Effort. it Seems it Takes Two Days For All The Ingredients to Get to Know One Another. Also, if Freezes Beautifully. i am Never Quite Sure How Many This Will Serve The Way Everyone at my House Eats It. i Will Take a Wild Stab And Say 10.
