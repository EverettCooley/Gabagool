 Description : 
 I ordered a Spanish Omlette at a beach restaurant on the Southern coast of Spain. It beats any Spanish omlette I've ever had.
 
 Ingredients : 
 ¼ cup chopped  red bell pepper 
 ¼ cup chopped  onion 
 1  tomato , diced, with juices 
 ¼ teaspoon  butter 
 2  eggs 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 Directions : 
 Preheat oven to 450 °F 
 Melt butter in heated cast iron skillet if you have one; otherwise, use your usual egg pan. 
 Combine red bell pepper and onion in pan; cook until soft but still crunchy. 
 Add tomato to pan. Stir; heat over medium heat until hot. 
 Gently break eggs into pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
 Place pan in oven. Bake until whites of eggs are set. 
 Remove and serve in pan.
