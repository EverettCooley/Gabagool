The Pallone di Gravina is a firm, cow's milk cheese from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in south-east Italy. It is made in the  pasta filata  style. The cheeses, which weigh between 1.5 and 2.5 kg, are shaped like a pear, ball or balloon (pallone) and were traditionally produced in the area of the city of Gravina in the Murgia area of the Province of Bari. Today, however, production is centred on the Province of Matera. The rind is hard, smooth and straw-coloured, becoming browner with age; the body, firm in texture, also starts out straw-yellow, but turns golden as the cheese matures. Pallone di Gravina is at its best after being aged for at least twelve months.
