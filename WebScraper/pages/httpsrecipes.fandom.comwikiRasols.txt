Description : 
 Latvian potato salad. This is a German- and Russian-inspired recipe, but I think it tastes better than either!
 
 Serves 6.

 Potato salad : 
 6  potatoes 
 6  eggs 
 6  pickles  (optional) 
 6  pickled beets , or equivalent in sliced  pickled beets  (optional)

 3 large dollops of  mayonnaise  (Hellman's, if possible)

 1 – 3 tsp  vinegar 
 ¼ – ½ tsp  salt 
 ¼ tsp  pepper 
 1 tsp  Worcestershire sauce  (optional) 
 Directions : 
 Boil  potatoes  until soft (but not until they are falling apart). 
 Hard boil  eggs . 
 Remove skins from  potatoes , and shells from  eggs . 
 Dice into fairly large chunks (about ½ inch in diameter). 
 Dice optional ingredients into smaller pieces. 
 Put all diced ingredients into a very large bowl. 
 Salad dressing : 
 Start with smaller amounts, and keep adding  sour cream ,  vinegar ,  mustard , etc. 
 Until it tastes good to you.
