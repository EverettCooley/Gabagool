 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 1 lrg Chopped  Onion 
 3 tbl olive oil 
 7 cup (about 3-1/2 pounds) drained  sauerkraut 
 1 tbl  paprika 
 2 tsp  caraway seeds  or cumin seeds 
 6 lb Roasting  Chicken 
 salt  and  pepper  as desired 
 Directions : 
 Here's another recipe which is a great favorite of ours, and which I clipped from a newspaper (Washington Post?) about 15 years ago. It's called 
 "Albanian  Chicken ", although I've never seen an Albanian Cookbook, and have never seen another Albanian recipe, it seems like something my great grandmother would have cooked. The use of  sauerkraut  as a stuffing seems weird, but is characteristic of Middle European cooking. You often find it mixed with  Apples ...here it's mixed with  paprika  and  caraway seeds . The stuffing is sensationally delicious, and the  Chicken  comes out extremely tender, every time. This is a recipe you have to cook to understand. 
 Saute  Onion  in  oil  until golden, stirring often. Combine  sauerkraut ,  paprika , and  caraway seeds  with  Onion . Spoon as much kraut mixture as possible into the body cavity of the  Chicken . Reserve remainder of kraut for later 
 Place  Chicken  on roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove pan from oven, take  Chicken  out. Pour off fat in bottom of pan. Spread remaining kraut in bottom of pan and set  Chicken  in pan. Bake another 1/2 to 1 hour to brown. Season as desired. 
 Leftovers make great sliced  Chicken  and  sauerkraut  sandwiches.
