Description : 
 Mother Martin's restaurant in Montreal, Canada makes the best  Onion  soup ever - more savoury than sweet! This recipe is the closest to it that I've ever tasted and came from a French Canadian friend who lived in Quebec City. The number of servings will depend on the size of your bowls and the thickness of the  French bread . Use Swiss or  Gruyère  if you prefer - it's your choice ..... Bon Appetit!!!
