 In a large bowl, combine the remaining all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, wheat germ, salt, and soda. 
 Using your fingers, work the unsalted butter into the flour mixture, rubbing the butter/flour mixture between your thumb and fingers. 
 Make a well in the center. 
 In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk. 
 Pour into the well in the flour mixture; stir until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Do not overmix.
