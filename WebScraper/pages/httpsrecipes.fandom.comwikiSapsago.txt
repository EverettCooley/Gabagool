       Sapsago cheese     
 About Sapsago : 
 Also known as Schbzieger, sapsago is a hard cone-shaped cheese from Switzerland. It's made from skimmed cows' milk and contains less than 10 percent fat. It has a light green color and pungent herbal flavor that come from the addition of blue melilot, a special variety of clover. Sapsago is used primarily for grating and adds interest to everything from salads to pasta.
