 About Shaggy mane mushrooms : 
 A mushroom that has an appearance similar to its name, with a white feathered appearing cap that is cylindrical in shape. Fairly common in the summer and fall season, this mushroom does not store well after being picked, so it is best to prepare it as soon as possible. Providing a mild flavor, the Shaggy Mane mushroom goes well in soups, eggs, with fish, and in sauces. As a cousin of the Inky Top mushroom.
