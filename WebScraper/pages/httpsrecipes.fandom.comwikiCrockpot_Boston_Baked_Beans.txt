Description : 
 I adapted my grandmother's Boston baked beans recipe that we make in the crockpot. I left the mustard in but there's so little of it that you could easily leave it out.

 Ingredients : 
 1 lb  small white dry beans 
 ⅛ pound of  salt pork  or  bacon  (my son is allergic to pork so I used shortening and a little bit of smoke flavoring) 
 3 tbsp  brown sugar 
 1 tsp  salt 
 3 tbsp  molasses 
 ½ tsp  mustard 
 1 medium  onion  diced 
 ¼ cup  catsup 
 Directions : 
 Prepare beans. 
 Wash beans and remove clinkers (small rocks). 
 Par boil in large pot or spaghetti cooker for 1½ hours. 
 Drain. 
 Place beans in slow cooker with other ingredients, add water just to cover the beans, and cook until beans are thick and dark brown, usually 8 – 12 hours stirring occasionally. 
 For variations add more onions or condiments. 
 For BBQ style, add chopped green pepper, double sugar and molasses and substitute BBQ sauce for catsup.
