This isn't exactly diet fare, but it's surprisingly refreshing on a hot
summer evening.
 
 Cold Lemon Soup
 
 4 cups (1 L) vegetable or chicken stock
 2 cups (500 ml) heavy cream
 2 Tbs (30 ml) cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with
 1/4 cup (60 ml) water
 6 egg yolks, beaten
 1/2 cup (125 ml) lemon juice
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 
 Bring the stock and cream to a simmer in a pot over moderate heat. Stir in
the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly
thickened. Stir a little of the mixture into the egg yolks, and then stir
the egg yolks into the soup. Stir over low heat until thickened - do not
boil. Chill in the refrigerator and stir in the lemon juice, salt, and
pepper immediately before serving. Serves 4 to 6.
