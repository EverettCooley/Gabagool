The recipe and text below are reprinted with permission from  The Low Carb Gourmet  by Karen Barnaby (©2004, Rodale). This fabulous book takes low carbing to new levels of sophistication. 
 Donald is a lowcarber.org success story. He's lost more than 100 pounds. Donald cuts the quiche into pieces and then freezes them to take to work for lunch. Of course, you can use any pizza toppings that you prefer. The mushrooms and sausage are my preference.
