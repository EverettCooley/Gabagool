Ingredients : 
 1 cup  tahini  (sesame butter) 
 ⅓ to ½ cup  maple syrup  (depending on your sweet tooth) 
 1 cup raw  oat bran 
 ½ cup raw  wheat germ 
 1 cup raw  sesame seeds 
 ½ cup toasted  sesame seeds 
 Directions : 
 In a bowl beat together the tahini and  maple syrup  with your electric mixer (or a wooden spoon, if you've got Xena arms). 
 Begin beating in the  oat bran ,  wheat germ  and raw  sesame seeds  until it takes on a very stiff-dough-like consistency. 
 You want to be able to roll it into little golf balls with your hands without it sticking to your fingers. 
 Keep adding more  oat bran  and  wheat germ  until it seems just right (amounts really depend on how liquidy your tahini is). 
 Roll the dough in the palms of your hands to make slightly-smaller-than-golf-ball sized spheres, and then roll them until completely coated in toasted  sesame seeds . 
 They are ready to eat at this point. 
 Store in your refrigerator in an airtight container.
