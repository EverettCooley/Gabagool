 About Misri : 
 In India the large crystalline form of sugar is called  Misri . The correct name in English should be "candy sugar". Word Misri comes from Chinese, originally Mi-Sha-Li, "sweet-pebble-glassy," a sweet crystalline (glassy) substance the size of pebbles.  Normal sugar  is in small crystals, which in a heap appear opaque-white or porcelain-white rather than transparent salt-white.
