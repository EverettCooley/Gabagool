 Ingredients : 
 9 Tbsp  butter , softened 
 ¼ tsp  salt 
 ¼ cup seedless  raisins  (optional) 
 2 large ripe  bananas  (1 lb.) 
 2 cup all purpose  flour 
 1 tsp  vanilla extract 
 1 Tbsp  baking powder 
 ½ cup  sugar 
 1  egg 
 ¾ cup unsalted  nuts  (optional) 
 ¼ tsp ground  nutmeg , preferably fresh 
 Directions : 
 Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
 Reserve ¼ cup of the most perfectly shaped  nuts  for the garnish. Chop the rest of the  nuts  coarsely and toss them with the  raisins  and 1 Tbs. of the  flour . Sift the remaining  flour  with the  baking powder ,  nutmeg  and  salt . 
 In a small bowl, mash the  bananas  to a smooth puree. Stir in the  vanilla  and set aside. 
 In a deep bowl,  cream  the remaining  butter  and the  sugar  together. 
 Add the  egg , and when it is well blended beat in the  flour  and the  bananas  alternately, adding about one third of each mixture at a time, and continue to beat until the batter is smooth. Gently but thoroughly stir in the chopped  nuts  and  raisins . 
 Pour batter into a greased loaf pan and arrange the reserved  nuts  attractively on the top. Bake the  bread  in the middle of the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Remove the  bread  from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it out on a wire cake rack. Serve the banana bread either warm or cool.
