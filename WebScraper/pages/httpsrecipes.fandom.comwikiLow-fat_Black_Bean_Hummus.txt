Description : 
 This is excellent served on warm pita wedges. Please note, this can be VERY spicy, depending on the amount of Tabasco and  garlic  used. 
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 can  garbanzo beans  (drained and rinsed) 
 1 can  black beans  (drained and rinsed) 
 1 – 2 cloves  garlic , minced (1 large clove or 2 – 3 small cloves) 
 2 – 4 tablespoon  cilantro , roughly chopped (I use about ¼ cup) 
 juice of 1  lemon 
 salt  and  pepper  to taste 
 dash of  Tabasco sauce 
 2 tablespoon  cumin 
 1 tablespoon fresh  parsley , roughly chopped 
 Directions : 
 Place all ingredients into a food processor and whiz until fairly smooth. 
 Does not have to be completely smooth, but you want to eliminate large chunks of  garlic .
