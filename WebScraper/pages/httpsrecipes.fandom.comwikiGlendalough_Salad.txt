 Description : 
 I love experimenting with salads. In April 2005 I assembled a new salad recipe and decided to call it the  Glendalough Salad  because my father's family came from Glendalough, Ireland and the salad contains cubed corned beef.
 
 Ingredients : 
 1 cup Riviera salad blend with  butter lettuce  and  radicchio 
 1 cup baby  spinach  trio (baby spinach,  arugula  and  carrots ) 
 2 slices of cooked  corned beef , cut into strips and then cubed 
 4 slices of thin  chicken  deli meat, cut into strips and then cubed 
 2 slices  Swiss cheese , cut into strips and then cubed 
 ¼ cup sliced fresh  mushrooms , cut in half and sliced again 
 12  green olives  with pimento but no pits, sliced 
 handful of  sweet onion , minced 
 ¼ cup  pecans , chopped 
 ranch dressing 
 Directions : 
 Remove fat from corned beef before cubing. 
 Assemble all meats and vegetables in a large bowl. 
 Stir in pecans, and then add ranch dressing. 
 Blend well. 
 Serve at once; makes enough for two servings. 
 Suggestions : 
 You can also use a different type of salad dressing other than Ranch, although I would not recommended adding an oil-based dressing such as Italian as it might smother the natural flavors of the salad. Pepper to taste would be good, although the salad really doesn't need any extra salt because of the corned beef and olives.
