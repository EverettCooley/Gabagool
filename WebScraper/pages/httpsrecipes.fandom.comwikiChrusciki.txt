      Chrusciki     
 Ingredients : 
 2 whole  eggs 
 10  egg yolks 
 1 tablespoon melted  butter 
 3 tablespoons  granulated sugar  (or  vanilla sugar ) 
 ½ teaspoon  salt 
 1 teaspoon pure  orange extract 
 1 teaspoon  pure vanilla extract 
 1 teaspoon freshly grated fresh  lemon  rind 
 1 teaspoon freshly grated  orange  rind 
 3 tablespoons  cognac 
 ½ cup  sour cream 
 4 – 5 cups  flour 
 melted Crisco, mixed with  lard 
 powdered sugar 
 Directions : 
 Beat the  eggs  and  egg yolks  together until thick and  lemon  colored. 
 Add the melted  butter ,  sugar ,  salt ,  extracts , citrus rinds,  cognac , and  sour cream  and beat until creamy and smooth. 
 Add enough  flour  gradually to produce a thick, fairly stiff dough. 
 Turn out onto a floured board and knead for 8 – 10 minutes until the dough is elastic and can be handled easily. 
 Roll pieces of dough ⅛ inch thin (should be able to see through them) and cut into strips about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide. 
 Cut the ends on a diagonal. 
 Slit each piece in the center and pull one end through the slit. 
 Heat the Crisco and  lard  to 375°F and fry the dough strips, until lightly browned (about 1 minute) drain on paper towels and sprinkle with  powdered sugar .
