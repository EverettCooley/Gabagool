 Description : 
 Ingredients : 
 2 oz dry cellophane or bean 
 thread noodles 
 2 cup peeled, seeded, and sliced 
 cucumbers 
 2 cup thinly sliced red bell 
 peppers  (i chopped them into 
 chunks ) 
 1 cup no- oil  italian dressing or 
 vinaigrette (i used less 
 than 1c -- about Â¾) 
 1 tbsp freshly minced  basil 
 1 tbsp freshly miced  cilantro 
 1/8 tbsp red hot  chile  flakes (i made* my own from dried chilis) 
 lettuce 
 Directions : 
 Drop the noodles into boiling  water  until done (length of time depends on type; read the label). Drain. Toss all ingredients together and marinate for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of  lettuce . Other tips: i used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The  chile  makes it hot so if you don"t like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may want to break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much). I made the mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut them a little in order to get my ingredients to combine properly. This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely because it isn"t too soupy. For those who care: 1c: 84 calories. .5 g total fat trace saturated fat 0 mg cholesterol from ornish"s "program for reversing heart disease"
